      <h1>What Is the Difference Between Ridley Scott and Joseph Goebbels?</h1>
      <p>I saw <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3659388/">The Martian</a>
this weekend, and it triggered a few thoughts. Of course, I didn't like
the movie as a
<a href="/2014/04/06/movies-for-thanasis.html">piece of art</a>.
It is total garbage, but this is not my point.
There is something bigger to discuss, aside from the bad acting, primitive
story-line, politically correct but absolutely unrealistic casting,
and tons of logical inconsistencies. It's Hollywood; what
should I expect, right? Not just that. I think the problem is bigger.</p>





<p>Have any of you seen this movie: <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0041562/">Cossacks of the Kuban</a>?
It was shot in 1949, when <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stalin">Joseph Stalin</a>
was in power, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union">Soviet Union</a>
was literally broke, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II">WWII</a>
brought people to the point of <strong>starvation</strong>.
However, the film showed something completely opposite—wealthy villages, rich peasants, and tables full of food.</p>

<p>It was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propaganda">propaganda</a> in 1949.</p>

<p>But isn't it quite similar to what I've just seen a few days ago,
produced and directed in 2015 by <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000631/">Ridley Scott</a>?</p>



<p>In 1949, the goal of Soviet propaganda was to convince people that
their personal situations with a lack of food and lack of future were
just their local, personal <strong>exceptions</strong> to a more general rule. And that
rule was that the country was full of food. The country was governed by
the principles of socialism, and they were working perfectly.</p>

<p>In 2015, the goal of Hollywood propaganda is to convince us that the
organizational and motivational problems in our
<a href="/2015/10/06/how-to-be-good-office-slave.html">offices</a> are just local exceptions to
the general rule. The rule is simple: project management is not important
if we're all good friends.</p>



<p>Ridley Scott is telling us that in a perfect organization, such as
<a href="https://www.nasa.gov/">NASA</a>,
everybody <strong>loves</strong> everyone; that's why they can get a man from Mars without
even a map. Do the same in your company and you will be fine. You don't
need risk planning, you just need a hero. Actually, you'd be better off
with a couple of heroes who love each other.</p>

<p>That doesn't work for you? It must be a problem with implementation.
Keep trying and smiling.</p>

<p>Make friends, don't make plans.</p>

<p>It is a lie, very similar to the lie we heard in 1949.</p>

<p>The truth is that you are not going to get anywhere if you follow
the spirit of this movie. In reality, teamwork must look completely
different. There are
<a href="/2017/01/03/how-much-you-love-conflicts.html">conflicts</a>,
fights, politics, betrayals, back-stabbing,
leakage of information, and just primitive incompetence. To manage all
this, one can't just be a <strong>nice guy</strong> with a big heart. I would even say
that being a nice guy is a drawback for any management position in a modern
organization. Well, in any organization at any time and in any place.</p>

<p>Project management is <a href="/2015/03/02/team-morale-myths-and-reality.html">not</a>
about compassion and sympathy. It is about
accurate and routine comparison of risks, probabilities, impacts, and
their mitigation plans. It is about
<a href="/2015/09/22/micromanagement.html">setting rules</a>
and making <strong>decisions</strong>. It is about making sure
these decisions are being executed, precisely and without mistakes.
It is about <a href="/2015/09/16/how-to-fire-someone-right.html">making sure</a>
those who've made mistakes are <strong>punished</strong> while those who've
done everything right are <strong>rewarded</strong>.</p>

<p>A team of six. In a multi-million-dollar spaceship.
Flying to another planet to save one person.
Against explicit instructions from upper management.
They come back as national heroes.
Are you serious?</p>

<p>Have you tried to deploy a new feature on a production server against
the direct will of your boss? Try it. No spaceships, no Mars. Just
a piece of code and a simple server. Then try to convince your boss
that you're a hero.</p>

<p>I'm sure you get the point.</p>



<p>So, why is Ridley Scott <strong>lying</strong> to us?
Why is he giving us a false picture of reality?
Intentionally <strong>false</strong>. He knows better than I do how real management
works in real-life organizations. Hollywood is not much different
than Silicon Valley in this aspect. So, why is he lying?</p>



<p>Why was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Goebbels">Joseph Goebbels</a>,
a minister of propaganda in the Third Reich,
lying to the German people?</p>

<p>Because that's what we like to hear, <strong>unfortunately</strong>.</p>

<p>It is sad, but we don't want to know the truth. We didn't want to know about
Nazi war crimes—so Joseph Goebbels built a <strong>fake</strong> reality for us.
We don't want to know about the true principles of management—so Ridley Scott built fake ones for us.</p>

<p>Think about it.</p>
