    <h1>Don't Create Objects That End With -ER</h1>
    <p>Manager. Controller. Helper. Handler. Writer. Reader. Converter. Validator.
Router. Dispatcher. Observer. Listener. Sorter. Encoder. Decoder.
This is the class names <strong>hall of shame</strong>. Have you seen them in your code?
In <a href="/2015/12/22/why-dont-you-contribute-to-open-source.html">open source libraries</a>
you&#39;re using? In pattern books? They are all wrong.
What do they have in common? They all end in &quot;-er&quot;. And what&#39;s wrong with that?
They are not classes, and the objects they instantiate are not objects.
Instead, they are collections of procedures pretending to be classes.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Coad">Peter Coad</a>
used to say: Challenge any class name that ends in &quot;-er&quot;. There
are a few good articles about this subject, including

and <a href="http://www.benhallbenhall.com/2013/01/naming-objects-er-object-names/">Naming Objects – Don’t Use ER in Your Object Names</a>
by Ben Hall.
The main argument against this &quot;-er&quot; suffix is that &quot;when you need a manager,
it&#39;s often a sign that the managed are just plain old data structures
and that the manager is the smart procedure doing the real work&quot;.</p>

<p>I totally agree but would like to add a few words to this.</p>

<p>I mentioned already in <a href="/2014/11/20/seven-virtues-of-good-object.html">Seven Virtues of a Good Object</a>
that a good object name is not a job title, but I didn&#39;t explain why I think so.
Besides that, in <a href="/2015/02/20/utility-classes-vs-functional-programming.html">Utility Classes Have Nothing to Do With Functional Programming</a>,
I tried to explain the difference between
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declarative_programming">declarative</a> and
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperative_programming">imperative</a> programming paradigms.
Now it&#39;s time to put these two pieces together.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s say I&#39;m an object and you&#39;re my client. You give me a bucket of apples
and ask me to sort them by size. If I&#39;m living in the world of imperative programming,
you will get them sorted immediately, and we will never interact again.
I will do my job just as requested, without even thinking <em>why</em> you need
them sorted. I would be a sorter who doesn&#39;t really care about your real intention:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span class="n">List</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">Apple</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">sorted</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="nf">Sorter</span><span class="o">().</span><span class="na">sort</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">apples</span><span class="o">);</span>
<span class="n">Apple</span> <span class="n">biggest</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">sorted</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">get</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="o">);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>As you see here, the real intention is to find the biggest apple in the bucket.</p>

<p>This is not what you would expect from a good business partner
who can help you work with a bucket of apples.</p>

<p>Instead, if I lived in the world of declarative programming, I would
tell you: &quot;<em>Consider them sorted; what do you want to do next?</em>&quot;. You, in turn,
would tell me that you need the biggest apple now. And I would say,
&quot;<em>No problem; here it is</em>&quot;. In order to return the biggest one, I would not
sort them all. I would just go through them all one by one and select the
biggest. This operation is much faster than sorting first and then selecting
the first in the list.</p>

<p>In other words, I would silently <strong>not</strong> follow your instructions but would
try to do my business my way. I would be a much smarter partner of yours
than that imperative sorter. And I would become a real object that behaves
like a sorted list of apples instead of a procedure that sorts:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span class="n">List</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">Apple</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">sorted</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="nf">Sorted</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">apples</span><span class="o">);</span>
<span class="n">Apple</span> <span class="n">biggest</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">sorted</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">get</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="o">);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>See the difference?</p>

<p>Pay special attention to the difference between the <code>sorter</code> and <code>sorted</code> names.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s get back to class names. When you add the &quot;-er&quot; suffix to your class name,
you&#39;re immediately turning it into a dumb imperative executor of <em>your</em> will.
You do not allow it to think and improvise. You expect it to do exactly
what you want &mdash; sort, manage, control, print, write, combine, concatenate, etc.</p>

<p>An object is a <a href="/2014/11/20/seven-virtues-of-good-object.html">living organism</a>
that doesn&#39;t want to be told what to do. It wants to be an equal partner with
other objects, exposing behavior according to its contract(s), a.k.a.
interfaces in Java and C# or protocols in Swift.</p>

<p>Philosophically speaking, the &quot;-er&quot; suffix is a sign of disrespect toward the poor object.</p>
