    <h1>Two Instruments of a Software Architect</h1>
    <p>A <a href="/2014/10/12/who-is-software-architect.html">software architect</a>
is a key person in any software project, no matter how big or small it is.
An architect is personally responsible for the technical outcome of
the entire team. A good architect knows what needs to be done and how
it&#39;s going to be done, both architecturally and design-wise. In order to enforce
this idea in practice, an architect uses two instruments:
<strong>bugs and reviews</strong>.</p>

<!--more-->



<p>At <a href="http://www.teamed.io">Teamed.io</a>, we discourage any communication
between developers unless they are formally attached to the tickets or tasks
we&#39;re working on. Read more details about this approach in
<a href="/2014/10/07/stop-chatting-start-coding.html">this post</a>.</p>

<p>The same principle applies to an architect. We don&#39;t use meetings,
stand-ups, Skype calls, IRC channels, or any other tools where information
flies in the air and stays in our heads. Instead, we put everything in writing and talk
only when we&#39;re being explicitly asked to and paid to &mdash; in tickets.</p>

<h2 id="bugs">Bugs</h2>

<p>With this in mind, a reasonable question may be asked: How can
a software architect enforce his or her technical vision for the team
if he can&#39;t communicate with the team? Here is our answer:
the architect must use <strong>bugs</strong>.</p>



<p>A bug is a ticket that has a reporter, a problem, and a resolver, just
like <a href="/2014/11/24/principles-of-bug-tracking.html">this post</a> explains.
Say an architect reviews an existing technical solution and finds
something that
<a href="/2015/06/22/valid-reasons-to-reject-bug-fix.html">contradicts</a>
his vision. When such a contradiction
is found, it is a good candidate for a bug. Sometimes there is just
not enough information in the code yet, and this is also a good candidate
for a bug.</p>

<p>Thus, bugs reported by an architect serve as communication channels
between him and the team. An architect doesn&#39;t explain what needs to be done
but asks the team to fix the product in a way he thinks is right.
If the ticket resolver, a member of the team, disagrees with that approach,
a discussion starts right in the ticket.</p>

<p>Sometimes an architect has doubts and needs to discuss a few possible solutions
with the team or simply collect opinions. Again, we use bugs for that.
But these bugs don&#39;t report problems in the source code; instead, they
complain about incomplete documentation. For example, say an architect
doesn&#39;t know which database to use, MongoDB or Cassandra, and needs more
information about their pros and cons. A bug will sound like &quot;our design documentation
doesn&#39;t have a detailed comparison of existing NoSQL databases; please fix it&quot;.
Whoever is assigned to this ticket will perform the comparison
and update the documentation.</p>

<p>Bugs are a <em>proactive</em> tool for an architect. Through reporting bugs,
an architect influences the project and &quot;dictates his will&quot;.</p>

<h2 id="reviews">Reviews</h2>

<p>In our projects, every ticket is implemented in its own branch. When
implementation is done, all tickets pass mandatory code peer review. In other
words, developers review each others&#39; code. An architect is not involved
in this process.</p>



<p>But when peer review is done, each ticket goes to an architect and he
has to give a final &quot;OK&quot; before the code goes to the <code>master</code> branch through
Rultor, our <a href="/2014/07/24/rultor-automated-merging.html">merge bot</a>.</p>

<p>This is an architect&#39;s opportunity for control. This is where he can
prevent his vision from being destroyed. When the code created by a developer
violates project design principles or any part of the entire technical idea,
the architect says &quot;No&quot; and the branch is rejected.</p>

<p>Reviews are a <em>reactive</em> instrument for an architect. Through strict and
non-compromising code reviews, an architect enforces his design and architectural
principles.</p>

<p>PS. Here is how an architect is supposed to report to the
