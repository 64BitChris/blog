      <h1>Constructors Must Be Code-Free</h1>
      <p>How much work should be done within a constructor? It seems reasonable
to do some computations inside a constructor and then encapsulate
results. That way, when the results are required by object methods, we'll have them
ready. Sounds like a good approach? No, it's not. It's a bad idea
for one reason: It prevents composition of objects and makes them
un-extendable.</p>





<p>Let's say we're making an interface that would represent a name of a person:</p>



<p>Pretty easy, right? Now, let's try to implement it:</p>



<p>What's wrong with this? It's faster, right? It splits the name into
parts only once and encapsulates them. Then, no matter how many times we
call the <code>first()</code> method, it will return the same value and won't need
to do the splitting again. However, this is flawed thinking! Let me show
you the right way and explain:</p>



<p>This is the right design. I can see you smiling, so let me prove my point.</p>

<p>Before I start proving, though, let me ask you to read this article:
<a href="/2015/02/26/composable-decorators.html">Composable Decorators vs. Imperative Utility Methods</a>.
It explains the difference between a static method and composable decorators.
The first snippet above is very close to an imperative utility method, even
though it looks like an object. The second example is a true object.</p>

<p>In the first example, we are abusing the <code>new</code> operator and turning it into
a static method, which does all calculations for us <em>right here and now</em>.
This is what <em>imperative</em> programming is about. In imperative programming,
we do all calculations right now and return fully ready results. In declarative
programming, we are instead trying to delay calculations for
as long as possible.</p>

<p>Let's try to use our <code>EnglishName</code> class:</p>



<p>In the first line of this snippet, we are just making an instance of an object
and labeling it <code>name</code>. We don't want to go to the database yet and fetch
the full name from there, split it into parts, and encapsulate them
inside <code>name</code>. We just want to create an instance of an object. Such a parsing
behavior would be a side effect for us and, in this case,
will slow down the application.
As you see, we may only need <code>name.first()</code> if something goes wrong and
we need to construct an exception object.</p>

<p>My point is that having <strong>any</strong> computations done inside a constructor is a bad
practice and must be avoided because they are side effects and are not
requested by the object owner.</p>

<p>What about performance during the re-use of <code>name</code>, you may ask. If we make an
instance of <code>EnglishName</code> and then call <code>name.first()</code> five times, we'll
end up with five calls to the <code>String.split()</code> method.</p>

<p>To solve that, we create another class,
a <a href="/2015/02/26/composable-decorators.html">composable decorator</a>,
which will help us solve this "re-use" problem:</p>



<p>I'm using the <a href="http://aspects.jcabi.com/annotation-cacheable.html"><code>Cacheable</code></a>
annotation from <a href="http://aspects.jcabi.com/">jcabi-aspects</a>, but you can use any other
caching tools available in Java (or other languages), like
<a href="https://code.google.com/p/guava-libraries/wiki/CachesExplained">Guava Cache</a>:</p>



<p>But please don't make <code>CachedName</code> mutable and lazily loaded —
it's an anti-pattern, which I've discussed before in
<a href="/2014/06/09/objects-should-be-immutable.html">Objects Should Be Immutable</a>.</p>

<p>This is how our code will look now:</p>



<p>It's a very primitive example, but I hope you get the idea.</p>

<p>In this design, we're basically splitting the object into two parts. The first
one knows how to get the first name from the English name. The second one
knows how to cache the results of this calculation in memory. And now it's
my decision, as a user of these classes, how exactly to use them. I will
decide whether I need caching or not. This is what object composition is all about.</p>

<p>Let me reiterate that the only allowed statement inside
a constructor is an assignment. If you need to put something else there,
start thinking about refactoring — your class definitely needs a redesign.</p>
