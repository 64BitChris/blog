    <h1>My Favorite Software Books</h1>
    <p>There are plenty of books about software engineering, but only a few of them rank
among my favorites. I read all of those that do over and over again, and I might
just update this post in the future when I stumble upon something else that&#39;s decent.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>Note that I tried to put the most important books at the top of the list.</p>



<p><a href="http://amzn.to/266oJr4"><strong>Object Thinking</strong></a>
by David West.
This is the best book I&#39;ve read about object-oriented
programming, and it totally changed my understanding of it. I would
recommend you read it a few times. But before reading, try to forget everything
you&#39;ve heard about programming in the past. Try to start from scratch. Maybe it will
work for you too :)</p>



<p><a href="http://amzn.to/266pAYB"><strong>PMP Exam Prep, Eighth Edition: Rita&#39;s Course in a Book for Passing the PMP Exam</strong></a>
by Rita Mulcahy.
This book is my favorite for project management. Even though it&#39;s about the
PMI approach and PMBOK in particular, it is a must-read for everyone who
is interested in management. Ignore the PMBOK specifics and focus on
the philosophy of project management and the role of
<a href="/2015/09/22/micromanagement.html">project manager</a> in it.</p>



<p><a href="http://amzn.to/1Y3qAbN"><strong>The Art of Software Testing</strong></a>
by Glenford J. Myers et al.
You can read my short review of this book <a href="/2014/08/22/art-of-software-testing.html">here</a>.
The book perfectly explains the philosophy of testing and destroys
many typical myths and stereotypes. No matter what your job description is,
if you&#39;re working in the software industry, you should understand testing
and its fundamental principles. This is the only book you need in order to
get that understanding.</p>



<p><a href="http://amzn.to/1PBpoDT"><strong>Growing Object-Oriented Software, Guided by Tests</strong></a>
by Steve Freeman and Nat Pryce.
All you need to know about your unit testing is in this book. I&#39;m fully aware
that I didn&#39;t include famous software engineer
<a href="http://amzn.to/1Y3pE7g">Kent Beck&#39;s book</a>
in this list because I don&#39;t like it at all. You definitely should read
it, just to know what&#39;s going on, but it won&#39;t help you write good tests.
Read this one instead, and read it many times.</p>



<p><a href="http://amzn.to/1SdcZ8M"><strong>Working Effectively With Legacy Code</strong></a>
by Michael Feathers.
This is awesome reading about modern software development, its pitfalls, and
typical failures. Most of the code we&#39;re working on now is legacy
(a.k.a. <a href="/2015/12/22/why-dont-you-contribute-to-open-source.html">open source</a>).
I read this book as a novel.</p>



<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321601912/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0321601912&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=yegor256com-20&amp;linkId=MPZUCBXBGNOIHDDI"><strong>Continuous Delivery: Reliable Software Releases Through Build, Test, and Deployment Automation</strong></a>
by Jez Humble and David Farley.
This is a perfect book about software delivery,
<a href="/2014/10/08/continuous-integration-is-dead.html">continuous integration</a>,
testing, packaging, versioning, and many other techniques involved in programming.
It&#39;s definitely a must-read for anyone who is serious about software engineering.</p>



<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596007647/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0596007647&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=yegor256com-20&amp;linkId=MWLP356M3CQZSBS7"><strong>XML in a Nutshell, Third Edition</strong></a>
by Elliotte Rusty Harold and W. Scott Means.
XML is my favorite standard. And I hated it before I read this book. I didn&#39;t
understand all the strange prefixes, namespaces, XPath expressions, and
schemes. Just this one book changed everything, and ever since reading it, I&#39;ve used XML
everywhere. It is very well written and easy to read. It&#39;s a must for everybody.</p>



<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321349601/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0321349601&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=yegor256com-20&amp;linkId=AN4H5FISUMRSU3XD"><strong>Java Concurrency in Practice</strong></a>
by Brian Goetz et al.
This is a very practical book about Java multi-threading, and at the same time,
it provides a lot of theoretical knowledge about concurrency in general. I highly
recommend you read it at least once.</p>



<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1491903996/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1491903996&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=yegor256com-20&amp;linkId=PUWBN5SFCGEQH3YH"><strong>Effective Modern C++: 42 Specific Ways to Improve Your Use of C++11 and C++14</strong></a>
by Scott Meyers.
No matter what language you&#39;re using, this book is very interesting and
very useful. It makes many important suggestions about better C++ coding. If
you understand most of them, your Java/Ruby/Python/Scala coding skills will
improve significantly.</p>



<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0735619670/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0735619670&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=yegor256com-20&amp;linkId=KWY7Y3BVH5URNCK3"><strong>Code Complete: A Practical Handbook of Software Construction, Second Edition</strong></a>
by Steve McConnell.
Consider this the bible of clean coding. Read it a few times and use it as a reference
manual in debates with your colleagues. It mentions the most terrible anti-patterns
and worst practices you&#39;ll see in modern programming. To be a good programmer,
you must know all of them.</p>



<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00JDMPOVQ/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00JDMPOVQ&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=yegor256com-20&amp;linkId=HDYS46EBUPXYSNDD"><strong>Software Estimation: Demystifying the Black Art</strong></a>
by Steve McConnell.
This one&#39;s an interesting read about software engineering and its most tricky part &mdash; estimations.
At the least, read it to be aware of the problem and possible solutions.</p>



<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0201702258/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0201702258&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=yegor256com-20&amp;linkId=VGRW6G3LUVKEB72C"><strong>Writing Effective Use Cases</strong></a>
by Alistair Cockburn.
An old and very good book, you won&#39;t actually use anything from this in your
real projects, but you will pick up the philosophy of use cases, which will
redirect your mind in the right direction. Don&#39;t take this book as something
practical; these use cases are hardly used anywhere today, but the idea of
scoping functionality this way is absolutely right.</p>



<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00JDMPMOA/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00JDMPMOA&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=yegor256com-20&amp;linkId=PRSWJK34HNP355LK"><strong>Software Requirements, Third Edition</strong></a>
by Karl Wiegers (author) and Joy Beatty.
A superb book about requirements analysis, the first and most important
activity in any software project. Even if you&#39;re not an analyst, this book
is a must-read.</p>



<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1449316387/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1449316387&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=yegor256com-20&amp;linkId=LTNZ7XPLDEG4MEJO"><strong>Version Control With Git: Powerful Tools and Techniques for Collaborative Software Development</strong></a>
by Jon Loeliger and Matthew McCullough.
This title serves as a practical guide for Git, a version control system. Read it from
cover to cover and you will save many hours of your time in the future.
Git is a de-facto standard in version control, and every programmer must
know its fundamental principles &mdash; not from a cheat sheet but from an original source.</p>



<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004XQX4K0/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B004XQX4K0&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=yegor256com-20&amp;linkId=U37POLMQHPZMXXAP"><strong>JavaScript: The Definitive Guide: Activate Your Web Pages</strong></a>
by David Flanagan.
JavaScript is a language of the modern Web, and this book explains it very well.
No matter what kind of software you develop, you must know JavaScript. Don&#39;t read
it as a practical guide (even though it&#39;s called a guide) but rather as
food for thought. JavaScript offers a lot to learn for Java/Ruby/Python developers.</p>



<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00457X7L8/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00457X7L8&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=yegor256com-20&amp;linkId=PSW6X7D2VCCBS6OL"><strong>CSS: The Definitive Guide</strong></a>
by Eric A. Meyer.
CSS is not just about colors and shadows, and it&#39;s not only for graphic designers.
CSS is a key language of the modern Web. Every developer must know it, whether
you&#39;re working with a back-end, front-end, or desktop application in C++.</p>
