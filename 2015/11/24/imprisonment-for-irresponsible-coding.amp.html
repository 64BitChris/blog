      <h1>Imprisonment for Irresponsible Coding!</h1>
      <p>If I drive too fast and I get caught, I may get a ticket. If I drive
under the influence and get caught, I may go to jail. If I turn my
radio up too loud in the middle of the night and my neighbors call the police,
I may get into trouble if I don&#39;t stop it. The law basically protects
us from causing trouble with each other. Why don&#39;t we have a law
against <strong>irresponsible coding</strong>?</p>

<p>Software is part of my life. It actually <strong>is</strong> my <strong>life</strong>, not just part of it. I stare
at this MacBook for much more time every day than I drive, talk, or listen
to the radio.</p>

<p>Code is the <strong>territory</strong> where I
<a href="/2014/10/07/stop-chatting-start-coding.html">interfere</a>
with others, and this is where
we may bother each other. Irresponsible coding is precisely how one
of us can really disturb the other. So why don&#39;t the <strong>police</strong> protect
me against, say, authors of Apache Hadoop?</p>

<p>They created something that turns part of my life into a nightmare &mdash; much
faster and much more severely than drunk drivers. So, where is
the police? Why aren&#39;t they protecting me, for my tax dollars? Why
aren&#39;t those Java guys in <strong>jail</strong> yet? :)</p>

<p>We need a law against irresponsible coding!</p>

<p>How about two months of imprisonment for a
