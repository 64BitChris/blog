      <h1>Ringelmann Effect vs. Agile</h1>
      <p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ringelmann_effect">Ringelmann Effect</a>
(a.k.a. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_loafing">social loafing</a>)
is basically about people experiencing <strong>decreasing</strong> productivity
when working in groups. We&#39;re basically more productive when
we work individually to achieve personal goals rather than being
teamed up. That was discovered by Prof. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Ringelmann">Max Ringelmann</a> a hundred
years ago in 1913. Today, during my workshop in Berlin at
<a href="http://distributed-agile-teams.org/workshops/">DATFlock 2015</a>, we tried
to reproduce that experiment. It seems the French professor was right.</p>

<!--more-->



<p>Here is what we did. We created two groups with four people in each of them,
all non-native English speakers. Then, both groups received the same
task &mdash; to create as many words as possible using the letters in a single given word.
It&#39;s a pretty simple task that just requires some time and creativity.</p>

<p>The first group worked as a team. They had just one piece of paper
and one pen to write down the words they found. We called them a
<strong>co-located</strong> team.</p>

<p>The second group of four people worked in a <strong>distributed</strong> mode &mdash;
they had four pieces of paper and four pens. They didn&#39;t communicate with
each other and just created words. They knew that the best performer
would receive a prize (a bar of organic chocolate).</p>

<p>I promised a prize to the co-located team too. A very similar chocolate bar.</p>

<p>We gave them both just 5 minutes.</p>

<p>Our result was this: <strong>38 words</strong> found by a co-located team and <strong>41 words</strong>
found by a distributed team. Of course, we removed duplicates and non-English
words.</p>

<p>The distributed team was <strong>8 percent</strong> more productive than the co-located one.</p>

<p>Of course, this may not be a clear experiment, and we can&#39;t use these numbers
to really prove anything, but it was interesting to see how groups work and what
actually motivates us to achieve results. We had an hour-long discussion afterward
in an attempt to find out what each group member felt while working in a group
or individually.</p>

<p>You can try to repeat this (or a similar experiment) in your team and check
the results. Post them below in the comments; it would be interesting to see whether
it does or doesn&#39;t work in your case.</p>

<p>Now, my main question. If I understand it right, Agile promotes group
responsibility and discourages <strong>individualism</strong>. How does it go along
with the Ringelmann Effect? Any thoughts?</p>
