      <h1>Wikipedia's Definition of a Software Bug Is Wrong</h1>
      <p>Here is what <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_bug">Wikipedia says</a>
at the time of this writing:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A software bug is an error, flaw, failure, or fault
in a computer program or system that causes it
to produce an incorrect or unexpected result or
to behave in unintended ways.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think that&#39;s incomplete. The definition entirely excludes &quot;non-behavioral&quot;
defects related to, for example, <strong>maintainability</strong> and <strong>reusability</strong>.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>As you know, every piece of software has <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_requirement">functional</a>
and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-functional_requirement">non-functional</a>
requirements.
Functional requirements tell us <em>what</em> the software has to do, and non-functional
requirements document <em>how</em> it has to do it. For example, here is a functional
requirement:</p>



<p>If our software doesn&#39;t generate a PDF report and crashes instead,
that&#39;s a functional bug. If instead of a PDF report, it generates an empty
page or a plain text document, that&#39;s a functional bug. If there
is no &quot;generate PDF report&quot; button at all and the user simply can&#39;t start
the PDF generation process, that&#39;s a functional bug.</p>

<p>Here is an example of a non-functional requirement:</p>



<p>If our software generates a perfectly correct PDF report but it
takes a minute, that&#39;s a non-functional bug.</p>

<p>So far so good, since the bug definition given by Wikipedia perfectly
covers both of them &mdash; if they happen, they will cause our software
&quot;to <em>produce</em> an incorrect or unexpected result or to <em>behave</em> in an unintended way.&quot;
The emphasis here is on the words &quot;produce&quot; and &quot;behave.&quot; They presume
the software is doing something and we&#39;re observing its behavior.</p>

<p>However, that&#39;s not all of it.</p>

<p>What about maintainability? I may have this kind of non-functional requirement:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">The source code of the PDF generator must be
easy to maintain and extend for an average
Java programmer.</code></pre></figure>

<p>It&#39;s a rather vague requirement, but you get the idea.</p>

<p>Maintainability and reusability are very critical non-functional components
of any modern software program, especially taking into account a very high
cost of labor in the market. Very often, it&#39;s more important to make sure
the software is maintainable than fast. If it&#39;s maintainable and slow, we
can find new programmers to <em>improve</em> the code. If it is fast
but unmaintainable, we won&#39;t be able to do anything with it later and will
have to <em>rewrite</em> it from scratch if some new feature is required.
Read more about this in
<a href="/2014/10/26/hacker-vs-programmer-mentality.html">Are You a Hacker or a Designer?</a>.</p>

<p>The definition of a software bug given by Wikipedia doesn&#39;t cover
maintainability and reusability flaws at all.
That makes for a common source of confusion &mdash;
an inconsistent code style is not a bug (see the discussion under
<a href="/2014/08/13/strict-code-quality-control.html">this post</a>).</p>

<p>That is wrong.</p>

<p>An inconsistent code style <strong>is</strong> a software bug, as is incomplete documentation,
lack of documentation, code that&#39;s too complex, the lack of a coding style guide,
etc.</p>

<p>I would rewrite the software bug definition paragraph in Wikipedia like this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A software bug is an error, flaw, failure, or fault
in a computer program or system that causes it
to violate at least one of its functional or
non-functional requirements.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This definition looks more accurate to me.</p>
