      <h1>Vertical vs. Horizontal Decomposition of Responsibility</h1>
      <p>Objects responsible for too many things are a problem. Because their
complexity is high, they are difficult to maintain and extend.
<strong>Decomposition of responsibility</strong> is what we do in order to break
these overly complex objects into smaller ones. I see two types of this
refactoring operation: vertical and horizontal. And I believe
the former is better than the latter.</p>





<p>Let's say this is our code (it is Ruby):</p>



<p>Obviously, objects of this class are doing too much.
They save log lines to the
file and also format them â€” an obvious violation of
a famous
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle">single responsibility principle</a>.
An object of this class would be <strong>responsible</strong> for too many things.
We have to extract some functionality out of it and put that
into another object(s). We have to <strong>decompose</strong> its responsibility.
No matter where we put it, this is how the
<code>Log</code> class will look after the extraction:</p>



<p>Now it only saves lines to the file, which is perfect. The class
is cohesive and small. Let's make an instance of it:</p>



<p>Next, where do we put the lines with formatting functionality that were just extracted?
There are two approaches to decompose responsibility: horizontal and
vertical. This one is <strong>horizontal</strong>:</p>



<p>In order to use <code>Log</code> and <code>Line</code> together, we have to do this:</p>



<p>See why it's horizontal? Because this script sees them
both. They both are on the same level of visibility. We will always have
to communicate with both of them when we want to log a line. Both
objects of <code>Log</code> and <code>Line</code> are in front of us. We have to deal with
two classes in order to log a line:</p>

<p></p>

<p>To the contrary, this decomposition of responsibility is <strong>vertical</strong>:</p>



<p>Class <code>TimedLog</code> is a decorator, and this is how we use them together:</p>



<p>Now, we just put a line in the log:</p>



<p>The responsibility is decomposed vertically. We still have one entry point
into the <code>log</code> object, but the object "consists" of two objects, one wrapped
into another:</p>

<p></p>

<p>In general, I think horizontal decomposition of responsibility is a bad idea,
while vertical is a much better one. That's because a vertically
decomposed object decreases complexity, while a horizontally decomposed
one actually makes things more complex because its clients have to deal with
more dependencies and more points of contact.</p>
