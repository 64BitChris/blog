      <h1>If-Then-Else Is a Code Smell</h1>
      <p>In most cases (maybe even in all of them), if-then-else can and must
be replaced by a decorator or simply another object.
I've been planning to write about this for almost a year but only today found
a real case in my own code that perfectly
illustrates the problem. So it's time to demonstrate it and explain.</p>





<p>Take a look at the class
<a href="https://github.com/yegor256/rultor/blob/1.61.9/src/main/java/com/rultor/dynamo/DyTalk.java"><code>DyTalk</code></a>
from
<a href="https://github.com/yegor256/rultor">yegor256/rultor</a>
and its method
<a href="https://github.com/yegor256/rultor/blob/1.61.9/src/main/java/com/rultor/dynamo/DyTalk.java#L127-L169"><code>modify()</code></a>.
In a nutshell, it prevents you from saving any data to the DynamoDB if there were no
modifications of the XML document. It's a valid case, and it has to be
validated, but the way it's implemented is simply wrong. This is
how it works (an oversimplified example):</p>



<p>What's wrong, you wonder? This if-then-else forking functionality doesn't really belong
to this object â€” that's what's wrong. Modifying the XML document
and saving it to the database is <em>its functionality</em>, while
not saving anything if the modification instructions set is empty is not
(it's very similar to <a href="/2016/01/26/defensive-programming.html">defensive programming</a>).
Instead, there should be a decorator, which would look like this:</p>



<p>Now, if and when we need our talk to be more clever in situations where
the list of directives is empty, we decorate it with <code>QuickTalk</code>.
The benefits are obvious: the <code>DyTalk</code> class is smaller and therefore
more cohesive.</p>



<p>But the question is bigger than just that. Can we make a rule out of it? Can we say that
<strong>each and every forking</strong> is bad and should be moved out of a class? What about
forking that happens inside a method and can't be converted to a decorator?</p>

<p>I'm suggesting this simple rule: If it's possible to convert if-then-else forking
to a decorator, it has to be done. If it's not done, it's a code smell.
Make sense?</p>
