      <h1>What's Wrong With Object-Oriented Programming?</h1>
      <p>Recently, I was trying to convince a few of my readers that
<a href="/2016/07/14/who-is-object.html">a better understanding of an object</a>
in OOP would help us solve many problems in existing pseudo-object-oriented languages.
Then, suddenly, the question came up: "<strong>What problems?</strong>"
I was puzzled. I thought it was obvious that the vast majority of modern software
written in modern OO languages is unmaintainable and simply a mess.
So I Googled a bit, and this is what I found (in chronological order).</p>







<div class="clear"></div>



<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edsger_W._Dijkstra">Edsger W. Dijkstra</a>
in "TUG LINES", Issue 32, August 1989:
"Object oriented programs are offered as alternatives to correct ones"
and
"Object-oriented programming is an exceptionally bad idea
which could only have originated in California."</p>

I did not have C++ in mind."</p>

in <a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.version-control.git/57918/">this email</a>:
"C++ is a horrible language. ...
C++ leads to really, really bad design choices. ...
In other words, the only way to do good, efficient, and system-level and
portable C++ ends up to limit yourself to all the things that are
basically available in C. And limiting your project to C means that people
don't screw that up, and also means that you get a lot of programmers that
do actually understand low-level issues and don't screw things up with any
idiotic 'object model' crap."</p>

"OOP is about taming complexity through modeling, but we have not
mastered this yet, possibly because we have difficulty distinguishing
real and accidental complexity."</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/richhickey">Rich Hickey</a>
at <a href="http://www.se-radio.net/2010/03/episode-158-rich-hickey-on-clojure/">SE Radio</a>, Episode 158:
"I think that large objected-oriented programs struggle
with increasing complexity as you build this large object graph of
mutable objects. You know, trying to understand and keep in your mind
what will happen when you call a method and what will the side effects be."</p>

<p><a href="http://joearms.github.io/">Joe Armstrong</a>
in <a href="http://harmful.cat-v.org/software/OO_programming/why_oo_sucks">Why OO Sucks</a>:
"Objects bind functions and data structures together in
indivisible units. I think this is a fundamental error since functions and
data structures belong in totally different worlds."</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Pike">Rob Pike</a>
<a href="https://plus.google.com/+RobPikeTheHuman/posts/hoJdanihKwb">here</a>:
"Object-oriented programming, whose essence is nothing more than
programming using data with associated behaviors, is a powerful idea.
It truly is. But it's not always the best idea. ...
Sometimes data is just data and functions are just functions."</p>

in <a href="https://blog.pivotal.io/labs/labs/all-evidence-points-to-oop-being-bullshit">All evidence points to OOP being bullshit</a>:
"What OOP introduces are abstractions that attempt to improve code
sharing and security. In many ways, it is still essentially procedural code."</p>

in <a href="http://www.smashcompany.com/technology/object-oriented-programming-is-an-expensive-disaster-which-must-end">Object Oriented Programming is an expensive disaster which must end</a>:
"We now know that OOP is an experiment that failed.
It is time to move on. It is time that we, as a community, admit that
this idea has failed us, and we must give up on it."</p>

<hr>

<p>I can't prove this quote (maybe you can help?):</p>

<p>Alan Kay:
"Java and C++ make you think that the new ideas are like the old ones.
Java is the most distressing thing to happen to computing since MS-DOS."</p>
