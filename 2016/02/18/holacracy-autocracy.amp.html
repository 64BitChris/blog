      <h1>Holacracy or Autocracy? Both!</h1>
      <p>I strongly believe that while it is very effective to structure
an organization in a democratic and sociocratic way, a project
should be managed completely different.
A project should resemble a dictatorship, authoritarian or military hierarchy
with a single strong, result-oriented leader who gives explicit orders
that are never doubted by subordinates and an explicitly defined hierarchy.</p>

<p>According to Wikipedia at the time of writing, a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holacracy"><strong>holacracy</strong></a> exists when
&quot;authority and decision-making are distributed&quot; while,
on the other hand,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autocracy"><strong>autocracy</strong></a> exists when
&quot;supreme power is concentrated in the hands of one person&quot;.</p>

<p>When I say organization, I mean a team, a startup, a company, that
sort of thing. It&#39;s something with a brand, an office, a business entity
and a bank account. The role of an organization is very similar
to the role of a country or a government: to provide security
in exchange for freedom. Democracy in a country, as well as in a team,
guarantees <strong>equality</strong> to its members,
which is the most important component of security.</p>

<p>A holacracy, also known as a &quot;flat organization&quot;, technically refers to the absence
of bureaucracy, special privileges, expensive furniture and private parties
for top management. In a flat team, the distance between the CEO and
a junior programmer is very small. They sit together in the same room,
eat in the same cafe, and discuss team strategy like friends. There
are no &quot;bosses&quot; on a flat team, only &quot;<strong>leaders</strong>&quot;. They don&#39;t give orders, they
<strong>inspire</strong>. They don&#39;t punish, they celebrate success and mourn failure
together with everybody. Well, that&#39;s the idea of a holacracy.
And it actually works. I&#39;ve seen it many times.</p>



<p>However, when we&#39;re talking about <strong>project</strong> management, this very same approach will
have catastrophic consequences. A project is something very different
than a team. A project is a &quot;temporary endeavor
undertaken to create a unique product, service, or result&quot;, according to
<a href="http://www.pmi.org/PMBOK-Guide-and-Standards.aspx">PMBOK</a>.
A project is something that starts and ends. The key objective of a project
is to <strong>end</strong>, while an organization&#39;s objective is to <strong>survive</strong>. See the
difference? A new mobile app, a conference, a new release, a round of
investments &mdash; these are examples of projects. They start, and they end. We
don&#39;t want any of them to live forever; we want them to finish as soon as
possible, and obviously with a positive outcome.</p>

<p>Because of this fundamental difference, a project must be managed by
an authoritative person who gives orders and
has enough guts to ensure those orders are obeyed. That person is
called a <strong>project manager</strong> (PM). And the project will be successful only if
its management structure is strictly hierarchical, just like in a military operation.
A project cannot be flat, or it will fall apart.</p>

<p>Since a project is a temporary endeavor, it doesn&#39;t give security to its
participants. And it doesn&#39;t take away our freedom. The arrangement is
different: A project gives us <strong>money</strong> and takes our <strong>time</strong>. The project
basically says to all of us, its participants: &quot;Let&#39;s get it done and go
our own ways&quot;. Having this philosophy in mind and understanding the motivation
of everybody involved, the PM must use instruments that have nothing to do
with what keeps the organization alive.</p>



<p>An organization/team/company/family will stay together for a long time if
we value things like tolerance, respect, patience, equality, and appreciation.</p>

<p>To the contrary, a project will finish successfully if we value completely
different things: discipline, subordination, awards, punishments, and rules.</p>

<p>To summarize my thoughts, I would say that a successful company combines
these two approaches by being a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_management">matrix</a>
organization that promotes holacracy in the team and autocracy in
the projects it is working on.</p>
