      <h1>Can Objects Be Friends?</h1>
      <p>As <a href="/2016/11/21/naked-data.html">discussed before</a>,
proper encapsulation leads to a complete absence
of "naked data." However, the question remains: How can objects
interact if they can't exchange data? Eventually we have to expose
some data in order to let other objects use it, right? Yes, that's true.
However, I guess I have a solution that keeps encapsulation in place
while allowing objects to interact.</p>





<p>Say that this is our object:</p>



<p>It represents a temperature. The only behavior it exposes is printing
the temperature in Celsius. We don't want to expose <code>t</code>, because
that will lead to the <a href="/2016/11/21/naked-data.html">"naked data"</a>
problem. We want to keep <code>t</code> secret, and that's a good desire.</p>

<p>Now, we want to have the ability to print temperature in Fahrenheit. The most
obvious approach would be to introduce another method, <code>toFahrenheitString()</code>,
or add a Boolean flag to the object, which will change the behavior
of method <code>toString()</code>, right? Either one of these solutions is better than adding
a method <code>getT()</code>, but neither one is perfect.</p>

<p>What if we create this decorator:</p>



<p>It should work just great:</p>



<p>The only problem is that it won't compile in Java, because class
<code>TempFahrenheit</code> is not allowed to access private <code>t</code> in class <code>TempCelsius</code>.
And if we make <code>t</code> public, everybody will be able to read it directly, and we'll have
that "naked data" problem—a severe violation of encapsulation.</p>

<p>However, if we allow that access <em>only</em> to one class, everything will be fine.
Something like this (won't work in Java; it's just a concept):</p>



<p>Since this <code>trust</code> keyword is placed into the class that allows access,
we won't have the "naked data" problem—we will always know exactly which
objects posses knowledge about <code>t</code>. When we change
something about <code>t</code>, we know exactly where to update the code.</p>

<p>What do you think?</p>

<p>P.S. After discussing this idea below in comments I
<a href="http://www.yegor256.com/2016/12/20/can-objects-be-friends.html#comment-3068629632">started</a> to think
that we don't need that <code>trust</code> keyword at all. Instead, we should just
give all decorators access to all private attributes of an object.</p>
