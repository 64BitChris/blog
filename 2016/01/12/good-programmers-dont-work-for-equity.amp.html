    <h1>Good Programmers Don't Work for Equity</h1>
    <p>&quot;You&#39;re a good programmer. I&#39;m a great entrepreneur. This is a
breakthrough idea. Help me build it. I don&#39;t have cash, but I will
give you equity. Deal?&quot; I hear this at least once a month, and
I always say no. Not because I don&#39;t like your idea. Indeed, it
is really interesting. And not because I&#39;m too busy. I would
definitely find time for a good idea. It&#39;s not that. I say no because
I don&#39;t think you&#39;re a good entrepreneur.</p>

<!--more-->



<p>So you want a good programmer to build your product. Or maybe a group
of good programmers. And you are ready to give me some equity
in exchange. That&#39;s reasonable.</p>



<p>But what is your part of the deal?</p>

<p>How much are you putting on the table?</p>

<p>You say that you&#39;re a good entrepreneur, right? How come
you don&#39;t have money, then? How come you can&#39;t find someone to pay
for the work of a good programmer?</p>

<p>I will create a product for you, but you will most certainly
fail. You <strong>already</strong> failed. You failed to find initial
investment to cover the startup expenses of the business.
Why do you think you will succeed after the product is ready?</p>

<p>The point is that a good programmer will <strong>never</strong>
work for equity. Not because a good programmer is greedy,
or doesn&#39;t want to risk, or doesn&#39;t believe
in new ideas. Not at all.</p>

<p>A good programmer wants to work with a <strong>good</strong> entrepreneur. And
a good entrepreneur knows how to find money. That&#39;s the definition
of a decent entrepreneur.</p>

<p>Period.</p>
