      <h1>Gradients of Immutability</h1>
      <p>Good objects are immutable, but not necessarily constants.
I tried to explain it <a href="/2014/06/09/objects-should-be-immutable.html">here</a>,
<a href="/2014/12/09/immutable-object-state-and-behavior.html">here</a>, and
<a href="/2014/12/22/immutable-objects-not-dumb.html">here</a>,
but now it's time to make another attempt. Actually, the more I think about it,
the more I realize that immutability is not black or white—there
are a few more gradients; let's take a look.</p>





<p>As we agreed <a href="/2016/07/14/who-is-object.html">here</a>,
an object is a <strong>representative</strong> of someone else
(some entity or entities, other object(s), data, memory, files, etc.).
Let's examine a number of objects that look exactly the same
to us but <strong>represent</strong> different things, then analyze how
immutable they are and why.</p>

<h2 id="constant">Constant</h2>

<p>This is <strong>constant</strong>; it doesn't allow any modifications
to the encapsulated entity and always returns the same text
(I've skipped constructors for the sake of brevity):</p>



<p>This is what we usually have in mind when talking about immutable
objects. Such a class is very close to a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_function">pure function</a>,
which means that no matter how many times we instantiate it with
the same initial values, the result of <code>title()</code> will be the same.</p>

<h2 id="not-a-constant">Not a Constant</h2>

<p>Check out this one:</p>



<p>The object is still immutable, but it is not a pure
function anymore because of the method <code>title()</code>—it returns different values if we call it
multiple times with at least a one-minute interval. The object
is immutable; it's just not a constant anymore.</p>

<h2 id="represented-mutability">Represented Mutability</h2>

<p>How about this one:</p>



<p>This <em>immutable</em> object keeps the book title in a file. It's not a constant,
because its method <code>title()</code> may return different values on every
second call. Moreover, the represented entity (the file) is not a constant.
We can't say whether it's mutable or immutable, as we don't know how <code>Files.write()</code>
is implemented. But we know for sure that it's not a constant, because it
accepts change requests.</p>

<h2 id="encapsulated-mutability">Encapsulated Mutability</h2>

<p>An immutable object may not only represent but even
encapsulate a mutable one. Just like in the
previous example, a mutable file was encapsulated. Even though it
was represented by the immutable class <code>Path</code>, the real file on disk
was mutable. We can do the same, but in memory:</p>



<p>The object is still <em>immutable</em>. Is it
<a href="/2017/01/17/synchronized-decorators.html">thread-safe</a>? No. Is it a constant?
No. Is it immutable? Yes. Confused? You bet.</p>

<hr>

<p>My point is that immutability is not <em>binary</em>; there are many
forms of it. The most simple one is, of course, a
constant. Constants are almost the same as pure functions in functional
programming. But object-oriented programming allows us to take
a few steps forward and give immutable objects more permissions
and flexibility. In OOP, we may have many more forms of immutability.</p>

<p>What is common among all these examples is that our objects are
<strong>loyal</strong> to the entities they encapsulate. There are no
<a href="/2014/09/16/getters-and-setters-are-evil.html">setters</a>
that could change them. All encapsulated objects are <code>final</code>.</p>

<p>This is the only quality that differentiates mutable objects from
immutable ones. The latter are always loyal to the entities they
encapsulate and represent. For all the rest ... it depends.</p>
