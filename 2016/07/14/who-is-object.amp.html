      <h1>Who Is an Object?</h1>
      <p>There are thousands of books about object-oriented programming and
hundreds of object-oriented languages, and I believe most (read &quot;all&quot;) of them
give us an incorrect definition of an &quot;object&quot;. That&#39;s why the entire
OOP world is so full of misconceptions and mistakes. Their
definition of an object is limited by the hardware architecture they
are working with and that&#39;s why is very primitive and mechanical.
I&#39;d like to introduce a better one.</p>

<p>What is an object? I&#39;ve done a little research, and this is what I&#39;ve found:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>&quot;Objects may contain data, in the form of fields, often known as attributes;
and code, in the form of procedures, often known as methods&quot;
&mdash; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming">Wikipedia</a> at the time of writing.</p></li>
<li><p>&quot;An object stores its state in fields and exposes its behavior through methods&quot;
&mdash; <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/concepts/object.html">What Is an Object?</a> by Oracle.</p></li>
<li><p>&quot;Each object looks quite a bit like a little computer &mdash;
it has a state, and it has operations that you can ask it to perform&quot;
&mdash; <a href="http://amzn.to/1PBmQpm">Thinking in Java</a>, 4th Ed., Bruce Eckel, p. 16.</p></li>
<li><p>&quot;A class is a collection of data fields that hold values
and methods that operate on those values&quot;
&mdash; <a href="http://amzn.to/28PEqSi">Java in a Nutshell</a>, 6th Ed., Evans and Flanagan, p. 98.</p></li>
<li><p>&quot;An object is some memory that holds a value of some type&quot;
&mdash; <a href="http://amzn.to/1XyGCtk">The C++ Programming Language</a>, 4th Ed., Bjarne Stroustrup, p. 40.</p></li>
<li><p>&quot;An object consists of some private memory and a set of operations&quot;
&mdash; <a href="http://amzn.to/1UhYinp">Smalltalk-80</a>, Goldberg and Robson, p. 6.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>What is common throughout all these definitions is the word &quot;contains&quot; (or &quot;holds&quot;,
&quot;consists&quot;, &quot;has&quot;, etc.). They all think that an object is a <em>box with data</em>.
And this perspective is exactly what I&#39;m strongly against.</p>

<p>If we look at how C++ or Java are implemented, such a definition of an
object will sound <em>technically</em> correct. Indeed, for each object, Java Virtual
Machine allocates a few bytes in memory in order to store object
attributes there. Thus, we can technically say, in that language,
that an object is an in-memory box with data.</p>

<p>Right, but this is just a corner case!</p>

<p>Let&#39;s try to imagine another object-oriented language that doesn&#39;t
store object attributes in memory. Confused? Bear with me for a minute.
Let&#39;s say that in that language we define an object:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">c {
  vin: v,
  engine: e
}</code></pre></figure>

<p>Here, <code>vin</code> and <code>engine</code> are attributes of object <code>c</code> (it&#39;s a car; let&#39;s
forget about classes for now to focus strictly on objects). Thus, there is
a simple object that has two attributes. The first one is car&#39;s VIN, and the
second one is its engine. The VIN is an object <code>v</code>, while the engine is <code>e</code>.
To make it easier to understand, this is how a similar object would
look in Java:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span class="kt">char</span><span class="o">[]</span> <span class="n">v</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="o">{</span><span class="sc">&#39;W&#39;</span><span class="o">,</span><span class="sc">&#39;D&#39;</span><span class="o">,</span><span class="sc">&#39;B&#39;</span><span class="o">,</span><span class="sc">&#39;H&#39;</span><span class="o">,...</span><span class="sc">&#39;7&#39;</span><span class="o">,</span><span class="sc">&#39;2&#39;</span><span class="o">,</span><span class="sc">&#39;8&#39;</span><span class="o">,</span><span class="sc">&#39;8&#39;</span><span class="o">};</span> <span class="c1">// 17 chars</span>
<span class="n">Engine</span> <span class="n">e</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="nf">Engine</span><span class="o">();</span>
<span class="n">Car</span> <span class="n">c</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="nf">Car</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">v</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">e</span><span class="o">);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>I&#39;m not entirely sure about JVM, but in C++ such an object will take
exactly 25 bytes in memory (assuming it&#39;s 64-bit x86 architecture). The
first 17 bytes will be taken by the array of chars and another 8 bytes
by a pointer to the block in memory with object <code>e</code>.
That&#39;s how the C++ compiler understands objects and translates them to
the x86 architecture. In C++, objects are just data structures with
clearly defined allocation of data attributes.</p>

<p>In that example, attributes <code>vin</code> and <code>engine</code> are not equal:
<code>vin</code> is &quot;data&quot;, while <code>engine</code> is a &quot;pointer&quot; to another object.
I intentionally made it this way in order to demonstrate that calling
an object a box with data is possible only with <code>vin</code>. Only when
the data are located right &quot;inside&quot; the object can we say that the
object is actually a box for the data. With <code>engine</code>, it isn&#39;t
really true because there is no data technically <em>inside</em> the object. Instead, there is a
<em>pointer</em> to another object. If our object would only have an
<code>engine</code> attribute, it would take just 8 bytes in memory, with none of them
actually occupied by &quot;data&quot;.</p>

<p>Now, let&#39;s get back to our new pseudo language. Let&#39;s imagine it treats
objects very differently than C++ &mdash; it doesn&#39;t keep object attributes
in memory <em>at all</em>. It doesn&#39;t have pointers, and it doesn&#39;t know anything about
x86 architecture. It just <em>knows</em> somehow what attributes belong to an object.</p>

<p>Thus, in our language, objects are no longer boxes with data both technically
and conceptually. They know where the data is, but they don&#39;t
<em>contain</em> the data. They <em>represent</em> the data, as well as other objects and entities.
Indeed, the object <code>c</code> in our imaginary language represents two other objects:
a VIN and an engine.</p>

<p>To summarize, we have to understand that even though a mechanical
definition of an object is correct in most programming languages on the
market at the moment, it is very incorrect conceptually because it
treats an object as a box with data that are too visible to
the outside world. That visibility provokes us to think <em>procedurally</em>
and try to access that data as much as possible.</p>

<figure class='badge'><a href='http://amzn.to/266oJr4'></a></figure>

<p>If we would think of an object as a <strong>representative</strong> of data instead of
a container of them, we would not want to get ahold of data as soon as
possible. We would understand that the data are far away and we can&#39;t
just easily touch them. We should communicate with an object &mdash; and how
exactly it communicates with the data is not our concern.</p>

<p>I hope that in the near future, the market will introduce new object-oriented
languages that won&#39;t store objects as in-memory data structures, even
technically.</p>

<p>By the way, here is the definition of an object from my favorite book,
<a href="http://amzn.to/266oJr4">Object Thinking</a> by David West, p. 66:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>An object is the equivalent of the quanta from which the universe is constructed</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What do you think? Is it close to the &quot;representative&quot; definition I just
proposed?</p>
