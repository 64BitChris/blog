      <h1>Data Transfer Object Is a Shame</h1>
      <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transfer_object">DTO</a>,
as far as I understand it, is a cornerstone of the ORM design pattern,
which I <a href="/2014/12/01/orm-offensive-anti-pattern.html">simply "adore"</a>.
But let's skip to the point: DTO is just a shame, and the man who invented
it is just wrong. There is no excuse for what he has done.</p>





<p>By the way, his name, to my knowledge, was
<a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/LocalDTO.html">Martin Fowler</a>. Maybe he
was not the sole inventor of DTO, but he made it legal and recommended
its use. With all due respect, he was just wrong.</p>

<p>The key idea of object-oriented programming is to hide data
behind objects. This idea has a name:
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encapsulation_%28computer_programming%29">encapsulation</a>.
In OOP, data
must not be visible. <a href="/2014/11/20/seven-virtues-of-good-object.html">Objects</a>
must only have access to the data they
encapsulate and never to the data encapsulated by other objects. There
can be no arguing about this principle â€” it is what
<a href="/2016/08/15/what-is-wrong-object-oriented-programming.html">OOP</a> is all about.</p>

<p>However, DTO runs completely against that principle.</p>

<p>Let's see a practical example. Say that this is a service that fetches
a JSON document from some RESTful API and returns a DTO, which we can then
store in the database:</p>



<p>I guess this is what will happen inside the <code>loadBookById()</code> method:</p>



<p>Am I right? I bet I am. It already looks disgusting to me. Anyway, let's
continue. This is what will most likely happen in the <code>saveNewBook()</code> method
(I'm using pure JDBC):</p>



<p>This <code>Book</code> is a classic example of a data transfer object design pattern.
All it does is transfer
data between two pieces of code, two procedures. The object <code>book</code> is pretty
dumb. All it knows how to do is ... nothing. It doesn't do anything. It is
actually not an object at all but rather a passive and anemic data structure.</p>

<p>What is the right design? There are a few. For example, this one looks
good to me:</p>



<p>This is what happens in <code>bookById()</code>:</p>



<p>This is what happens in <code>Book.save()</code>:</p>



<p>What happens if there are many more parameters of the book in JSON that won't
fit nicely as parameters into a single <code>createBook()</code> method? How about this:</p>



<p>There are many other options. But the main point is that the data
<strong>never</strong> escapes the object <code>book</code>. Once the object is instantiated, the
data is not visible or accessible by anyone else. We may only
ask our object to save itself or to
<a href="/2016/04/05/printers-instead-of-getters.html">print</a>
itself to some media, but we
will never <a href="/2014/09/16/getters-and-setters-are-evil.html">get</a>
any data from it.</p>

<p>The very idea of DTO is wrong because it turns object-oriented code
into procedural code. We have procedures that manipulate data, and DTO is just
a box for that data. Don't think that way, and don't do that.</p>

<p>PS. Yet another name of DTO is
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_object">business object</a>.</p>
