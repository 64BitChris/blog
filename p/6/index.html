That's absolutely wrong! Well, I do consider them a terrible anti-pattern, but they have nothing to do with functional programming. I believe there are two basic reasons why. First, functional programming is declarative, while utility class methods are imperative. Second, functional programming is based on lambda calculus, where a function can be assigned to a variable. Utility class methods are not functions in this sense. I'll decode these statements in a minute.</p><p>In Java, there are basically two valid alternatives to these ugly utility classes aggressively promoted by <a href="https://code.google.com/p/guava-libraries/">Guava</a>, <a href="http://commons.apache.org/">Apache Commons</a>, and others. The first one is the use of traditional classes, and the second one is <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/lambdaexpressions.html">Java 8 lambda</a>. Now let's see why utility classes are not even close to functional programming and where this misconception is coming from.</p></div><p> <a href="/2015/02/20/utility-classes-vs-functional-programming.html"> continue... </a></p> </section></div><div class="wrapper"> <section class="front"> <header><h1> <a href="/2015/02/16/it-is-not-a-school.html"> It's Not a School! </a></h1><ul class="subline"><li> <time datetime="2015-02-16T00:00:00+00:00"> 16 February 2015 </time></li><li> 1453 words</li><li> 6 minutes to read</li><li> <i class="icon icon-comments"></i> <a href="http://www.yegor256.com/2015/02/16/it-is-not-a-school.html#disqus_thread">comments</a></li></ul> </header><div class="main"><p>At <a href="http://www.teamed.io">teamed.io</a>, we work in distributed teams and keep all our communications <a href="/2014/10/07/stop-chatting-start-coding.html">in tickets</a>.

My usual answer is, "<em>This is not a school; nobody is going to teach you here!</em>" I realize this sounds rather harsh to most developers who are just starting to work with us, so here I'll try to illustrate why such an attitude makes sense and is beneficial to both the programmers and the project.</p><p>Disclaimer: I'm talking about software <strong>projects</strong> here, which PMBOK defines as "<em>temporary</em> endeavors undertaken to create unique products, services, or results".

I hope there is no debate about this. Some do pre-merge code reviews, protecting their master/development branch from accidental mistakes. Others do post-merge <a href="/2014/12/18/independent-technical-reviews.html">regular reviews</a> to discover bugs and inconsistencies after they are introduced by their authors. Some even do both, reviewing before merges and regularly after. Code reviews are very similar to a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White-box_testing">white-box testing</a> technique where a tester looks for defects with full access to the sources of the software. In either case, a code review is a great instrument to increase quality and boost team motivation.</p><p>However, it's not so simple to do them right. I would even say it's very easy and comfortable to do them wrong. Most code reviews and reviewers I've seen make similar mistakes. That's why I decided to summarize the four basic principles of a good reviewer as I see them.

It's a great tool, but it has one important drawback that has motivated the creation of similar tools, like Gradle and SBT. That weakness is its verbosity of configuration. Maven gets all project build parameters from <code>pom.xml</code>, an XML file that can get very long. I've seen POM files of 3,000-plus lines. Taking into account 1) recent DSL buzz and 2) fear of XML, it's only logical that many people don't like Maven because of its <code>pom.xml</code> verbosity.</p><p>But even if you're an XML fan who enjoys its strictness and elegance (like myself), you won't like the necessity to repeat yourself in <code>pom.xml</code> for every project. If you're working on multiple projects, code duplication will be enormous. An average Java web app uses a few dozen standard Maven plugins and almost the same number of pretty common dependencies, like JUnit, Apache Commons, Log4J, Mockito, etc. All of them have their versions and configurations, which have to be specified if you want to keep the project stable and avoid Maven warnings. Thus, once a new version of a plugin is released, you have to go through all <code>pom.xml</code> files in the projects you're working on and update it there. You obviously understand what code duplication means. It's a disaster. However, there is a solution.</p></div><p> <a href="/2015/02/05/jcabi-parent-maven-pom.html"> continue... </a></p> </section></div><div class="wrapper"> <section class="front"> <header><h1> <a href="/2015/02/02/xsl-transformations-in-java.html"> XSL Transformation in Java: An Easy Way </a></h1><ul class="subline"><li> <time datetime="2015-02-02T00:00:00+00:00"> 2 February 2015 </time></li><li> 377 words</li><li> two minutes to read</li><li> <i class="icon icon-comments"></i> <a href="http://www.yegor256.com/2015/02/02/xsl-transformations-in-java.html#disqus_thread">comments</a></li></ul> </header><div class="main"> <figure class='badge'><a href='http://http.jcabi.com'><img src='http://img.jcabi.com/logo-square.svg' style='width:64px' alt='badge'/></a></figure><p><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xslt20/">XSL transformation</a> (XSLT) is a powerful mechanism for converting one XML document into another.
