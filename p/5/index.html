As I do this, I will attempt to convey typical points of view of various project members.</p><p>Basically, there are six key roles in any software team:</p><ul><li>Project Manager — assigns tasks and pays on completion</li><li>System Analyst — documents the product owner's ideas</li><li>Architect — defines how system components interact</li><li>Designer — implements most complex components</li><li>Programmer — implements all components</li><li>Tester — finds and reports bugs</li></ul><p>Everybody, except the project manager, affects the project in two ways: they fix it and they break it at the same time. Let me explain this with a simple example.</p><h2 id=""fix-and-break"">"Fix and Break"</h2><p>Let's assume, for the sake of simplicity, that a project is a simple software tool written by me for a close friend. I created the first draft version 0.0.1 and delivered it to him. For me, the project is done. I've completed the work, and hopefully will never have to return to it again.</p><p>However, the reality of the project is very different. In just a few hours, I receive a call from my friend saying that a he's found a few bugs in the tool. He is asking me to fix them. Now, I can see that the project is not done. In fact, it's broken. It has a few bugs in it, which means a few tasks to complete.</p><p>I'm going to fix the project, by removing the bugs. I implement a new version of the software, name it 0.0.2 and ship it to my friend. Again, I believe my project is finished. It is fixed and should be closed.</p><p>This scenario repeats itself again and again until my friend stops calling me. In other words, until he stops breaking my project.</p><p>It is obvious that the more my friend breaks my project, the higher the quality of the software delivered ultimately at the end. Version 0.0.1 was just a very preliminary version, although I considered it final at the time I released it. In a few months, after I learn of and fix hundreds of bugs, version 3.5.17 will be much more mature and stable.</p><p>This is the result of this "fix and break" approach.</p><figure><img src='http://img.xdsd.org/2014/04/time-and-mess-diagram.jpg' style='width:600px' alt=''/></figure><p>The diagram shows the relation between time and mess in the project. The bugs my friend is reporting to me are breaking the project, increasing its instability (or simply its messiness). New versions I release resolve the bugs and are fixing the project. Your <a href="/2014/04/15/github-guidelines.html">Github</a> commit dynamics should resemble this graph, for example:</p><figure><img src='http://img.xdsd.org/2014/04/jcabi-github-commits-graph.png' style='width:600px' alt=''/></figure><p>When the project starts, its messiness is rather low, and then it starts to grow. The messiness then reaches its peak and starts to go down.</p><h2 id="project-manager">Project Manager</h2><p>The job of a project manager is to do as much as possible to fix the project. He has to use the sponsor's time and money in order to remove all bugs and inconsistencies and return the project back to a "fixed" state.</p><figure><img src='http://img.xdsd.org/2014/04/pulp-fiction-mr-wolf-with-cup.jpg' style='width:600px' alt='Pulp Fiction (1994) by Quentin Tarantino'/><figcaption>Pulp Fiction (1994) by Quentin Tarantino</figcaption></figure><p>When I say "bugs," I mean more than just software errors but also:</p><ul><li>unclear or ambiguous requirements</li><li>features not yet implemented</li><li>functional and non-functional bugs</li><li>lack of test coverage</li><li>unresolved <code>@todo</code> markers</li><li>lack of risk analysis</li><li>etc.</li></ul><p>The project manager gives me tasks that he wants done in order to fix and stabilize the project to return it back to a bug-free state.</p><p>My job, as a member of a software team, is to help him perform the needed fixes and, at the same time, do my best to break the project! In the example with my friend, he was breaking the project constantly by reporting bugs to me. This is how he helped both of us increase the final quality of the product.</p><p>I should do the same and always try to report new bugs when I'm working on some feature. I should <strong>fix and break</strong> at the same time.</p><p>Now let's take a closer look at project roles.</p><h2 id="system-analyst">System Analyst</h2><p>A product owner submits an informal feature request, which usually starts with "it would be nice to have..." I'm a system analyst and my job is to translate owner's English into formal specifications in the SRS, understandable both by programmers and myself. It's not my responsibility to implement the feature.</p><figure><img src='http://img.xdsd.org/2014/04/arizona-dream-two-beers-and-two-shots.jpg' style='width:600px' alt='Arizona Dream (1992) by Emir Kusturica'/><figcaption>Arizona Dream (1992) by Emir Kusturica</figcaption></figure><p>My task is complete when a new version of the SRS is signed by the Change Control Board. I'm an interpreter for the product owners, translating from their language to formal language needed in the SRS document. My only customer is the product owner. As soon as she closes the feature request, I'll be paid.</p><p>Besides feature requests from product owners, I often receive complaints about the quality of the SRS. The document may not be clear enough for some team members. Therefore, it's my job to resolve clarity problems and fix the SRS. These team members are also my customers. When they close their bug reports, I'll be paid.</p><p>In both cases (a feature request or a bug,) I can make changes to the SRS immediately - if I have enough time. However, it's not always possible. I can submit a bug and wait for its resolution; but, I don't want to keep my customers waiting.</p><p>This is where puzzle driven development helps me. Instead of submitting bug reports, I add "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/To_be_announced">TBD</a>" puzzles in the SRS document. The puzzles are informal replacements of normally very strict formal requirements. They satisfy my customer, since they are in plain English, and are understandable by technical people.</p><p>Thus, when I don't have time, I don't wait. I change the SRS using TBDs at points where I can't create a proper and formal description of the requirements or simply don't know what to write exactly.</p><h2 id="architect">Architect</h2><p>Now, I'm the architect, and my task is to implement a requirement, which has been formally specified in the SRS. PM is expecting a working feature from me, which I can deliver only when the architecture is clear and classes have been designed and implemented.</p><figure><img src='http://img.xdsd.org/2014/04/science-of-sleep-time-machine.jpg' style='width:600px' alt='The Science of Sleep (2006) by Michel Gondry'/><figcaption>The Science of Sleep (2006) by Michel Gondry</figcaption></figure><p>Being an architect, I'm responsible for assembling all of the components together and making sure they fit. In most cases, I'm not creating them myself, but I'm telling everybody how they should be created. My work flow of artifacts is the following:</p><div class="graphviz-wrapper"><svg role="img" aria-label="directed graph" width="148pt" height="194pt" viewBox="0.00 0.00 148.00 194.00"><title>directed graph</title> <desc> digraph G { SRS -&gt; UML; UML -&gt; "Source code"; } </desc><g id="graph1" class="graph" transform="scale(1 1) rotate(0) translate(4 190)"><title>G</title> <polygon fill="white" stroke="white" points="-4,5 -4,-190 145,-190 145,5 -4,5"/><g id="node1" class="node"><title>SRS</title> <ellipse fill="none" stroke="black" cx="70" cy="-167" rx="31.1127" ry="18.3848"/> <text text-anchor="middle" x="70" y="-163.4" font-family="Times Roman,serif" font-size="14.00">SRS</text> </g><g id="node3" class="node"><title>UML</title> <ellipse fill="none" stroke="black" cx="70" cy="-93" rx="33.234" ry="18.3848"/> <text text-anchor="middle" x="70" y="-89.4" font-family="Times Roman,serif" font-size="14.00">UML</text> </g><g id="edge2" class="edge"><title>SRS-&gt;UML</title> <path fill="none" stroke="black" d="M70,-148.327C70,-140.264 70,-130.648 70,-121.711"/> <polygon fill="black" stroke="black" points="73.5001,-121.667 70,-111.667 66.5001,-121.667 73.5001,-121.667"/> </g><g id="node5" class="node"><title>Source code</title> <ellipse fill="none" stroke="black" cx="70" cy="-19" rx="70.2092" ry="18.3848"/> <text text-anchor="middle" x="70" y="-15.4" font-family="Times Roman,serif" font-size="14.00">Source code</text> </g><g id="edge4" class="edge"><title>UML-&gt;Source code</title> <path fill="none" stroke="black" d="M70,-74.3267C70,-66.2639 70,-56.6477 70,-47.7115"/> <polygon fill="black" stroke="black" points="73.5001,-47.6673 70,-37.6674 66.5001,-47.6674 73.5001,-47.6673"/> </g> </g> </svg></div><p>I receive requirements from the SRS, produce UML diagrams and explain to designers how to create source code according to my diagrams. I don't really care how source code is implemented. I'm more concerned with the interaction of components and how well the entire architecture satisfies functional and non-functional (!) requirements.</p><p>My task will be closed and paid when the system analyst changes its state to "implemented" in the SRS. The system analyst is my only customer. I have to sell my solution to him. Project manager will close my task and pay me when system analyst changes the status of the functional requirement from "specified" to "implemented".</p><p>The task sounds big, and I have only half an hour. Obviously, puzzle driven development should help me. I will create many tickets and puzzles. For example:</p><ul><li>SRS doesn't explain requirements properly</li><li>Non-functional requirements are not clear</li><li>UML diagrams are not clear enough</li><li>Components are not implemented</li><li>Build is not automated</li><li>Continuous integration is not configured</li><li>Quality of code is not under control</li><li>Performance testing is not automated</li></ul><p>When all of my puzzles are resolved, I can get back to my main task and finish feature implementation. Obviously, this may take a long time - days or even weeks.</p><p>But, the time cost of the main task is less than an hour. What is the point of all this hard work? Well, it's simple; I'll earn my hours from all the bugs reported. From this small half-an-hour task, I will generate many tickets, and every one of them will give me extra cash.</p><h2 id="designer-and-programmer">Designer and Programmer</h2><p>The only real differences between designer and programmer are the complexity of their respective tasks and the hourly rates they receive. Designers usually do more complex and higher level implementations, while programmers implement all low-level details.</p><figure><img src='http://img.xdsd.org/2014/04/pulp-fiction-vincent-and-jules.jpg' style='width:600px' alt='Pulp Fiction (1994) by Quentin Tarantino'/><figcaption>Pulp Fiction (1994) by Quentin Tarantino</figcaption></figure><p>I'm a programmer and my task is to implement a class or method or to fix some functional bug. In most cases, I have only half an hour available. And, most tasks are bigger and require more time than that.</p><p>Puzzle driven development helps me break my task into smaller sub-tasks. I always start with a unit test. In the unit test, I'm trying to reproduce a bug or model the feature. When my test fails, I commit it and determine the amount of time I have left. If I still have time to make it pass — I do it, commit the changes and report to the project manager.</p><p>If I don't have time to implement the fix, I mark pieces of code that don't already have <code>@todo</code> markers, commit them and report to the project manager that I've finished.</p><p>As you see, I'm fixing the code and breaking it at the same time. I'm fixing it with my new unit test, but breaking it with <code>@todo</code> puzzles.</p><p>This is how I help to increase the overall quality of the project - by fixing and breaking at the same time.</p><h2 id="tester">Tester</h2><p>I'm a tester and my primary motivation is to find bugs. This may be contradictory to what you've heard before; but in XDSD, we plan to find a certain amount of bugs at every stage of the project.</p><figure><img src='http://img.xdsd.org/2014/04/fear-and-loathing-adrenochrome.jpg' style='width:600px' alt='Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (1998) by Terry Gilliam'/><figcaption>Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (1998) by Terry Gilliam</figcaption></figure><p>As as a tester, I receive tasks from my project manager. These tasks usually resemble "review feature X and find 10 bugs in it". The project manager needs a certain number of bugs to be found in order to fix the project. From his point of view, the project is fixed when, say, 200 bugs have been found. That's why he asks me to find more.</p><p>Thus, to respond to the request, i find bugs to do my part in regard to the "fixing" part of the bigger picture. At the same time, though, I can find defects on my own and report them. This is the "breaking" part of my mission.</p><p> <a href="/2014/04/12/puzzle-driven-development-by-roles.html"> read on... </a></p><p class="gray small desktop-only"> 1767 words, 7 minutes to read</p> </section></div><div class="wrapper"> <section class="front"><p> <time datetime="2014-04-11T00:00:00+00:00"> 11 April 2014 </time></p> <header><h1> <a href="/2014/04/11/jcabi-http-intro.html"> Fluent Java Http Client </a></h1> </header> <figure class='badge'><a href='http://http.jcabi.com'><img src='http://img.jcabi.com/logo-square.svg' style='width:64px' alt='badge'/></a></figure><p>In the world of Java, there are plenty of HTTP clients from which to choose.

There are <a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/diseconomies-of-scale-and-lines-of-code/">tons of articles</a> written about it, as well as famous books. However, I want to compare two projects in which I have participated recently and discuss some very interesting numbers.</p><h2 id="project-#1:-traditionally-co-located">Project #1: Traditionally Co-located</h2><p>The first project I was apart of was performed by a traditionally co-located group of programmers. There were about 20 of them (I'm not counting managers, analysts, product owners, SCRUM masters, etc.) The project was a web auctioning site with pretty high traffic numbers (over two million page views per day).</p><p>The code base size was about 200k lines, of which 150k was PHP, 35k JavaScript and the remainder CSS, XML, Ruby, and something else. I'm counting only non-empty and non-comment lines of code, using <a href="http://cloc.sourceforge.net/"><code>cloc.pl</code></a>.</p><p>It was a commercial project, so I can't disclose its name.</p><figure><img src='http://img.xdsd.org/2014/04/brazil-crowded-office.jpg' style='width:600px' alt='Brazil (1985) by Terry Gilliam'/><figcaption>Brazil (1985) by Terry Gilliam</figcaption></figure><p>The team was co-located in one office in Europe where everybody was working "from nine 'til five". We had meetings, lunches, desk-to-desk chats and lots of other informal communications. All tasks were tracked in JIRA.</p><h2 id="project-#2:-extremely-distributed">Project #2: Extremely Distributed</h2><p>The second project was an open source Java product, developed by an <a href="http://www.xdsd.org">extremely distributed</a> team of about 15 developers. We didn't have any chats or any other informal communications. We discussed everything in Github issues. The code base was significantly smaller with only about 30k lines, of which about 90% was Java and the rest in XML.</p><figure><img src='http://img.xdsd.org/2014/04/shaolin-temple-jet-li.jpg' style='width:600px' alt='Shaolin Temple (1982) by Chang Hsin Yen'/><figcaption>Shaolin Temple (1982) by Chang Hsin Yen</figcaption></figure><h2 id="maturity-of-development">Maturity of Development</h2><p>Both projects hosted their code bases on Github. Both teams were developing in <a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/FeatureBranch.html">feature branches</a>- even for small fixes.</p><p>Both teams used build automation, continuous integration, pre-flight builds, static analysis and code reviews. This indicates the maturity of the project teams.</p><p>Both projects satisfied the requirements of their users. I'm mentioning this to emphasize that both projects produced valuable and useful lines of code. There was no garbage and almost no <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duplicate_code">code duplication</a>.</p><h2 id="show-me-the-money">Show Me the Money</h2><p>In both projects, my role was called that of lead architect, and I know their economics and financials. Besides that, I had access to both Git repositories, so I can measure how many new lines (or changed lines) were introduced by both teams in, say, a three-month period.</p><p>Now, let's see the numbers.</p><p>The first project (the one that was co-located) was paying approximately €50,000 annually to a good developer, which was about $5,600 per month or $35 per hour. The second one (the extremely distributed project) was paying $20-35 per hour, for completed tasks only according to one of the principles of <a href="http://www.xdsd.org">XDSD</a>.</p><p>The first one, in three months, produced 59k new lines and removed 29k in changes in the <code>master</code> branch, which in totals 88k lines of code. The project resulted in about 10,000 man hours to produce these lines (20 programmers, three months, 170 working hours per month) — which equates to about $350k. Therefore, the project cost a whopping</p><p style="color:red;text-align:center;font-size:2em">$3.98 per line</p><p>The second project, in the same three month period, produced 45k new lines and removed 9k, which comes to 54k in all. To complete this work, we spent only $7k (approximately 350 working hours in 650 tasks). Thus, the project costs merely:</p><p style="color:#008000;text-align:center;font-size:2em">¢13 per line</p><p>This also means that programmers were writing approximately 270 lines per hour or over 2,000 per day. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mythical_Man-Month">The Mythical Man-Month</a> talks about 10 lines per day, which is 200 times less than we saw in our project.</p><p>$350k vs $7k, $3.98 vs ¢13? What do you think?</p><h2 id="how-to-validate-the-numbers?">How to Validate the Numbers?</h2><p>If you're curios, I'm using this script to get the numbers from Git:</p><table class="highlighttable"><tr><td class="linenos"><div class="linenodiv"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">1

Again, I can hear you saying that "line of code" is not a proper metric. But, come on, $0.13 vs. $3.98?

And, despite all the fuss about JSON/YAML, I honestly believe that XML is one of the greatest languages ever invented. Also, I believe that the beauty of XML reveals itself when used in combination with related technologies.</p><p>For example, you can expose your data in XML and render it for the end-user using <a href="http://www.w3.org/Style/XSL/">XSL stylesheet</a>.</p><p>Another example would be when you validate the same data, before rendering, to ensure that the structure is correct. You can do this with the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema11-1/">XSD</a> schema. Alternatively, you can pick specific data elements from the entire document by using <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath/">XPath</a> queries.</p><p>Essentially, these three technologies, XSL, XSD schema and XPath, are what makes XML so powerful.</p><p>However, there can be times when XML falls short. For instance, imagine you have an existing document that needs to be modified just slightly. For example, let's use the following:</p><div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-xml" data-lang="xml"><span class="nt">&lt;accounts&gt;</span>
  [...]
  <span class="nt">&lt;acc</span> <span class="na">id=</span><span class="s">'34'</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;name&gt;</span>Jeffrey<span class="nt">&lt;/name&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;balance&gt;</span>305<span class="nt">&lt;/balance&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;/acc&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;acc</span> <span class="na">id=</span><span class="s">'35'</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;name&gt;</span>Walter<span class="nt">&lt;/name&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;balance&gt;</span>50090<span class="nt">&lt;/balance&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;/acc&gt;</span>
  [...]
<span class="nt">&lt;/accounts&gt;</span></code></pre></div><p>The above code represents a list of accounts. Each account has its own <code>id</code> and several child elements. In our example, we need to find the account belonging to <code>Jeffrey</code> and increase its balance by <code>500</code>. How would we do this?</p><p>Well, there are a few possible solutions:</p><ul><li>SAX-parse the document, change the balance and save the stream;</li><li>DOM-parse it, find the element with XPath, change the value and then print it;</li><li>apply a parametrized XSL stylesheet;</li><li>apply XQuery small script to make changes</li></ul><p>All of these methods have their own drawbacks. However, all of them have one particular problem in common — they are very verbose. With each of the above methods, you need at least a page of code to perform this rather simple operation. Furthermore, if the logic of the operation becomes more complex, the amount of needed code grows much faster than you may expect.</p><p>Simply put, XML lacks a tool for primitive data manipulations within a document. Perhaps, it is this shortcoming that makes XML unpopular with some.</p><p>Anyway, here is a tool I created a few month ago: <a href="http://www.xembly.org">Xembly</a>. It is an imperative language with a few simple directives and resembles <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_language">Assembly</a> in style. Thus, the name - Xembly. With Xembly, there are no loops, conditions or variables - just a sequence of directives with arguments.</p><p> <a href="/2014/04/09/xembly-intro.html"> read on... </a></p><p class="gray small desktop-only"> 677 words, three minutes to read</p> </section></div><div class="wrapper"> <section class="front"><p> <time datetime="2014-04-06T00:00:00+00:00"> 6 April 2014 </time></p> <header><h1> <a href="/2014/04/06/phandom.html"> Phantomjs as an HTML Validator </a></h1> </header> <figure class='badge'><a href='http://www.phandom.org'><img src='http://img.phandom.org/logo-256x256.png' style='width:64px' alt='badge'/></a></figure><p>I created <a href="http://www.phandom.org">phandom.org</a> a few months ago, but yesterday finally found the time to make some needed changes to it.

The PDD method is used widely in XDSD methodology. The method is pending a USPTO patent (application no. <a href="http://www.google.com/patents/US20120023476">12/840,306</a>).</p><p>Let's review the method with an example. Say, for instance, you are a programmer and have been tasked to design and implement a Java class. This is the formal task description: "class <code>DBWriter</code> has to extend <code>java.io.Writer</code> abstract class and save all incoming data into the database".</p><p>You have one hour to implement this task. It is obvious to you that one hour is not enough because the problem is much bigger and requires more work than the slotted time allows. Additionally, there are a numerous unknowns:</p><ul><li>What information do we need to save, and in what format?</li><li>What is the DB schema? Is it an SQL or NoSQL database?</li><li>How to connect to the DB? JDBC? JPA? DAO?</li><li>How to handle exceptions?</li></ul><p>Let's keep all these unknowns in mind as we try to solve the problem on the highest level of abstraction. Of course, we start with a test:</p><div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">org.junit.*</span><span class="o">;</span>

<span class="o">}</span></code></pre></div><p>In the above test, we define the expected behavior of the class. The test fails to compile because there are two missing classes: <code>DataBridge</code> and <code>DBWriter</code>. Let's implement the bridge first:</p><div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">java.io.IOException</span><span class="o">;</span>

<span class="o">}</span></code></pre></div><p>Using the above code, we solve the problem. In the example, we successfully designed, implemented and tested the required <code>DBWriter</code> class. Subsequently, the class can now immediately can be used "as is" by other classes.</p><p>Of course, the implementation is not finished, since we are not writing anything to the database. Furthermore, we still aren't answering the majority of questions asked in the sample scneario. For instance, we still don't know exactly how the database needs to be connected, its type (SQL or NoSQL,) the correct data format and so on. However, we've already made a number of important architectural assumptions, which allowed us to implement the class and make it usable by other classes.</p><p>Now it's time to identify the unknowns in our code and mark them with puzzles. Every puzzle is a request for refinement. We want to ask someone else to help us refine and correct our assumptions.

<span class="o">}</span></code></pre></div><p>This puzzle indicates one of our concerns because we are not sure that the architectural decision is right. Actually, the design is very primitive at the moment and very likely to be incorrect. To refine it and refactor, we require more information from the task specifier.</p><p>The task is finished. Now, you can reintegrate your branch into <code>master</code> and return the ticket to whoever assigned it to you. His task now is to find other people who will be able to resolve the puzzles we just created.</p><p>Every puzzle created now will produce other puzzles, which will be resolved by other people. Consequtly, our simple one-hour task can potentially generate hundreds of other tasks, which may take days or even years to complete. Nevertheless, your goal of working with your specific task is to finish it as soon as possible and reintegrate your branch into <code>master</code>.</p><h2 id="best-practices">Best Practices</h2><p>There are a few simple rules that help you to place puzzles correctly.</p><p>First, you should put your <code>@todo</code> annotations at the point where your code hits a stub. For example, in a unit test. You're implementing a test and it fails because the class has not yet been implemented. You skip the test with the <code>@Ignore</code> annotation and add a <code>@todo</code> puzzle to its Javadoc.</p><p>Second, your puzzle should remain as near as possible to the code element that is hitting the stub. Say thay you have a unit test that has three test methods. All of them fail now because the class has not been implemented. The best approach would be to ignore every one of them and create three (!) puzzles. Each one of the puzzles should explain what you expect from the class and how it should be implemented.</p><p>Third, be as descriptive as possible. Your puzzle will soon be a task definition for someone else. So, explain clearly what you expect the next person to implement, how to do it, which documentation to use and so on and so forth. There should be enough information present that the next person assigned to the puzzles is ables implement your required classes without additional input from you!</p><p>BTW, puzzle collection process can be automated by means of our <a href="https://github.com/teamed/pdd">PDD Ruby gem</a>.</p><p> <a href="/2009/03/04/pdd.html"> read on... </a></p><p class="gray small desktop-only"> 788 words, three minutes to read</p> </section></div><div class="wrapper"><div class="pagination"><div style="float:left"> <a href="/p/4"><i class="ico ico-back"></i></a></div> page 5 of 5<div style="float:right"> <span class="mute"><i class="ico ico-forward"></i></span></div></div></div></body></html>
