There are <a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/diseconomies-of-scale-and-lines-of-code/">tons of articles</a> written about it, as well as famous books. However, I want to compare two projects in which I have participated recently and discuss some very interesting numbers.</p><h2 id="project-#1:-traditionally-co-located">Project #1: Traditionally Co-located</h2><p>The first project I was apart of was performed by a traditionally co-located group of programmers. There were about 20 of them (I'm not counting managers, analysts, product owners, SCRUM masters, etc.) The project was a web auctioning site with pretty high traffic numbers (over two million page views per day).</p><p>The code base size was about 200k lines, of which 150k was PHP, 35k JavaScript and the remainder CSS, XML, Ruby, and something else. I'm counting only non-empty and non-comment lines of code, using <a href="http://cloc.sourceforge.net/"><code>cloc.pl</code></a>.</p><p>It was a commercial project, so I can't disclose its name.</p><figure><img src='http://img.xdsd.org/2014/04/brazil-crowded-office.jpg' style='width:600px' alt='Brazil (1985) by Terry Gilliam'/><figcaption>Brazil (1985) by Terry Gilliam</figcaption></figure><p>The team was co-located in one office in Europe where everybody was working "from nine 'til five". We had meetings, lunches, desk-to-desk chats and lots of other informal communications. All tasks were tracked in JIRA.</p><h2 id="project-#2:-extremely-distributed">Project #2: Extremely Distributed</h2><p>The second project was an open source Java product, developed by an <a href="http://www.xdsd.org">extremely distributed</a> team of about 15 developers. We didn't have any chats or any other informal communications. We discussed everything in Github issues. The code base was significantly smaller with only about 30k lines, of which about 90% was Java and the rest in XML.</p><figure><img src='http://img.xdsd.org/2014/04/shaolin-temple-jet-li.jpg' style='width:600px' alt='Shaolin Temple (1982) by Chang Hsin Yen'/><figcaption>Shaolin Temple (1982) by Chang Hsin Yen</figcaption></figure><h2 id="maturity-of-development">Maturity of Development</h2><p>Both projects hosted their code bases on Github. Both teams were developing in <a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/FeatureBranch.html">feature branches</a>- even for small fixes.</p><p>Both teams used build automation, continuous integration, pre-flight builds, static analysis and code reviews. This indicates the maturity of the project teams.</p><p>Both projects satisfied the requirements of their users. I'm mentioning this to emphasize that both projects produced valuable and useful lines of code. There was no garbage and almost no <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duplicate_code">code duplication</a>.</p><h2 id="show-me-the-money">Show Me the Money</h2><p>In both projects, my role was called that of lead architect, and I know their economics and financials. Besides that, I had access to both Git repositories, so I can measure how many new lines (or changed lines) were introduced by both teams in, say, a three-month period.</p><p>Now, let's see the numbers.</p><p>The first project (the one that was co-located) was paying approximately €50,000 annually to a good developer, which was about $5,600 per month or $35 per hour. The second one (the extremely distributed project) was paying $20-35 per hour, for completed tasks only according to one of the principles of <a href="http://www.xdsd.org">XDSD</a>.</p><p>The first one, in three months, produced 59k new lines and removed 29k in changes in the <code>master</code> branch, which in totals 88k lines of code. The project resulted in about 10,000 man hours to produce these lines (20 programmers, three months, 170 working hours per month) — which equates to about $350k. Therefore, the project cost a whopping</p><p style="color:red;text-align:center;font-size:2em">$3.98 per line</p><p>The second project, in the same three month period, produced 45k new lines and removed 9k, which comes to 54k in all. To complete this work, we spent only $7k (approximately 350 working hours in 650 tasks). Thus, the project costs merely:</p><p style="color:#008000;text-align:center;font-size:2em">¢13 per line</p><p>This also means that programmers were writing approximately 270 lines per hour or over 2,000 per day. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mythical_Man-Month">The Mythical Man-Month</a> talks about 10 lines per day, which is 200 times less than we saw in our project.</p><p>$350k vs $7k, $3.98 vs ¢13? What do you think?</p><h2 id="how-to-validate-the-numbers?">How to Validate the Numbers?</h2><p>If you're curios, I'm using this script to get the numbers from Git:</p><table class="highlighttable"><tr><td class="linenos"><div class="linenodiv"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">1

Again, I can hear you saying that "line of code" is not a proper metric. But, come on, $0.13 vs. $3.98? Thirty times more expensive?</p><figure><img src='http://img.xdsd.org/2014/04/lebowski-they-did-not-receive-the-money.jpg' style='width:600px' alt='The Big Lebowski (1998) by Joel Coen'/><figcaption>The Big Lebowski (1998) by Joel Coen</figcaption></figure><p>It's not about metrics any more.

XDSD is not about that. <a href="http://www.xdsd.org">XDSD</a> is about strict quality principles, which should be followed by the entire team.</p><p>And when these principles are in place — you pay thirty times less.</p><p>By the way, this is what people say about their projects:</p><ul><li>$12–103: <a href="http://www.crazyontap.com/topic.php?TopicId=242135">crazyontap.com</a></li><li>$15–40: <a href="http://betterembsw.blogspot.nl/2010/10/embedded-software-costs-15-40-per-line.html">betterembsw.blogspot.nl</a></li><li>over $5: <a href="http://discuss.joelonsoftware.com/default.asp?biz.5.467536.25">joelonsoftware.com</a></li></ul><p>What are your numbers?

And, despite all the fuss about JSON/YAML, I honestly believe that XML is one of the greatest languages ever invented. Also, I believe that the beauty of XML reveals itself when used in combination with related technologies.</p><p>For example, you can expose your data in XML and render it for the end-user using <a href="http://www.w3.org/Style/XSL/">XSL stylesheet</a>.</p><p>Another example would be when you validate the same data, before rendering, to ensure that the structure is correct. You can do this with the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema11-1/">XSD</a> schema. Alternatively, you can pick specific data elements from the entire document by using <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath/">XPath</a> queries.</p><p>Essentially, these three technologies, XSL, XSD schema and XPath, are what makes XML so powerful.</p><p>However, there can be times when XML falls short. For instance, imagine you have an existing document that needs to be modified just slightly. For example, let's use the following:</p><div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-xml" data-lang="xml"><span class="nt">&lt;accounts&gt;</span>
  [...]
  <span class="nt">&lt;acc</span> <span class="na">id=</span><span class="s">'34'</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;name&gt;</span>Jeffrey<span class="nt">&lt;/name&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;balance&gt;</span>305<span class="nt">&lt;/balance&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;/acc&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;acc</span> <span class="na">id=</span><span class="s">'35'</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;name&gt;</span>Walter<span class="nt">&lt;/name&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;balance&gt;</span>50090<span class="nt">&lt;/balance&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;/acc&gt;</span>
  [...]
<span class="nt">&lt;/accounts&gt;</span></code></pre></div><p>The above code represents a list of accounts. Each account has its own <code>id</code> and several child elements. In our example, we need to find the account belonging to <code>Jeffrey</code> and increase its balance by <code>500</code>. How would we do this?</p><p>Well, there are a few possible solutions:</p><ul><li>SAX-parse the document, change the balance and save the stream;</li><li>DOM-parse it, find the element with XPath, change the value and then print it;</li><li>apply a parametrized XSL stylesheet;</li><li>apply XQuery small script to make changes</li></ul><p>All of these methods have their own drawbacks. However, all of them have one particular problem in common — they are very verbose. With each of the above methods, you need at least a page of code to perform this rather simple operation. Furthermore, if the logic of the operation becomes more complex, the amount of needed code grows much faster than you may expect.</p><p>Simply put, XML lacks a tool for primitive data manipulations within a document. Perhaps, it is this shortcoming that makes XML unpopular with some.</p><p>Anyway, here is a tool I created a few month ago: <a href="http://www.xembly.org">Xembly</a>. It is an imperative language with a few simple directives and resembles <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_language">Assembly</a> in style. Thus, the name - Xembly. With Xembly, there are no loops, conditions or variables - just a sequence of directives with arguments.</p><p> <a href="/2014/04/09/xembly-intro.html"> read on... </a></p><p class="gray small desktop-only"> 677 words, three minutes to read</p> </section></div><div class="wrapper"> <section class="front"><p> <time datetime="2014-04-06T00:00:00+00:00"> 6 April 2014 </time></p> <header><h1> <a href="/2014/04/06/phandom.html"> Phantomjs as an HTML Validator </a></h1> </header> <figure class='badge'><a href='http://www.phandom.org'><img src='http://img.phandom.org/logo-256x256.png' style='width:64px' alt='badge'/></a></figure><p>I created <a href="http://www.phandom.org">phandom.org</a> a few months ago, but yesterday finally found the time to make some needed changes to it.

The PDD method is used widely in XDSD methodology. The method is pending a USPTO patent (application no. <a href="http://www.google.com/patents/US20120023476">12/840,306</a>).</p><p>Let's review the method with an example. Say, for instance, you are a programmer and have been tasked to design and implement a Java class. This is the formal task description: "class <code>DBWriter</code> has to extend <code>java.io.Writer</code> abstract class and save all incoming data into the database".</p><p>You have one hour to implement this task. It is obvious to you that one hour is not enough because the problem is much bigger and requires more work than the slotted time allows. Additionally, there are a numerous unknowns:</p><ul><li>What information do we need to save, and in what format?</li><li>What is the DB schema? Is it an SQL or NoSQL database?</li><li>How to connect to the DB? JDBC? JPA? DAO?</li><li>How to handle exceptions?</li></ul><p>Let's keep all these unknowns in mind as we try to solve the problem on the highest level of abstraction. Of course, we start with a test:</p><div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">org.junit.*</span><span class="o">;</span>

The test fails to compile because there are two missing classes: <code>DataBridge</code> and <code>DBWriter</code>.

<span class="o">}</span></code></pre></div><p>Using the above code, we solve the problem. In the example, we successfully designed, implemented and tested the required <code>DBWriter</code> class. Subsequently, the class can now immediately can be used "as is" by other classes.</p><p>Of course, the implementation is not finished, since we are not writing anything to the database. Furthermore, we still aren't answering the majority of questions asked in the sample scneario. For instance, we still don't know exactly how the database needs to be connected, its type (SQL or NoSQL,) the correct data format and so on. However, we've already made a number of important architectural assumptions, which allowed us to implement the class and make it usable by other classes.</p><p>Now it's time to identify the unknowns in our code and mark them with puzzles. Every puzzle is a request for refinement. We want to ask someone else to help us refine and correct our assumptions. Here is the first puzzle we need to add:</p><div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span class="kd">public</span> <span class="kd">interface</span> <span class="nc">DataBridge</span> <span class="o">{</span>

<span class="o">}</span></code></pre></div><p>The puzzle has three elements: <code>@todo</code> tag, <code>#123</code> locator and a comment. Locator displays the following: "The puzzle was created while working with ticket #123".</p><p>Let’s add one more puzzle:</p><div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span class="kt">void</span> <span class="nf">write</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="kt">char</span><span class="o">[]</span> <span class="n">cbuf</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">off</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">len</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="kd">throws</span> <span class="n">IOException</span> <span class="o">{</span>

<span class="o">}</span></code></pre></div><p>This puzzle indicates one of our concerns because we are not sure that the architectural decision is right. Actually, the design is very primitive at the moment and very likely to be incorrect. To refine it and refactor, we require more information from the task specifier.</p><p>The task is finished. Now, you can reintegrate your branch into <code>master</code> and return the ticket to whoever assigned it to you. His task now is to find other people who will be able to resolve the puzzles we just created.</p><p>Every puzzle created now will produce other puzzles, which will be resolved by other people. Consequtly, our simple one-hour task can potentially generate hundreds of other tasks, which may take days or even years to complete. Nevertheless, your goal of working with your specific task is to finish it as soon as possible and reintegrate your branch into <code>master</code>.</p><h2 id="best-practices">Best Practices</h2><p>There are a few simple rules that help you to place puzzles correctly.</p><p>First, you should put your <code>@todo</code> annotations at the point where your code hits a stub. For example, in a unit test. You're implementing a test and it fails because the class has not yet been implemented. You skip the test with the <code>@Ignore</code> annotation and add a <code>@todo</code> puzzle to its Javadoc.</p><p>Second, your puzzle should remain as near as possible to the code element that is hitting the stub. Say thay you have a unit test that has three test methods. All of them fail now because the class has not been implemented. The best approach would be to ignore every one of them and create three (!) puzzles. Each one of the puzzles should explain what you expect from the class and how it should be implemented.</p><p>Third, be as descriptive as possible. Your puzzle will soon be a task definition for someone else. So, explain clearly what you expect the next person to implement, how to do it, which documentation to use and so on and so forth. There should be enough information present that the next person assigned to the puzzles is ables implement your required classes without additional input from you!</p><p>BTW, puzzle collection process can be automated by means of our <a href="https://github.com/teamed/pdd">PDD Ruby gem</a>.</p><p> <a href="/2009/03/04/pdd.html"> read on... </a></p><p class="gray small desktop-only"> 788 words, three minutes to read</p> </section></div><div class="wrapper"><div class="pagination"><div style="float:left"> <a href="/p/4"><i class="ico ico-back"></i></a></div> page 5 of 5<div style="float:right"> <span class="mute"><i class="ico ico-forward"></i></span></div></div></div></body></html>
