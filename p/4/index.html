To use it, you create a "bucket" there with a unique name and upload your objects.</p><p>Afterwards, AWS guarantees your object will be available for download through their <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/APIRest.html">RESTful API</a>.</p><p>A few years ago, AWS introduced a S3 feature S3 called <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/WebsiteHosting.html">static website hosting</a>.</p><p>With static website hosting, you simply turn on the feature and all objects in your bucket become available through public HTTP. This is an awesome feature for hosting static content, such as images, JavaScript files, video and audio content.</p><p>When using the hosting, you need to change the CNAME record in your DNS so that it points to <code>www.example.com.aws.amazon.com</code>. After changing the DNS entry, your static website is available at <code>www.example.com</code> just as it would be normally.</p><p>When using Amazon S3, though, it is not possible to protect your website because the content is purely static. This means you can't have a login page on the front end. With the service, you can either make your objects either absolutely public — so that anyone can see them online — or assign access rights to them — but only for users connected through RESTful API.</p><p> <a href="/2014/04/21/s3-http-basic-auth.html"> read on... </a></p><p class="gray small desktop-only"> 832 words, four minutes to read</p> </section></div><div class="wrapper"> <section class="front"><p> <time datetime="2014-04-20T00:00:00+00:00"> 20 April 2014 </time></p> <header><h1> <a href="/2014/04/20/how-hourly-rate-is-calculated.html"> How Hourly Rate Is Calculated </a></h1> </header><p>In XDSD, everyone — including project managers, analysts, programmers, and product owners — receives payments based on deliverables with agreed upon budgets. In the fhe first section of the article, <a href="/2014/04/17/how-xdsd-is-different.html">How XDSD Is Different</a> I explain exactly how this concept works. I don't explain in the article, though, how we decide which hourly rate is acceptable for each project participant.</p><p>When new people come to us, usually they have some numbers in mind. They know how much they expect to make per week, per month or per day. We rarely negotiate the payment rates, but rather just accept reasonable offers. Nonetheless, every few months, we review payments rates and change them accordingly (increasing or decreasing them as appropriate).</p><p>Further along in the article, is a list of factors that influence our decision making process regarding payment rates. However, before we get to the factors that influence our rate-setting decisions, it is important to mention that — unlike most other companies or software teams — we don't pay attention to the following:</p><ul><li>Your geographic location;</li><li>Skills and experience listed in your CV;</li><li>Amount of time already spent on our projects;</li><li>Age, sex, nationality, religious beliefs, etc.</li></ul><p>The factors listed below, though, are indeed very important to us. They affect your "overall score" significantly and play a major part in decisions to decrease or increase a payment rate. After changing a payment rate, we don't negotiate it with the project member.</p><p>Keep in mind that besides decreasing your hourly rate, a low overall score may affect the number of tasks you receive from us.</p><p>The best developers receive most of the new tasks. So, continue reading, follow our principles and learn how to earn and enjoy higher rates :)</p><h2 id="fast-delivery">Fast Delivery</h2><p>The faster you deliver on a task, the better. We track all your completed tasks and can calculate easily how many days it takes you, on average, to close tasks. To increase this metric, you should try to close all tasks as soon as possible to reduce your overall completion-time average.</p><p>If you see that a specific task is not suitable for you, don't hold on to it. Instead, inform your project manager as soon as possible that you do not want to work on the task. After you inform the project manager, he will try find you something else more suitable.</p><p>By the way, the best developers usually close their tasks in five calendar days (or less) on average.</p><h2 id="past-due-tasks">Past Due Tasks</h2><p>Though we encourage everyone to reject tasks they don't like, we are strongly against overdue tasks. Once you have started to work on a task, we expect you to finish it on time.</p><p>Our <a href="/2014/04/13/no-obligations-principle.html">No Obligation Principle</a> gives our project managers freedom to take any task away from you if don’t complete it in a reasonable amount of time (ten days).</p><p>Removal of tasks by project managers affects your overall score negatively. Nevertheless, even the best developers sometimes have overdue tasks, and we understand that it happens from time to time. However, our best developers they keep their number of overdue tasks to a minimum. A good rule of thumb for acceptable numbers in this area is about one overdue task per twenty completed successfully and on time.</p><h2 id="complexity">Complexity</h2><p>Every XDSD task has a project role assigned to it. The article, <a href="/2014/04/12/puzzle-driven-development-by-roles.html">Puzzle Driven Development by Roles</a>, lists the key roles we use in XDSD projects. Generally speaking, the higher the role, the higher the complexity of tasks assigned to it. Therefore, closing a task in an "architect" role is much more important than closing one as an "implementer" (or "developer.")</p><p>The more tasks you close in your current role, the faster you will receive promotions and receive pay-rate increases. Very often, our developers work in a few roles at the same time.</p><h2 id="lengthy-discussions">Lengthy Discussions</h2><p>We discourage long conversations on one task. The longer the discussions about a task, the longer it takes to complete — which lowers your quality as a developer. Ideally, developers should receive a task, deliver the result and inform the task author after it's done. Afterwards, the task author closes the task and payment is made.</p><p>We track the number of messages you post and receive in your tasks automatically. Consequently, too many messages may affect your overall score in a negative way.</p><p>To avoid long conversations in tasks, submit new tickets with questions or bug reports. Again, the <a href="/2014/04/12/puzzle-driven-development-by-roles.html">Puzzle Driven Development by Roles</a> article explains the whole idea of helping us "to break the project" by submitting new bugs. Follow this concept and you'll be fine.</p><h2 id="contribution-via-bugs">Contribution via Bugs</h2><p>In XDSD <a href="/2014/04/13/bugs-are-welcome.html">Bugs Are Welcome</a>. You are supposed to report bugs along the normal development activities. Besides receiving extra money for reporting bugs, you can also increase your overall rating.</p><p>The best developers submit one bug for every 2 to 3 tasks they complete.</p><p> <a href="/2014/04/20/how-hourly-rate-is-calculated.html"> read on... </a></p><p class="gray small desktop-only"> 815 words, four minutes to read</p> </section></div><div class="wrapper"> <section class="front"><p> <time datetime="2014-04-18T00:00:00+00:00"> 18 April 2014 </time></p> <header><h1> <a href="/2014/04/18/jcabi-http-server-mocking.html"> Mocking of HTTP Server in Java </a></h1> </header> <figure class='badge'><a href='http://http.jcabi.com'><img src='http://img.jcabi.com/logo-square.svg' style='width:64px' alt='badge'/></a></figure><p>Recently, I explained a <a href="/2014/04/11/jcabi-http-intro.html">fluent Java HTTP client</a> created (mostly) to make HTTP interactions more object-oriented than with other available clients,including: <a href="http://hc.apache.org/httpclient-3.x/">Apache Client</a>, <a href="https://jersey.java.net/documentation/latest/client.html">Jersey Client</a> and plain old <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/net/HttpURLConnection.html"><code>HttpURLConnection</code></a>.</p><p>This client ships in the <a href="http://http.jcabi.com">jcabi-http</a> Maven artifact.

Most XDSD methods are so different (yet critical) that many newcomers get confused. This article should help you bootstrap once you join a project managed with by XDSD principles — either as a developer or a project sponsor.</p><h2 id="we-pay-only-for-closed-tasks">We Pay Only For Closed Tasks</h2><p>Unlike with many other projects, in XDSD, we pay only for closed tasks and the agreed upon time budget. Let me explain by example. Let's say, you are a Ruby programmer and you a get a new task that requires you to fix a broken unit test. The task has a time budget of 30 minutes, as is the case most of the time. Sometimes, though, tasks may have time budgets of fifteen minutes or one hour.</p><p>In our example, we agree upon a contract rate of $50 per hour. With the broken test, you will receive $25 for completing the task — 30 minute tasked billed at $50 per hour.</p><p>It does not matter how long it actually takes you to fix the test. Your actual time spent on the project may be five minutes or five hours. Nevertheless, you will receive compensation for 30 minutes of work only. If you fix the broken test in 5 minutes, you receive $25. If the task takes you an hour, or even a month, to complete, you still receive only $25.</p><p>Furthermore, if you fail to fix the unit test and close the task altogether, you will receive no pay at all for the assignment.</p><p>You can view more details about this principle in the following articles: <a href="/2014/04/13/no-obligations-principle.html">No Obligations Principle</a> or <a href="/2014/04/15/definition-of-done.html">Definition of Done</a>.</p><figure><img src='http://img.xdsd.org/2014/04/revolver-avi-with-dollar.jpg' style='width:600px' alt='Revolver (2005) by Guy Ritchie'/><figcaption>Revolver (2005) by Guy Ritchie</figcaption></figure><p>As mentioned above, this is one of the most important differences between XDSD and other methods. Many people get confused when they see this principle in action, and some leave our projects because of it. They simply are used to being paid by the end of the month — no matter how much work they actually deliver. In XDSD, we consider this type of approach very unfair. We feel that people who deliver more results should receive more cash. Conversely, those who don't deliver should get less.</p><h2 id="we-deliver-unfinished-components">We Deliver Unfinished Components</h2><p>Since most of our tasks are half an hour in size, we encourage developers to deliver unfinished components. Read more about this concept in the article below: <a href="/2014/04/12/puzzle-driven-development-by-roles.html">Puzzle Driven Development</a>.</p><h2 id="no-informal-communications">No Informal Communications</h2><p>Unlike many other projects or teams you may have worked with, XDSD uses no informal communication channels. To clarify, we never use emails, we never chat on Skype and we don't do any meetings or phone calls. Additionally, XDSD maintains no type mailing list. Our only method of communication is a ticket tracking system (which in most projects consists of <a href="/2014/04/15/github-guidelines.html">Github Issues</a>.)</p><p>Moreover, we discourage horizontal communications between developers regarding the scope of individual tasks. When assigned a task, your single and only point of contact (and your only customer) is the task author. You communicate with the author in the ticket to clarify task requirements.</p><p>When the requirements of a task are clear — and you understand them fully — deliver the result to the author and wait for him to close the task. After the author closes the task, the project manager pays you.</p><figure><img src='http://img.xdsd.org/2014/04/goodfellas-paulie-talking.jpg' style='width:600px' alt='Goodfellas (1990) by Martin Scorsese'/><figcaption>Goodfellas (1990) by Martin Scorsese</figcaption></figure><p>We're very strict about this principle — no informal communications. However, it doesn't mean that we are not interested in your opinions and constructive criticism. Rather, we encourage everyone to submit their suggestions and bugs. By the way, we pay for bugs (see the next section for further details about bug reporting and payments.)</p><p>Since we have no formal communications, members of project teams are not required to work at specific times. Instead, team members work at times convenient for them in their time zones. This includes weekdays and weekends.</p><h2 id="we-pay-for-bugs">We Pay For Bugs</h2><p>Unlike many other software teams, XDSD welcomes bug reports in all our projects. Therefore, we ask for bugs openly and expect team members to report them. Review the following article for complete details on XDSD bug reporting: <a href="/2014/04/13/bugs-are-welcome.html">Bugs are welcome</a></p><p>We expect everyone involved with a project to report every bug found. Additionally, we encourage team members to make suggestions. In XDSD, we pay team members for every properly reported bug.</p><p>XDSD makes payments for reported bugs because we believe that the more of them we can find, the higher the quality of the end product. Some new developers are surprised when they receive tasks such as "you must find 10 bugs in class A." Often, the natural reaction is to ask "what if there are no bugs?" However, we believe that any software product may have an unlimited amount of bugs; it is just a matter of expending the time and effort needed to discover them.</p><h2 id="only-pull-request">Only Pull Request</h2><p>We never grant team member access to the <code>master</code> branch — no matter how long you work on a project. Consequently, you must always submit your changes through pull requests (most of our projects are done in <a href="/2014/04/15/github-guidelines.html">Github</a>.)</p><p>We enforce this policy not because we don't trust our developers, but simply because we don't trust anyone :)</p><h2 id="no-compromises-about-code-quality">No Compromises About Code Quality</h2><p>Before merge any changes to the <code>master</code> branch, we check the entire code base with unit tests and static analyzers. Unit testing is a very common component in modern software development, and one by which you should not be surprised. However, the strictness of static analysis is something that often frustrates XDSD newcomers, and we understand that. We pay much more attention to the quality and uniformity of our source code than most of our competing software development teams.</p><p>Even more important is that we never make compromises. If your pull request violates even one rule of the static analyzer, it won't be accepted. And, it doesn't matter how small or innocent that violation may look. This merging process is fully automated and can't be bypassed.</p><p> <a href="/2014/04/17/how-xdsd-is-different.html"> read on... </a></p><p class="gray small desktop-only"> 1010 words, four minutes to read</p> </section></div><div class="wrapper"> <section class="front"><p> <time datetime="2014-04-15T00:00:00+00:00"> 15 April 2014 </time></p> <header><h1> <a href="/2014/04/15/github-guidelines.html"> Github Guidelines </a></h1> </header><p>This manual explains the workflow used when working with a XDSD project hosted on <a href="http://www.github.com">Github.com</a>. You start when a Github issue is assigned to you. Next, you will receive a message from a project manager containing the issue number, title, description and its budget in hours (usually 30 minutes).</p><p>If you don't agree with the budget allotment, don't hesitate to ask for an increase. As soon as you are comfortable with the budget and understand the scope of the work, say so in a reply to the ticket and start working. Be aware that you won't be paid for time spent above and beyond the allotted time budget.</p><h2 id="1.-fork">1. Fork</h2><p>Even though you're part of the development team, you don't have write access to the repository in Github. Consequently, to contribute changes, you should fork the repository to your own Github account (create a private copy of it), make needed changes and then submit them for review using "a pull request."</p><p>After you submit a pull request review, the repository owner approves your changes by merging them into the main repository. This is how we protect the main development stream against accidental damage.</p><p>This article explains how to fork a repository: <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo">fork-a-repo</a></p><p>This one explains how to download and install Github on your computer: <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git">set-up-git</a></p><p>Finally, don't forget to add your private SSH key to Github: <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys">generating-ssh-keys</a></p><h2 id="2.-branch">2. Branch</h2><p>Once you have a forked our repository to your account, clone it to your computer, and then check out the <code>master</code> branch. For example:</p><table class="highlighttable"><tr><td class="linenos"><div class="linenodiv"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">1
2</code></pre></div></td><td class="code"><div class="highlight"><pre>git clone git@github.com:yegor256/jcabi.git
git checkout master</pre></div></td></tr></table><p>Now, it's time to branch (<code>123</code> is the number of the Github issue you're going to work with, and the name of the branch):</p><table class="highlighttable"><tr><td class="linenos"><div class="linenodiv"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">1</code></pre></div></td><td class="code"><div class="highlight"><pre>git checkout -b 123</pre></div></td></tr></table><p>By convention, we use the same names for the branch and issue you're working with.</p><h2 id="3.-changes">3. Changes</h2><p>All task-related questions should be discussed in the Github issue. For Github issues, we don't use emails, Skype, phone calls or meetings. All questions should be asked directly in the Github issues.</p><p>Don't hesitate to submit new issues if something is not clear or you need help. It's a very common to receive a task that you may not be able to implement. Don't panic. This usually happens when you first just join a project and don't yet have enough information. If this happens, don't try to figure out a problem or issue by yourself.</p><p>The rule of thumb for this type of situation is: "if something is not clear, it is our fault, not yours." Therefore, if you don’t understand the project design, it is the fault of the project designer.</p><p>Submit a bug report requesting an explanation of a design concept. You will be paid for this report, and the information you receive in the reply will be shared between all other developers.</p><p>Read this article: <a href="/2014/04/13/bugs-are-welcome.html">Bugs Are Welcome</a>.</p><p>Don't expect anyone to help you. Your only source of help is the source code itself. If the code doesn't explain everything you need to know — it is a bug, which must be reported.</p><h2 id="4.-commit-and-push">4. Commit and Push</h2><p>Make any needed changes using a text editor or IDE. It's a good practice to commit changes as soon as you make them. Don't accumulate large numbers of changes too long before committing them.</p><table class="highlighttable"><tr><td class="linenos"><div class="linenodiv"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">1
2</code></pre></div></td><td class="code"><div class="highlight"><pre>git commit -am <span class="s1">'#123: the description of the changes'</span>
git push origin 123</pre></div></td></tr></table><p>If you have questions about the scope of work, post them in the Github issue and wait for an answer. If you think that the existing code needs improvements, don't hesitate to submit a new issue to Github.</p><p>Don't try to fix all problems in one branch; let other programmers take care of them.</p><h2 id="5.-pull-request">5. Pull Request</h2><p>Create a pull request in Github using the process in the following article: <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests">using-pull-requests</a></p><p>Post its number in the original issue and wait for feedback.</p><h2 id="6.-code-review">6. Code Review</h2><p>After a while, your pull request will be reviewed by someone from the project team. In many cases, you may receive a few negative comments, and you will have to fix any and all issues associated with them. Your pull request won't be merged into <code>master branch</code>, until your changes satisfy the reviewer.</p><p>Be patient with the reviewer, and listen to him carefully. However, don't think that your reviewer is always right. If you think that your changes are valid, insist that someone else review them.</p><h2 id="7.-merge">7. Merge</h2><p>When everything looks good to the reviewer, he will inform our automated merge bot. The automated merge bot will then select your pull request and try to merge it into <code>master</code> branch. For various reasons, this operation fails often. If the merge fails, regardless of the reason, it is your responsibility to make sure that your branch is merged successfully.</p><p>If you can't merge a branch because of failures in tests not associated with your task, don't try to fix them yourself. Instead, report a problem as a new bug and wait for its resolution.</p><p>Remember, until your branch is merged, you are not paid.</p><h2 id="8.-payment">8. Payment</h2><p>Once your changes are merged, return to the Github issue and ask the author to close it. Once the issue is closed by a project manager, you will receive your payment within a few hours, through oDesk or PayPal.</p><p> <a href="/2014/04/15/github-guidelines.html"> read on... </a></p><p class="gray small desktop-only"> 887 words, four minutes to read</p> </section></div><div class="wrapper"> <section class="front"><p> <time datetime="2014-04-15T00:00:00+00:00"> 15 April 2014 </time></p> <header><h1> <a href="/2014/04/15/definition-of-done.html"> Definition Of Done </a></h1> </header><p><a href="https://www.scrum.org/Resources/Scrum-Glossary/Definition-of-Done">Definition of Done (DoD)</a> is a key definition used in Scrum and the one we also use in XDSD.</p><p>DoD is an exit criteria of a simple atomic task and answers the question:"am I done with this task?"

To that end, here are few things that can help you complete tasks and receive payments without too much frustration:</p><ul><li>Don't even start a task unless you're sure you can finish it;</li><li>Ask any and all questions of the task author in advance (before beginning work);</li><li>Don't assume anything — ask if you're not sure;</li><li>Stay after the author to close tasks — be aggressive;</li><li>Don't expect any help from anyone — you're on your own;</li><li>Ask about payment if you don’t receive it automatically after an author closes your task(s)</li></ul><p>It is important to remember that, as a developer, it is your responsibility to ensure that tasks are closed and you receive payment.</p><p> <a href="/2014/04/15/definition-of-done.html"> read on... </a></p><p class="gray small desktop-only"> 300 words, two minutes to read</p> </section></div><div class="wrapper"> <section class="front"><p> <time datetime="2014-04-14T00:00:00+00:00"> 14 April 2014 </time></p> <header><h1> <a href="/2014/04/14/jcabi-dynamo-java-api-of-aws-dynamodb.html"> Object-Oriented DynamoDB API </a></h1> </header> <figure class='badge'><a href='http://dynamo.jcabi.com'><img src='http://img.jcabi.com/logo-square.svg' style='width:64px' alt='badge'/></a></figure><p>I'm a big fan of cloud computing in general and of <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/">Amazon Web Services</a> in particular.

Its design is relatively simple. There are tables, which basically are collections of data structs, or in AWS terminology, "items."</p><p>Every item has a mandatory "hash," an optional "range" and a number of other optional attributes. For instance, take the example table <code>depts</code>:</p><div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">+------+--------+---------------------------+

+------+--------+---------------------------+</code></pre></div><p>For Java, Amazon provides an <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/sdkforjava/">SDK</a>, which mirrors all RESTful calls to Java methods. The SDK works fine, but is designed in a pure <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_programming">procedural</a> style.</p><p>Let's say we want to add a new item to the table above. RESTful call <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/APIReference/API_PutItem.html"><code>putItem</code></a> looks like (in essence):</p><div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">putItem:

I was doing something else"</li><li>"May I take a day off? Tomorrow is my birthday?"</li><li>"May I skip the unit test because I don't know how to fix it?"</li><li>"I don't know how to do it, can someone help me?"</li><li>"I tried, but this doesn't work; what can I do?"</li><li>"This installation requires all of my time. I can't finish the task"</li></ul><p>With excuses, team members transfer responsibility back to the project manager. There was a very famous article <a href="http://hbr.org/1999/11/management-time-whos-got-the-monkey/ar/1">"Management Time: Who's Got the Monkey?"</a> published in the Harvard Business Review about this very subject.</p><p>I recommend that you read it. Its authors present problems as monkeys sitting on our shoulders. When the project manager assigns a task to a programmer — he moves the monkey from his shoulders to the programmer's shoulders.</p><p>The programmer usually presents the excuse "I don't know what to do". Now the monkey is back on the shoulders of the managers. The goal of the manager is to send the monkey back to make it the programmer's problem again.</p><p>One of traditional way of transferring responsibility back to team members is to become an aggressive manager. For instance the manager may say, "You have a birthday tomorrow? I don't care, you still have to meet your deadline" or "You don't know how to fix the unit test? Not my problem, it should be fixed by tomorrow," etc.</p><p>We've all seen multiple examples of that type of aggressive management. Personally, I find this management style extremely annoying and destructive for the project. The project environment becomes very unhealthy and good people usually end up leaving.</p><p>Another traditional management method is micro-management. This results when the project manager checks task statuses every few hours and tells people what to do and how to handle problems. Needless to say, this management style ruins the team and causes good people to leave even faster.</p><p>However, in order to keep the project on track and meet all milestones, responsibility <strong>must be</strong> on the shoulders of the team members. They should be responsible for their own tasks and report back to the project manager when they are finished with their jobs.</p><figure><img src='http://img.xdsd.org/2014/04/big-lebowski-her-life-is-in-your-hands.jpg' style='width:600px' alt='The Big Lebowski (1998) by Joel Coen'/><figcaption>The Big Lebowski (1998) by Joel Coen</figcaption></figure><p>Implementation problems should be solved by team members on their own. So, how do we accomplish this in XDSD?</p><h2 id="i-owe-you-nothing">I Owe You Nothing</h2><p>In XDSD, there is the first fundamental principle that says everybody should be paid for deliverables. Based on this idea, we can go even further and declare a "No Obligations" principle.</p><p>In essence, for every team member, it says: if you don’t like the task assigned to you, don’t have time or you’re simply not in the mood — don't do it.</p><p>You have no obligation to do anything. You're free to reject every second task that a project manager gives to you or even all of them.</p><p>On the other hand, though, the project manager is not obliged to keep a task assigned to you for longer than 10 days (we think that this time frame is logical).</p><p>If you get a task, and don't deliver within ten days, the project manager can take it away and pay you nothing — no matter how much time you invested in the task already or the reasons for your failure to complete it.</p><h2 id="where-are-the-monkeys-now?">Where Are The Monkeys Now?</h2><p>This principle helps us to separate responsibilities between project manager and team members. The manager is responsible for finding the right people and assigning them appropriate tasks. There is a problem with the project manager's management style if he receives too many rejections from the team.</p><p>On the other hand, his team members are responsible for their tasks and should not provide excuses for non-completion. Well, team members can make excuses, but they won't change anything. No matter what their excuses are, the deliverables will be purchased only from members who manage to complete their tasks on time.</p><h2 id="how-does-this-affect-me?">How Does This Affect Me?</h2><p>When you're working with XDSD-inspired project, you should always keep the "No Obligations" principle in mind. You should start a task only if you're sure that you can finish it in a few days. You should pursue your tasks and control deadlines yourself. The project manager will not ask you for status updates, as usually happens with traditional projects. He will just take the task away from you after ten days if you don’t finish it. To avoid that, you should control your tasks and their deadlines.</p><p>With every task, try to be as lazy as possible and cut every corner you can. The smaller the amount of work you perform on a task, the easier it will be to deliver it and pass all quality controls.</p><p>Always remember that your efforts are not appreciated — only the deliverables matter.</p><p> <a href="/2014/04/13/no-obligations-principle.html"> read on... </a></p><p class="gray small desktop-only"> 875 words, four minutes to read</p> </section></div><div class="wrapper"> <section class="front"><p> <time datetime="2014-04-13T00:00:00+00:00"> 13 April 2014 </time></p> <header><h1> <a href="/2014/04/13/bugs-are-welcome.html"> Bugs Are Welcome </a></h1> </header><p>The traditional understanding of a software defect (aka "bug") is that it is something negative and want to avoid in our projects. We want our projects to be "bug-free." Our customers are asking us to develop software that doesn't have bugs. And, we, as users, expect software to work without bugs.</p><figure><img src='http://img.xdsd.org/2014/04/charlie-and-chocolate-factory-chewing-breakfast.jpg' style='width:600px' alt='Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (2005) by Tim Burton'/><figcaption>Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (2005) by Tim Burton</figcaption></figure><p>But, let's take a look at bugs from a different angle. In XDSD, we say that "bugs are welcome." This means we encourage all interested parties to find bugs and report them. We want our team to see bugs as something that we need in our projects. Why?</p><p>Because we understand that there are two categories of bugs: visible and hidden. The more bugs that become visible, the more of them we can fix. More fixed bugs means fewer to annoy our users. By discovering bugs we make them visible.</p><p>This is the primary job of a software tester — to make bugs visible.</p><p>Obviously, their visibility affects the quality of the product in a positive way. This is because we can fix them before our users start complaining.</p><p>In order to motivate all team members to make more bugs visible, we pay for their discovery. In XDSD projects, we are pay 15 minutes for every bug found (no matter who finds them and where.)</p><h2 id="we-plan-bugs">We Plan Bugs</h2><p>We go even further. At XDSD, we plan for a number of hidden bugs in every project. We do this by using our experience with previous projects and expert judgment.</p><p>Let's say we're starting to develop a web system, which is similar to the one we worked on last year. We know that in the previous project our users and team together reported 500 bugs.</p><p>It's logical to assume that the new project will have a similar number of bugs. Thus, our task is to make those 500 bugs visible before they hit the production platform and our users call us to complain about them. Therefore, we're making it one of the project goals: "discover 500 bugs."</p><p>Of course, our estimate may be wrong. Nevertheless, we have historical records for a few dozen projects, and in all of them the number is close to 500. So, finding 500 bugs in a project is usually a reality — we can use it as a target.</p><h2 id="what-is-a-bug?">What Is a Bug?</h2><p>Let us try to define a bug (or software defect) in a non-ambiguous manner. Something can be reported as a bug and subsequently paid for iff:</p><ul><li>it is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducibility">reproducible</a></li><li>it refers to functionality already implemented</li><li>is can be fixed in a reasonable amount of time</li><li>it doesn't duplicate a bug already reported</li></ul><p>Reproducibility of a bug is very important. Consequently, it is the responsibility of a bug reporter to make sure the bug is reproducible. Until it is proven that the bug can be reproduced — it's not a bug for which payment can be made.</p><p>A bug is not a task; it has to refer to an existing functionality. Additionally, an explanation must exist for how and when the existing functionality doesn't work as expected.</p><p> <a href="/2014/04/13/bugs-are-welcome.html"> read on... </a></p><p class="gray small desktop-only"> 530 words, two minutes to read</p> </section></div><div class="wrapper"> <section class="front"><p> <time datetime="2014-04-12T00:00:00+00:00"> 12 April 2014 </time></p> <header><h1> <a href="/2014/04/12/puzzle-driven-development-by-roles.html"> PDD by Roles </a></h1> </header><p>In this post, I'll try to walk you through a project managed with the spirit of Puzzle Driven Development (PDD). As I do this, I will attempt to convey typical points of view of various project members.</p><p>Basically, there are six key roles in any software team:</p><ul><li>Project Manager — assigns tasks and pays on completion</li><li>System Analyst — documents the product owner's ideas</li><li>Architect — defines how system components interact</li><li>Designer — implements most complex components</li><li>Programmer — implements all components</li><li>Tester — finds and reports bugs</li></ul><p>Everybody, except the project manager, affects the project in two ways: they fix it and they break it at the same time. Let me explain this with a simple example.</p><h2 id=""fix-and-break"">"Fix and Break"</h2><p>Let's assume, for the sake of simplicity, that a project is a simple software tool written by me for a close friend. I created the first draft version 0.0.1 and delivered it to him. For me, the project is done. I've completed the work, and hopefully will never have to return to it again.</p><p>However, the reality of the project is very different. In just a few hours, I receive a call from my friend saying that a he's found a few bugs in the tool. He is asking me to fix them. Now, I can see that the project is not done. In fact, it's broken. It has a few bugs in it, which means a few tasks to complete.</p><p>I'm going to fix the project, by removing the bugs. I implement a new version of the software, name it 0.0.2 and ship it to my friend. Again, I believe my project is finished. It is fixed and should be closed.</p><p>This scenario repeats itself again and again until my friend stops calling me. In other words, until he stops breaking my project.</p><p>It is obvious that the more my friend breaks my project, the higher the quality of the software delivered ultimately at the end. Version 0.0.1 was just a very preliminary version, although I considered it final at the time I released it. In a few months, after I learn of and fix hundreds of bugs, version 3.5.17 will be much more mature and stable.</p><p>This is the result of this "fix and break" approach.</p><figure><img src='http://img.xdsd.org/2014/04/time-and-mess-diagram.jpg' style='width:600px' alt=''/></figure><p>The diagram shows the relation between time and mess in the project. The bugs my friend is reporting to me are breaking the project, increasing its instability (or simply its messiness). New versions I release resolve the bugs and are fixing the project. Your <a href="/2014/04/15/github-guidelines.html">Github</a> commit dynamics should resemble this graph, for example:</p><figure><img src='http://img.xdsd.org/2014/04/jcabi-github-commits-graph.png' style='width:600px' alt=''/></figure><p>When the project starts, its messiness is rather low, and then it starts to grow. The messiness then reaches its peak and starts to go down.</p><h2 id="project-manager">Project Manager</h2><p>The job of a project manager is to do as much as possible to fix the project. He has to use the sponsor's time and money in order to remove all bugs and inconsistencies and return the project back to a "fixed" state.</p><figure><img src='http://img.xdsd.org/2014/04/pulp-fiction-mr-wolf-with-cup.jpg' style='width:600px' alt='Pulp Fiction (1994) by Quentin Tarantino'/><figcaption>Pulp Fiction (1994) by Quentin Tarantino</figcaption></figure><p>When I say "bugs," I mean more than just software errors but also:</p><ul><li>unclear or ambiguous requirements</li><li>features not yet implemented</li><li>functional and non-functional bugs</li><li>lack of test coverage</li><li>unresolved <code>@todo</code> markers</li><li>lack of risk analysis</li><li>etc.</li></ul><p>The project manager gives me tasks that he wants done in order to fix and stabilize the project to return it back to a bug-free state.</p><p>My job, as a member of a software team, is to help him perform the needed fixes and, at the same time, do my best to break the project! In the example with my friend, he was breaking the project constantly by reporting bugs to me. This is how he helped both of us increase the final quality of the product.</p><p>I should do the same and always try to report new bugs when I'm working on some feature. I should <strong>fix and break</strong> at the same time.</p><p>Now let's take a closer look at project roles.</p><h2 id="system-analyst">System Analyst</h2><p>A product owner submits an informal feature request, which usually starts with "it would be nice to have..." I'm a system analyst and my job is to translate owner's English into formal specifications in the SRS, understandable both by programmers and myself. It's not my responsibility to implement the feature.</p><figure><img src='http://img.xdsd.org/2014/04/arizona-dream-two-beers-and-two-shots.jpg' style='width:600px' alt='Arizona Dream (1992) by Emir Kusturica'/><figcaption>Arizona Dream (1992) by Emir Kusturica</figcaption></figure><p>My task is complete when a new version of the SRS is signed by the Change Control Board. I'm an interpreter for the product owners, translating from their language to formal language needed in the SRS document. My only customer is the product owner. As soon as she closes the feature request, I'll be paid.</p><p>Besides feature requests from product owners, I often receive complaints about the quality of the SRS. The document may not be clear enough for some team members. Therefore, it's my job to resolve clarity problems and fix the SRS. These team members are also my customers. When they close their bug reports, I'll be paid.</p><p>In both cases (a feature request or a bug,) I can make changes to the SRS immediately - if I have enough time. However, it's not always possible. I can submit a bug and wait for its resolution; but, I don't want to keep my customers waiting.</p><p>This is where puzzle driven development helps me. Instead of submitting bug reports, I add "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/To_be_announced">TBD</a>" puzzles in the SRS document. The puzzles are informal replacements of normally very strict formal requirements. They satisfy my customer, since they are in plain English, and are understandable by technical people.</p><p>Thus, when I don't have time, I don't wait. I change the SRS using TBDs at points where I can't create a proper and formal description of the requirements or simply don't know what to write exactly.</p><h2 id="architect">Architect</h2><p>Now, I'm the architect, and my task is to implement a requirement, which has been formally specified in the SRS. PM is expecting a working feature from me, which I can deliver only when the architecture is clear and classes have been designed and implemented.</p><figure><img src='http://img.xdsd.org/2014/04/science-of-sleep-time-machine.jpg' style='width:600px' alt='The Science of Sleep (2006) by Michel Gondry'/><figcaption>The Science of Sleep (2006) by Michel Gondry</figcaption></figure><p>Being an architect, I'm responsible for assembling all of the components together and making sure they fit.

My work flow of artifacts is the following:</p><div class="graphviz-wrapper"><svg role="img" aria-label="directed graph" width="148pt" height="194pt" viewBox="0.00 0.00 148.00 194.00"><title>directed graph</title> <desc> digraph G { SRS -&gt; UML; UML -&gt; "Source code"; } </desc><g id="graph1" class="graph" transform="scale(1 1) rotate(0) translate(4 190)"><title>G</title> <polygon fill="white" stroke="white" points="-4,5 -4,-190 145,-190 145,5 -4,5"/><g id="node1" class="node"><title>SRS</title> <ellipse fill="none" stroke="black" cx="70" cy="-167" rx="31.1127" ry="18.3848"/> <text text-anchor="middle" x="70" y="-163.4" font-family="Times Roman,serif" font-size="14.00">SRS</text> </g><g id="node3" class="node"><title>UML</title> <ellipse fill="none" stroke="black" cx="70" cy="-93" rx="33.234" ry="18.3848"/> <text text-anchor="middle" x="70" y="-89.4" font-family="Times Roman,serif" font-size="14.00">UML</text> </g><g id="edge2" class="edge"><title>SRS-&gt;UML</title> <path fill="none" stroke="black" d="M70,-148.327C70,-140.264 70,-130.648 70,-121.711"/> <polygon fill="black" stroke="black" points="73.5001,-121.667 70,-111.667 66.5001,-121.667 73.5001,-121.667"/> </g><g id="node5" class="node"><title>Source code</title> <ellipse fill="none" stroke="black" cx="70" cy="-19" rx="70.2092" ry="18.3848"/> <text text-anchor="middle" x="70" y="-15.4" font-family="Times Roman,serif" font-size="14.00">Source code</text> </g><g id="edge4" class="edge"><title>UML-&gt;Source code</title> <path fill="none" stroke="black" d="M70,-74.3267C70,-66.2639 70,-56.6477 70,-47.7115"/> <polygon fill="black" stroke="black" points="73.5001,-47.6673 70,-37.6674 66.5001,-47.6674 73.5001,-47.6673"/> </g> </g> </svg></div><p>I receive requirements from the SRS, produce UML diagrams and explain to designers how to create source code according to my diagrams. I don't really care how source code is implemented. I'm more concerned with the interaction of components and how well the entire architecture satisfies functional and non-functional (!) requirements.</p><p>My task will be closed and paid when the system analyst changes its state to "implemented" in the SRS. The system analyst is my only customer. I have to sell my solution to him. Project manager will close my task and pay me when system analyst changes the status of the functional requirement from "specified" to "implemented".</p><p>The task sounds big, and I have only half an hour. Obviously, puzzle driven development should help me. I will create many tickets and puzzles. For example:</p><ul><li>SRS doesn't explain requirements properly</li><li>Non-functional requirements are not clear</li><li>UML diagrams are not clear enough</li><li>Components are not implemented</li><li>Build is not automated</li><li>Continuous integration is not configured</li><li>Quality of code is not under control</li><li>Performance testing is not automated</li></ul><p>When all of my puzzles are resolved, I can get back to my main task and finish feature implementation. Obviously, this may take a long time - days or even weeks.</p><p>But, the time cost of the main task is less than an hour. What is the point of all this hard work? Well, it's simple; I'll earn my hours from all the bugs reported. From this small half-an-hour task, I will generate many tickets, and every one of them will give me extra cash.</p><h2 id="designer-and-programmer">Designer and Programmer</h2><p>The only real differences between designer and programmer are the complexity of their respective tasks and the hourly rates they receive. Designers usually do more complex and higher level implementations, while programmers implement all low-level details.</p><figure><img src='http://img.xdsd.org/2014/04/pulp-fiction-vincent-and-jules.jpg' style='width:600px' alt='Pulp Fiction (1994) by Quentin Tarantino'/><figcaption>Pulp Fiction (1994) by Quentin Tarantino</figcaption></figure><p>I'm a programmer and my task is to implement a class or method or to fix some functional bug. In most cases, I have only half an hour available. And, most tasks are bigger and require more time than that.</p><p>Puzzle driven development helps me break my task into smaller sub-tasks. I always start with a unit test. In the unit test, I'm trying to reproduce a bug or model the feature. When my test fails, I commit it and determine the amount of time I have left. If I still have time to make it pass — I do it, commit the changes and report to the project manager.</p><p>If I don't have time to implement the fix, I mark pieces of code that don't already have <code>@todo</code> markers, commit them and report to the project manager that I've finished.</p><p>As you see, I'm fixing the code and breaking it at the same time. I'm fixing it with my new unit test, but breaking it with <code>@todo</code> puzzles.</p><p>This is how I help to increase the overall quality of the project - by fixing and breaking at the same time.</p><h2 id="tester">Tester</h2><p>I'm a tester and my primary motivation is to find bugs. This may be contradictory to what you've heard before; but in XDSD, we plan to find a certain amount of bugs at every stage of the project.</p><figure><img src='http://img.xdsd.org/2014/04/fear-and-loathing-adrenochrome.jpg' style='width:600px' alt='Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (1998) by Terry Gilliam'/><figcaption>Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (1998) by Terry Gilliam</figcaption></figure><p>As as a tester, I receive tasks from my project manager. These tasks usually resemble "review feature X and find 10 bugs in it". The project manager needs a certain number of bugs to be found in order to fix the project. From his point of view, the project is fixed when, say, 200 bugs have been found. That's why he asks me to find more.</p><p>Thus, to respond to the request, i find bugs to do my part in regard to the "fixing" part of the bigger picture. At the same time, though, I can find defects on my own and report them. This is the "breaking" part of my mission.</p><p> <a href="/2014/04/12/puzzle-driven-development-by-roles.html"> read on... </a></p><p class="gray small desktop-only"> 1767 words, 7 minutes to read</p> </section></div><div class="wrapper"><div class="pagination"><div style="float:left"> <a href="/p/3"><i class="ico ico-back"></i></a></div> page 4 of 5<div style="float:right"> <a href="/p/5"><i class="ico ico-forward"></i></a></div></div></div></body></html>
