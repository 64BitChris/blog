All three are compound names that consist of more than one word. Even though they look more descriptive than <code>name</code>, <code>length</code>, or <code>email</code>, I would strongly recommend avoiding them. I believe a variable name that is more complex than a noun is a code smell. Why? Because we usually give a variable a compound name when its scope is so big and complex that a simple noun would sound ambiguous.

Most of those comments stated that an immutable object must always behave the same way — that is what immutability is about. What kind of immutability is it, if a method returns different results each time we call it? This is not how well-known immutable classes behave. Take, for example, <code>String</code>, <code>BigInteger</code>, <code>Locale</code>, <code>URI</code>, <code>URL</code>, <code>Inet4Address</code>, <code>UUID</code>, or wrapper classes for primitives, like <code>Double</code> and <code>Integer</code>. Other comments argued against <a href="/2014/11/20/seven-virtues-of-good-object.html">the very definition</a> of an immutable object as a representative of a mutable real-world entity. How could an immutable object represent a mutable entity? Huh?</p><p>I'm very surprised. This post is going to clarify the definition of an immutable object. First, here is a quick answer. How can an immutable object represent a mutable entity? Look at an immutable class, <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/io/File.html"><code>File</code></a>, and its methods, for example <code>length()</code> and <code>delete()</code>. The class is immutable, according to Oracle documentation, and its methods may return different values each time we call them. An object of class <code>File</code>, being perfectly immutable, represents a mutable real-world entity, a file on disk.</p></div><p> <a href="/2014/12/22/immutable-objects-not-dumb.html"> continue... </a></p> </section></div><div class="wrapper"> <section class="front"> <header><h1> <a href="/2014/12/18/independent-technical-reviews.html"> You Do Need Independent Technical Reviews! </a></h1><ul class="subline"><li> <time datetime="2014-12-18T00:00:00+00:00"> 18 December 2014 </time></li><li> 2103 words</li><li> 8 minutes to read</li><li> <i class="icon icon-comments"></i> <a href="http://www.yegor256.com/2014/12/18/independent-technical-reviews.html#disqus_thread">comments</a></li></ul> </header><div class="main"><p>Do you have a team of brilliant and enthusiastic programmers?
