title: "Phantomjs as an HTML Validator"

I've created [phandom.org](http://www.phandom.org) a few months ago,
but yesterday made a few changes to it. So it's a good moment to
explain how I'm using it in unit tests.

First, a few words about [phantomjs](http://phantomjs.org/). It is a
JavaScript interface to WebKit, while WebKit is a web browser, but without
a user interface. WebKit is a C++ library that enables manipulations with
HTML content, through DOM calls. For example, this is a simple JavaScript
code in `example.js`:

{% highlight javascript linenos=table %}
var page = require('webpage').create();
page.open(
  'http://google.com',
  function() {
    console.log('loaded!');
    phantom.exit(0);
  }
);
{% endhighlight %}

We run it from command line:

{% highlight bash linenos=table %}
$ phantomjs example.js
{% endhighlight %}

Phantomjs creates `page` object
(provided by [webpage](https://github.com/ariya/phantomjs/wiki/API-Reference-WebPage)
module inside phantomjs), and asks it to `open()` a web page. The objects
contacts WebKit and transforms this call into DOM instructions. The page will
be loaded, and phantom engine will be terminated on line 6.

WebKit renders a web page together with everything inside it, including CSS,
JavaScript, ActionScript, etc. It is doing it exactly as any web browser would
do.

So far so good, this is a traditional way of using phantomjs. Now, the idea
of [Phandom](http://www.phandom.org) (which stands for "PhantomJS DOM") inside
Java unit tests:

Let's give phantomjs an HTML page and ask him to render it. When ready, we'll
ask to show us how this HTML looks in WebKit's eyes. If we see our desired
elements there &mdash; our page is good enough. For example:

{% highlight java linenos=table %}
import com.rexsl.test.XhtmlMatchers;
import org.hamcrest.MatcherAssert;
import org.phandom.Phandom;
public final class DocumentTest {
  @Test
  public void rendersValidHtml() {
    final Document doc = new Document();
    // This is the method we're testing. It is supposed
    // to return a valid HTML without broken JavaScript
    // and with all required HTML elements.
    final String html = doc.html();
    MatcherAssert.assertThat(
      XhtmlMatchers.xhtml(new Phandom(html).dom()),
      XhtmlMatchers.hasXPath("//p[.='Hello, world!']")
    );
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

Here is what's happening. We're getting an HTML `html` as a `String`
from `doc` object, and then passing it to
[`Phandom`](http://www.phandom.org/apidocs-0.2.1/org/phandom/Phandom.html)
as an argument. Then,
on line 13, we're calling `Phandom.dom()` method in order to get an instance
of class `org.w3c.Document`.

If our HTML contains any broken JavaScript code, method `dom()` will
throw a runtime exception and unit test will fail. If HTML is clean
and WebKit can render it without problems, the test will pass.

I'm using this mechanism in a few projects, and highly recommend it.

Of course, don't forget, that you should have phantomjs installed on your
build machine.
