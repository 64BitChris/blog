This is a first post on this blog. So, it's about nothing. Just
an introduction. The blog will mostly be about software development
ideas. As [about me](/about-me.html) says, I'm passionate about software
quality, and will write solely about it.

Let's see how will this work :)

ps. BTW, I've bought [Cambria font](http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ascender/cambria/)
for this blog, for &euro;98. Seems to be a nice investment into this new venture.
