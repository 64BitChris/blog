This is the first post on my new blog. Therefore, it's not about anything in particular - just
an introduction and my way of saying hello. This blog will be primarily about software development
ideas. As my [About Me](/about-me.html) page says, I'm passionate about software
quality, and will write solely about my ideas and views on it.

Anyway, welcome to my new blog. Together, let's see how this works out! :)

ps. BTW, I purchased the [Cambria font](http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ascender/cambria/)
just for this new blog. It cost, &euro;98. Nevertheless, I think its a good investment for this new venture.
