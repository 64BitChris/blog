Here they come:

 * [NULL References]({% post_url 2014/may/2014-05-13-why-null-is-bad %})

 * [Utility Classes]({% post_url 2014/may/2014-05-05-oop-alternative-to-utility-classes %})

 * [Mutable Objects]({% post_url 2014/jun/2014-06-09-objects-should-be-immutable %})

 * Getters and Setters

 * Singletons

 * Controllers, Managers, Validators

 * Public Static Methods

Avoid them at all cost.
