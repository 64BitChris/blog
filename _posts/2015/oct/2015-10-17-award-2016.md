This is the second year of the
[Software Quality Award](/award.html). The prize
is still the same &mdash; **$4,096**.
The rules were changed a bit. Read on.

<!--more-->

Rules:

 * One person can submit **only one** project.

 * Submissions are accepted until the **September 1, 2016**.

 * Submissions must be sent via email to [me@yegor256.com](mailto:me@yegor256.com).
   All I need is your Github login and repository name; I will check the commit
   history to make sure you're the main contributor to the project.

 * I reserve the right to reject any submission without explanation.

 * All submissions will be published on this page (including rejected ones).

 * Results will be announced **October 15, 2016** on this page and by email.

 * The best project will receive **$4,096**.

 * Final decisions will be made by me and are not negotiable
   (although I may invite other people to help me make the right decision).

  * Winners that received any cash prizes in previous years can't submit again.

Each project must be:

 * Open source (in Github).

 * At least 10,000 lines of code.

 * At least one year old.

 * Object-oriented (that's the only thing I understand).

The best project is selected using this [criteria]({% pst 2015/jun/2015-06-08-deadly-sins-software-project %})).

What doesn't matter:

 * Popularity. Even if nobody is using your
   product, it is still eligible for this award. I don't care about
   popularity; quality is the key.

 * Programming language. I believe that any language, used correctly,
   can be applied to design a high-quality product.

 * Buzz and trends. Even if your project is yet another parser of command
   line arguments, it's still eligible for the award. I don't care about
   your marketing position; quality is all.

By the way, if you want to sponsor this award and increase the bonus,
