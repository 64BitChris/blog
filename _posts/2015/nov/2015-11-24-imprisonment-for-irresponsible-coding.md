  We put those who break our laws to jail. Why don't
  we do the same with those who don't respect

If I drive too fast and I get caught, I may get a ticket. If I drive
under the influence and get caught, I may go to jail. If I turn my
radio up too loud in the middle of the night and my neighbors call the police,
I may get into trouble if I don't stop it. The law basically protects
us from causing trouble with each other. Why don't we have a law
against **irresponsible coding**?

Software is part of my life. It actually **is** my **life**, not just part of it. I stare
at this MacBook for much more time every day than I drive, talk, or listen
to the radio.

Code is the **territory** where I
[interfere]({% pst 2014/oct/2014-10-07-stop-chatting-start-coding %})
with others, and this is where
we may bother each other. Irresponsible coding is precisely how one
of us can really disturb the other. So why don't the **police** protect
me against, say, authors of Apache Hadoop?

They created something that turns part of my life into a nightmare &mdash; much
faster and much more severely than drunk drivers. So, where is
the police? Why aren't they protecting me, for my tax dollars? Why
aren't those Java guys in **jail** yet? :)

We need a law against irresponsible coding!

How about two months of imprisonment for a
