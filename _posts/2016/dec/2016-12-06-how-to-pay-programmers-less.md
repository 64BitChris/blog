To create software, you need programmers. Unfortunately. They are expensive,
lazy, and almost impossible to control. The software they create either works or doesn't, but
you still have to pay them, every month. Of course, it's always better to pay less.
However, sometimes they may figure out they are being
underpaid and quit. How do you prevent that? [Unfortunately]({% pst 2016/jan/2016-01-05-how-to-punish-employees %}),
we can't use violence any more, but there are some other mechanisms. Let me
share.

**Keep salaries secret**.
It's obvious: Don't let them discuss
[salaries]({% pst 2015/jul/2015-07-21-hourly-pay-modern-slavery %}). They must keep this information
secret. Warn them or even sign
[NDAs]({% pst 2015/may/2015-05-04-how-to-protect-business-idea %}) prohibiting any talks about wages, bonuses,
compensation plans, etc. They must feel that this information is toxic and
never even talk to each other about salaries. If they don't know how much
their coworkers are getting, they won't raise salary questions for much longer.

**Give raises randomly**.
There should be no system behind your salary upgrades or
[firing decisions]({% pst 2015/sep/2015-09-16-how-to-fire-someone-right %}). You give
them raises when you feel like it, not when they are being more productive
or effective. Try to make your decisions unpredictable. Unpredictability creates
fear, and this is exactly what you need. They will be afraid of you and will
not complain about being underpaid for a long time.

**No conferences**.
Don't allow them to attend meetups or
conferences. They may meet [recruiters]({% pst 2015/sep/2015-09-29-mayonnaise %}) there
and find out that their salaries are not
[fair enough]({% pst 2014/oct/2014-10-29-how-much-do-you-cost %}). Promote the idea
that conferences are just a waste of time. It's better to organize events in the
[office]({% pst 2016/aug/2016-08-05-distributed-teams-are-higher-quality %}).
They always have to stay together, never free to meet programmers from other companies.
The less they know, the safer you are.

**Spy on them**.
Make sure they all use your email server, computers, servers, and even mobile phones.
Install software that tracks all their messages. Ideally, you should have
a security department watching all of them and regularly informing
you about abnormal or suspicious behavior. Any contact with other
companies should be considered suspicious. Employees must know you're spying on them.
Extra fear is always helpful.

**Make a deal with competitors**.
Contact your major competitors in the region and agree to not head-hunt
their programmers if they don't touch yours. If they reject
this deal, try to recruit a few of their key engineers. Just offer to double
their salaries. You won't really hire them, of course, but this move will definitely shake
your local market, and competitors will be afraid of you. They will agree to never
touch your <del>slaves</del> developers.

**Promote corporate values**.
[Brainwash]({% pst 2015/mar/2015-03-02-team-morale-myths-and-reality %})
them regularly by communicating how great your company is, how big its
mission is, and how important their contribution is. The numbers on their
paychecks will look way less important compared to the multi-billion-dollar
market the team is trying to dominate. They will sacrifice for a while.
For quite a long time, this trick will work.

**Stress them**.
They must not feel relaxed, it's not in your favor. Make sure they
have tight deadlines, complex problems to solve, and enough guilt on
their shoulders. They won't ask for a raise, constantly feeling guilty
for letting you down with project goals. Try to make them responsible
for failures as much as possible.

**Cushion chairs and tennis tables**.
Spend just a little on all those funny office things, and they will
pay you back big time, through the ability to underpay your programmers.
A fancy and professional coffee machine will cost you $1,000 and make
it possible to save $200 to $300 on each programmer monthly. Do the math.
Make yourself a rule that instead of giving someone a raise, it's always
better to buy a new PlayStation for the office. Also, let them bring
their <del>spouses</del> pets to the office&mdash;they will <del>work</del> stay
longer for less money.

**Give them sound titles**.
Call them Vice Presidents, for example VP of Engineering, VP of Technology,
VP of Whatever. Not a big deal for you, but very important for them. The salary
will be much less valuable than the title they can put on their LinkedIn
profiles. If you're running out of Vice Presidents, try
[Senior Architect]({% pst 2014/oct/2014-10-12-who-is-software-architect %}),
Lead Technical Lead, Chief Scientist, etc.

**Help them survive**.
Most programmers are rather stupid when it comes to managing money. They simply don't
know how to buy insurance, how to plan a retirement fund, or even how to
pay taxes. You help them, to your own benefit, of course. They will be
happy to feel safe in your hands, and won't leave you. They won't ask
for a raise, either, because they will feel bad about even starting such a negotiation.
You must be the "parent," and they will be the "kids." It's a good old model.
It works.

**Be a friend**.
This is the last and most powerful technique. You have to be a friend
to your programmers. It's very difficult to negotiate money with a friend&mdash;they
won't be able to do it easily. They will keep working for you for less money
just because you're good friends. How do you become friends? Well, meet their
families, invite them over for dinner at your house, give them birthday
gifts&mdash;all those tricks. They will save you a lot of money.

Did I forget anything?
