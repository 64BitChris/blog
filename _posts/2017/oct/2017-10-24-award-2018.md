This is the forth year of the
[Software Quality Award](/award.html). The prize
is still the same---**$4,096**.
The rules are still the same. Read on.
Previous years are here:
[2015]({% pst 2015/apr/2015-04-16-award %}),
[2016]({% pst 2015/oct/2015-10-17-award-2016 %}),
[2017]({% pst 2016/oct/2016-10-23-award-2017 %}).

Rules:

  * One person can submit only one project.

  * Submissions are accepted until September 1, 2018.

  * I will check the commit history to make sure you're the main contributor to the project.

  * I reserve the right to reject any submission without explanation.

  * All submissions will be published on this page (including rejected ones).

  * Results will be announced October 15, 2018 on this page and by email.

  * The best project will receive $4,096 (I may split this amount among a few projects).

  * Final decisions will be made by me and are not negotiable
    (although I may invite other people to help me make the right decision).

  * Winners that received any cash prizes in previous years can't submit again.

Each project must be:

  * Open source (in GitHub).

  * At least 10,000 lines of code ([`cloc`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cloc) without any arguments).

  * At least one year old.

  * Object-oriented (that's the only thing I understand).

The best project is selected using this [criteria]({% pst 2015/jun/2015-06-08-deadly-sins-software-project %}).

What doesn't matter:

  * Popularity. Even if nobody is using your
    product, it is still eligible for this award. I don't care about
    popularity; quality is the key.

  * Programming language. I believe that any language, used correctly,
    can be applied to design a high-quality product.

  * Buzz and trends. Even if your project is yet another parser of command
    line arguments, it's still eligible for the award. I don't care about
    your marketing position; quality is all.

By the way, if you want to sponsor this award and increase the bonus,
