You definitely know that [SOLID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID_%28object-oriented_design%29)
acronym. It stands for five principles
of object-oriented programming, which, if followed, are supposed to
make your code both [legible and extensible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID_%28object-oriented_design%29).
I've been taught so, by many OOP books. But let me ask you, honestly,
do these five principles really make sense to you? And, what is more important,
do you apply them to your code? Or, maybe you don't, but you know how to do it?
Unfortunately, I don't think I do.

Let's go one by one.

**S** stands for [Single Responsibility Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle),
which, according to [Clean Code](http://amzn.to/2m7LmaA) by
[Robert Martin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Cecil_Martin), means that
"a class should have only one reason to change." The book explains

literally means that "every module or class should have responsibility over a single part
of the functionality provided by the software, and that responsibility should
be entirely encapsulated by the class." Sounds interesting, but what is
that "functionality"?
