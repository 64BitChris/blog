[Ringlemann Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ringelmann_effect)
basically is about us people **loosing** productivity
when working in groups. We're basically more productive when
working individually achiving personal goals, instead of being
teamed up. That was discovered by Prof. [Max Ringlemann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Ringelmann) a hundred
years ago, in 1913. Today, in my workshop in Berlin, at
[DATFlock 2015](http://distributed-agile-teams.org/workshops/), we tried
to reproduce that experiment. It seems that French professor was right.

Here is what we did. We created two groups with 4 people in each of them.
All non-native English speakers. Then, both groups received the same
task &mdash; to create as many words as possible using letters in a given word.
It's a pretty simple task, which just needs some time and creativity.

The first group was working as a team. They had just one piece of paper
and one pen to write down the words they found. We called them a
**co-located** team.

The second group of four people were working in a **distributed** mode &mdash;
they had four pieces of paper and four pens. They didn't communicate to
each other and were just creating words. They knew that the best performer
would get a prize (it was a bar of organic chocolate).

I promised a prize to the co-located team too. A very similar chocolate bar.

We gave them just 5 minutes.

Our result was this: **38 words** found by a co-located team and **41 words**
found by a distributed team. Of course, we removed duplicates and non-English
words.

Distributed team was **8%** more productive than a co-located one.

Of course, this may be not a clear experiment and we can't use these numbers
to really prove anything, but it was interesting to see how groups work and what
actually motivate us to achieve results. We had an hour-long discussion afterwords,
trying to find out what each of group member felt while working in a group
or individually.

You can try to repeat this (or a similar experiment) in your team and check
the results. Post them below in comments, would be interesting to see whether
it does or doesn't work in your case.
