Ringlemann Effect basically is about us people loosing motivation
when working in groups. We're basically more productive when
working individually and for personal goals, instead of being
teamed up. That was discovered by Prof. Max Ringlemann a hundred
years ago, in 1913. Today, in my workshop at
[DATFlock 2015](http://distributed-agile-teams.org/workshops/) in Berlin we tried
to reproduce that experiment. It seems that French professor was right.
