project manager provokes conflicts and make sure none of them end

Have you ever heard the term "win-win"? Do you know what it means? I'm sure
most of my readers are not aware exactly what this is about, even though
it's being used very often. Let me to explain. In any conflict
there are three possible exists: win-lose, lose-lose, and win-win.
The first one is the worst and the last one is the best. Here is an example.

Say, your wife wants to watch a movie and you want to watch a
baseball game. It's a conflict. It starts with a confrontation of positions.
Your position is "I want to watch this game," while her position is
"I want this movie."
