"What are you doing now?"&mdash;when you hear this question
from your boss, be aware: you're dealing with a
[micromanager]({% pst 2015/sep/2015-09-22-micromanagement %}).
Keeping us busy is the key objective of these creatures and this
is what makes them so annoying. To the contrary, effective managers
make sure we are _productive_, meaning that our results satisfy
their expectations. They are not interested to know what we are
doing to deliver them. They manage the project, instead of managing us.
And the best way to make the project manageable is to break its
scope to small and manageable pieces.

Imagine, you want to redesign your appartment and have a few thousand
dollars for this job. You hire a group of people and give them all your
money. They ask you to come back in two months, when everything will
be ready. You say "OK" and wait for two months. I'm sure you already know
what I'm getting at&mdash;this project most probably will be a failure, to
some extend. In the worst case you won't see these guys ever, they will just
steal your money. In the best case, they will do something that will
look nice.

## Why do we micromanage?

What do you do in order to increase chances to get the best case scenario?
That's right, you micromanage them: you visit them every day, you ask them
the famous "What are you doing now?" question, you push them when they are
getting lazy, you control, you dominate, you annoy, you
"stay on top," you play the guilt card when they miss or forget
anything, you [punish]({% pst 2016/jan/2016-01-05-how-to-punish-employees %})
them every way you can.

You don't do that because you're evil. You just know that otherwise they
will redesign your appartment forever, will forget things, will miss
something, will make mistakes, will spend more money than they are
supposed to, will choose wrong fabrics, will purchase the furniture
you don't like, and will do many other things you're well aware of if you
ever dealt with interior designers and house builders.

The more aggressive you are, the higher the chances to win.

And it's not because you are evil. You're not evil, you're stupid
(not you personally, my dear and respected reader, but you get the point).

The problem is that the project is not manageable. That's why you will
have to resort to the last possible measure&mdash;micromanagement. Why the
project is not manageable? Because its scope is not broken down into
pieces. It contains a single job: "Redesign the Apartment."

One of the key factors of managability is the famous 0/100 rule, which
requires any task to be either "in progress" or "complete." There could be
nothing in the middle. When such a rule is in place, the task can be
delegated to its performer and they can become responsible for its completion,
they can be trusted.

We can't "trust" our single trust to the performer, simply because it's too
big to be trusted. If they fail, the cost of failure will be too high. We have
to take a _micro-scope_ and go _into_ the task to manage it from the inside,
annoying its performers, who we are supposed to trust. The micromanagement
we will do is _inevitable_, because the scope is not broken down.

Scope decomposition was invented mostly in order to solve this very problem:
to make the project more manageable. We need small tasks in the scope in order
to be able to delegate them and never go inside in order to check what's going on
there, who is doing what, why, and where.

The smaller the tasks we can break the scope into, the better.

## Obstacles

In our projects we break project scope to tasks of 30 minutes each.
This may sound too extreme for you, but it works. We call them micro-tasks.
We started to practice microtasking about six years ago. Initially, we were
using different task budgets, from 10 hours to 15 minutes. Eventually we
came down to 30 minutes.

If you decide to do the same, you will most likely have the same or similar
issues and obstacles. Here is a short list of them and my advice.

  * **DoD**.
  Definition of Done, exit criteria, requirements, expectations, etc.&mdash;there
  are many names of this problem, which is related to our inability to define
  what exactly we expect project members to do. Software development
  by definition anticipats a lot of

  * budget

  * what to do with failures?

  * laziness



more focus

clearer goal

money motive works

isolation of dependencies

less time wasted

better parallelism, higher speed in parallel development

personal responsibility

possible to pay per result

necessity to define scope makes it cleaner

easier to apply quality standards

success and failure are easier to observe and reward or punish

delegate and trust is possible

no algorithms, only objectives and exit criteria

DoD is easier
