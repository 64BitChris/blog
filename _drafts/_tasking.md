"What are you doing now?"&mdash;when you hear this question
from your boss, be aware: you're dealing with a
[micromanager]({% pst 2015/sep/2015-09-22-micromanagement %}).
Keeping us busy is the key objective of these creatures and this
is what makes them so annoying. To the contrary, effective managers
make sure we are _productive_, meaning that our results satisfy
their expectations. They are not interested to know what we are
doing to deliver them. They manage the project, instead of managing us.
And the best way to make the project manageable is to break its
scope to small and manageable pieces.

Imagine, you want to redesign your appartment and have a few thousand
dollars for this job. You hire a group of people and give them all your
money. They ask you to come back in two months, when everything will
be ready. You say "OK" and wait for two months. I'm sure you already know
what I'm getting at&mdash;this project most probably will be a failure, to
some extend. In the worst case you won't see these guys ever, they will just
steal your money. In the best case, they will do something that will
look nice.

What do you do in order to increase chances to get the best case scenario?
That's right, you micromanage them: you visit them every day, you ask them
the famous "What are you doing now" question, you push them when they are
getting lazy, you control, you dominate, you annoy, you
"stay on top," you play the guilt card when they miss or forget
something, you [punish]({% pst 2016/jan/2016-01-05-how-to-punish-employees %})
them every way you can.

You don't do that because you're evil. You just know that otherwise they
will redesign your appartment forever, because some other micromanager who
they promised another redesign will always catch their attention more.

The more aggressive you are, the higher the chances to win.
