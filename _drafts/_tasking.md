"What are you doing now?"&mdash;when you hear this question
from your boss, be aware: you're dealing with a
[micromanager]({% pst 2015/sep/2015-09-22-micromanagement %}).
Keeping us busy is the key objective of these creatures and this
is what makes them so annoying. To the contrary, effective managers
make sure we are effective, meaning that our results satisfy
their expectations. They are not interested to know what we are
doing to deliver them. They manage the project, instead of managing us.
The best way to make the project manageable is micro-tasking.
