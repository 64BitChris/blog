A friend of mine asked me today &mdash; how should I fire
someone in a right way? What are the tricks to make it nicely,
gracefully, and professionally? I said that if you question yourself
how to make it right, you're doing it very wrong in the first place.
If firing is a painful and unpleasant process for you, there is
a problem in your management model. Firing must be an **easy**
and **open** procedure, **visible** and **understood** by the entire team.

I mentioned this problem before, in
[the post]({% pst 2015/mar/2015-03-02-team-morale-myths-and-reality %}) about team morale.
I said that firing someone should not be done behind **closed doors**.
Instead, the assessment of individual performance should
happen openly and be visible to the entire team. If you need to close
the door in order to talk "privately", to express your concerns and
to fire someone eventually &mdash; you are a bad manager.

I also explained [some time ago]({% pst 2015/jan/2015-01-26-happy-boss-false-objective %})
that a perfectly managed team is working for the project, not for you, the boss.
The team must share the same goal and work towards it. The boss (or CEO,
CTO, project manager, Scrum master, team lead, etc) is there in order
to enforce the **rules** accepted by the team. The team agrees with the rules
and the boss is just making sure they are **enforced**.

If firing is unpleasant for you &mdash; the rules are not clear.

If the rules are not clear &mdash; you're a bad manager.

The firing is unpleasant only when your decision is not supported by the team.
You feel that you're doing something wrong, to the person you are firing and
to the people who stay in the team. You feel it only because you don't have
enough support from your team. You're acting as a dictator, not a true leader.

The firing decision should not be your decision. It should be derived
from the rules your team agreed to work with. You should not fire when
you don't like the person. Instead, you should fire when the person doesn't
comply with the rules, for example due to the lack of performance.

When the rules are clear, everybody understands them, reconciliation of
performance is done regularly and openly &mdash; everybody will understand
your firing decision and will support it. Including the person you're firing!
Because it won't be your decision, but a decision logically derived
from the rules. You will work for the project, no for your emotions or
personal feelings.

By firing a person who is causing problems for the project,
you will do a good thing for everybody &mdash; the project, the team and the
person who will go and find another place for his or her skills and talents.

Let me re-iterate &mdash; if firing is unpleasant, there is a problem
with the manager and the management.
