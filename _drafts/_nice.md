  Is it safe for a business person to be nice? It is
  possible to do business and be soft-hearted at the same
  time? I doubt, but I have a solution.

I stumbled upon this [_Why It's Safe for Founders to Be Nice_](http://www.paulgraham.com/safe.html)
two years old article by [Paul Graham](https://twitter.com/paulg)
(a co-founder or [Y Combinator](http://www.ycombinator.com/)), whom I honestly respect,
and decided to explain why I disagree. Not that I think that we shouldn't
be nice. Not at all. But I do think that "being nice" is not a solution for organizational,
management, marketing, sales, or business development problems. Moreover,
in most cases it is actually _not safe_ for founders to be nice.

Graham in his article quotes a founder, who explains
his worries about being "fundamentally soft-hearted and tended to give
away too much for free." Then he suggests not to worry too
much, because "as long as you built something good enough to spread by word of mouth,
you'd have a hyperlinear growth curve." In other words, don't worry about
your _softness_ and focus on building a great product&mdash;your efforts
will be appreciated. Will this really work in the modern world?

It will, provided you're a talented mathematician, or a composer, or
maybe a writer, when your success doesn't really depend on people close to you, like
employees, partners, and investors. However, developing a business is
a different story, where success mostly depends on your ability to
generate _profit_, which, by definition, is "taking more and returning less."
What kind of a soft heart will be happy to do that?

[_7 Soft Hearted Mistakes Startup Founders Make_](http://foolishnessfile.com/soft-hearted-mistakes/)
perfectly summarizes how softness may become a weakness,
if we fail to take it under control. In a nutshell,
we are either soft-hearted or successful.
This "weakness" is affective more people every year, since the entire
world, especially its [male part](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/thinking-man/millennial-men-have-gone-soft--but-its-not-our-fault/),
tends to soften, mostly thanks to the rapidly growing quality of life.

For some of us, who, like that founder, are "fundamentally soft-hearted,"
doing business and generating profit is a very stressful activity.
We have to do what goes against our inner self and take advantage of others.
Telling us that there is perfectly safe to "be nice" in this situation
is not ethical&mdash;this disarms us and makes vulnerable in front of those
who don't have the "decease of soft-heartedness."
Is there a better recipe out there to heal our illness?

Even though I'm trying to think of myself as not a weak person,
I have plenty of soft-heartedness decease symptoms. For example, I feel
guilty when:

  * I fire an employee
  * I negotiate someone down
  * I punish someone
  * I don't pick up the phone
  * I say "No" to an offer
  * I don't trust
  * I break up with a girl
  * I don't return my mom's call

Any successful business person, including Paul Graham, who deals with hundreds
of startups every year, would tell you that in order to achieve something
you have to make many steps that will make _unhappy_ many people around you.
You have to fire, to say "No," to punish, to never return phone calls, and
rarely trust. But we're "fundamentally soft-hearted" and simply
can't do that every day&mdash;it's too stressful for us. However, we also
want to be business successfull! We don't want to be mathematicians, or
composers, or just Java programmers. We want to move up in business.
What do we do?

Let me share the recipe I found for myself.

Obviously, we develop soft-heartedness when we grow up, mostly
under the influence of our parents. As kids we quickly learn that in
order to survive and have something to eat we must make those grown-ups
happy, or at least not disappoint them. Later, we call this
[guilt-driven behaviour](https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevenberglas/2012/06/07/6-signs-you-are-suffering-from-guilt-and-probably-dont-know-it/#2920e0b67a24)
"soft heart" and become [proud of it](http://www.lifehack.org/articles/communication/8-problems-you-face-when-you-have-soft-heart.html).
I believe, it's unfixable. Those who were traumatized by guilt in their childhood
will never be able to offend somebody and walk away without any negative
feelings. They are scarred forever.

The only possible way to get rid of guilt is to replace it with a bigger one.
For example, you just bought two icecream cups and a friend asks you to give him one.
You can't say "No" because you would feel guilty for making him unhappy.
But you remember that your mom told you to buy two cups and
bring both of them home. You feel even bigger guilt if you make your mom
unhappy. So, you say "No" to your friend and run home. Of course, you can't
eat the icecream, even though you want it&mdash;you are afraid to make
your mother unhappy.

The same principle may be applied to business. But instead of a controlling
parent you can define your own "rules of doing business." That rules will
be stronger than any particular situation you're facing at any particular moment.
For example, you can decide when and why you answer your emails and phone calls,
what [should happen]({% pst 2015/sep/2015-09-16-how-to-fire-someone-right %})
for your employee to be discharged, how exactly you
[punish]({% pst 2016/jan/2016-01-05-how-to-punish-employees %})
your employees, how your relationship with partners are
[structured]({% pst 2016/may/2016-05-17-convertible-notes %}), etc.
This document or a set of documents will be more important for you than
any particular person or a situation. You will feel much bigger guilt of
disobeying the rules than of making someone unhappy.

At least this is what works for me. Call it self-discipline or a systematic
approach to doing business, but in reality it's just a counter measure against
guilt.

To summarize, answering the question wether it is safe for a business person
to be nice, I would answer that it is very unsafe. But not being nice is not
a solution either, because it's not possible to be not nice for someone who
is asking that question. Thus, the only solution I managed to find is a personal
code of conduct, which helps me be effective and not stressed at the same time.
