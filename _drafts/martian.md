  Why they are doing this?

I've seen [The Martian](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3659388/)
this weekend and it triggered a few thoughts. Of course I didn't like
the movie as a piece of art. It is a total garbage, but this is not the point.
There is something bigger to discuss, aside from bad acting, primitive
storyline, politically correct but absolutely unrealistic casting,
and tons of logical inconsistencies. It's Hollywood, what
would I expect, right? Not just that. I think, the problem is bigger.

Has any of you seen this movie: [Cossacks of the Kuban](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0041562/)?
It was shot in 1949, when [Joseph Stalin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stalin)
was in power, when [Soviet Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union)
was literally broke after then [WWII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II)
and when people were **starving**.
However, the film was showing something completely opposite &mdash;
wealthy villages, rich peasants, tables full of food.

It was [propaganda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propaganda), in 1949.

But isn't it very similar to what I've just seen a few days ago,
produced and directed in 2015 by [Ridley Scott](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000631/)?

In 1949, the goal of Soviet propaganda was to convience people that
their personal situations with the lack of food and lack of future is
just their local personal **exceptions** from a more generic rule. And that
rule is that the country is full of food. The country is governed by
the principles of socialism and they work perfectly.

In 2015, the goal of Hollywood propaganda is to convience us that
organizational and motivational problems in our offices are just local exceptions from
a general rule. The rule is simple &mdash; project management is not important
if we're all good friends.

Ridley Scott is telling us that in a perfect organization, such as
[NASA](https://www.nasa.gov/),
everybody **loves** everyone, that's why they can get a man from Mars, without
even a map. Do the same in your company and you will be fine. You don't
need a risk planning, you just need a hero. Nope, you better need
a couple of heros and they should love each other.

It doesn't work for you? It's just a problem with implemenation.
Keep trying and smiling.

Make friends, don't make plans.

It is a lie, very similar to the lie we've heard in 1949.

The truth is that you are not going to get anywhere if you follow
the spirit of this movie. In reality, team work looks and must look completely
different. There are conflicts, fights, politics, betrayals, back-stabbing,
leakage of information, and just primitive incompetence. To manage all
this one can't just be a **nice guy** with a big heart. I would even say
that being a nice guy is a drawback at any management position in a modern
organization. Well, in any organization, at any time and in any place.

Project management is [not]({% pst 2015/mar/2015-03-02-team-morale-myths-and-reality %})
about compassion and sympathy. It is about
accurate and routine comparison of risks, probabilities, impacts and
their mitigation plans. And about
[setting rules]({% pst 2015/sep/2015-09-22-micromanagement %})
and making **decisions**. And about making sure
these decisions are being executed, precisely and without mistakes.
And [making sure]({% pst 2015/sep/2015-09-16-how-to-fire-someone-right %})
those who made mistakes are **punished**, while those who
did everything right are **awared**.

A team of six. In a multi-million dollar space ship.
Flying to another planet to save one person.
Against explicit instructions from the upper management.
They come back as national heros.
Are you serious?

Have you tried to deploy a new feature to a production server against
the direct will of your boss? Try it. No space ships, no Mars. Just
a piece of code and a simple server. Then try to convience your boss
that you're a hero.

I'm sure you got the point.

So, why Ridley Scott is lying to us?
Why he is giving a false picture of reality.
Intentionally false. He knows better than me how real management
works in real-life organizations. Hollywood is not much different
from Silicon Valley, in this aspect. So, why he is lying?

Why [Joseph Goebbels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Goebbels),
a minister of propaganda in the Third Reich,
was lying to German people?

Because that's what we like to hear.

We don't want to know the truth. We didn't want to know about
Nazi war crimes &mdash; Joseph Goebbels was building a fake reality for us.
We don't want to know about true principles of management &mdash;
Ridley Scott is building fake ones for us.

Think about it.
