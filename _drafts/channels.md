Each software team organizes its communications in its own
specific way. Some use Slack, JIRA or GitHub; others just sit together
in the same room. There are many methods and tools. I believe that
it's possible to rank them by the amount of damage they cause
to your project. This is the list of all of them I'm aware at the moment.

The damage is caused mostly by the distance between these communication
channels and project artifacts. The further away people stay from documents,
the bigger the risk of losing information. And lost information is the first
source of trouble in any project.

  * **Coffee Breaks**.
    This is the most dangerous thing &mdash; you can never
    keep track of them, you won't know what they were about and there
    is no "search" button anywhere. Everything you say standing next
    to that coffee machine will be lost. Nothing will be converted
    to project artifacts.

  * **Phone Calls**.
    A bit better than coffee breaks, but still a big issue. Phone calls
    are completely untraceable. Information you
    exchange on that calls is gone forever. Well, you can record them,
    but searching through phone call records is a tough task, which nobody will
    do, ever.

  * **Meetings**.
    This is the next step after coffee breaks, because there is some structure
    and minutes. Meetings can be recorded (both on and off line), their results filed somewhere
    and decisions documented. In reality, none of that will actually happen.
    Meetings will just kill your time and your sponsor's money.

  **Emails**.
    If you can put some formality into emails and discipline all participants,
    your email history may be considered a project artifact by itself. How
    organized and easily browseable will that artifact be? That's a question.
    In most cases it will just a mess.

  **Mailing Lists**.
    They are better than emails, since some software is archiving them,
    making available and browseable. It will be difficult to find where
    exactly what topic was discussed, where decisions were made and why,
    who suggested what, etc.

  **Slack**.
    There are many other alternatives, which are basically online chats.
    The main problem with all of them is that it's difficult to categorize
    such a chat, group messages, or find something later. It's just a flow
    of information, which becomes useless just a few days after. Of course,
    if you really want to find something there, it's possible. But the quality
    of such a "document" is very low.

  **JIRA**.
    I mean any task/ticket tracking system &mdash; they are great instruments
    to immediately turn conversations and discussions into project artifacts.
    You don't need to document anything, it's already there.

  **GitHub**.
    This is the best instrument you can use. It integrates communications
    with the product itself. The code you write and the discussions you
    have around it are literally in the same place.

Which one your project is using right now?
