There are plenty of books about software engineering, but few of them
are my favorite. All of them I read over and over again. I will update
this post in the future, when I stumble upon something decent.

by David West. This is the best book I've read about object-oriented
programming and it totally changed my understanding of it. I would
recommend to read it a few times. Before reading, try to forget everything
you've heard about programming before. Try to start from scratch. Maybe it will
work for you too :)
