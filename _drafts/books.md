There are plenty of books about software engineering, but few of them
are my favorite. All of them I read over and over again. Maybe I will update
this post in the future, when I stumble upon something decent.

I tried to put the most important books at the top of the list.

by David West.
This is the best book I've read about object-oriented
programming and it totally changed my understanding of it. I would
recommend to read it a few times. Before reading, try to forget everything
you've heard about programming before. Try to start from scratch. Maybe it will
work for you too :)

by Rita Mulcahy.
This book is my favorite about project management. Even though it's about
PMI approach and PMBOK in particular, it is a must read for everyone who
is interested in management. Ignore the PMBOK specifics and focus on
the philosophy of project management and the role of project manager in it.

by Glenford J. Myers et al.
You can read my short review of this book [here]({% pst 2015/aug/2015-08-22-art-of-software-testing %}).
The book perfectly explains the philosophy of testing and destroys
many typical myths and stereotypes. No matter what your job description is,
if you're working in software industry you should understand testing
and its fundamental principles. This is the only book you need to get that
understanding.

by Steve Freeman and Nat Pryce.
All you need to know about your unit testing is in this book. I didn't include
famous
[Kent Beck's book](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321146530/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0321146530&linkCode=as2&tag=yegor256com-20&linkId=S63Z5BJDORBGMZ2Z)
into this list, because I don't like it at all. You definitely should read
it, just to know what's going on, but it won't help you to write good tests.
Read this one instead and read it many times.

by Michael Feathers.
It's an awesome reading about modern software development, its pitfalls and
typical failures. Most of the code we're working now is legacy (aka open source).
I read this book as a novel.

{% badge /images/2015/04/book-continuous-delivery.jpg 96 http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321601912/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0321601912&linkCode=as2&tag=yegor256com-20&linkId=MPZUCBXBGNOIHDDI %}

by by Jez Humble and David Farley.
It is a perfect book about software delivery, continuous integration,
testing, packaging, versioning and many other techniques around programming.
Definitely a must-read for everybody who is serious about software engineering.

by Elliotte Rusty Harold and W. Scott Means.
XML is my favorite standard. And I hated it before I read this book. I didn't
understand all than strange prefixes, namespaces, XPath expressions and
schemas. Just this one book changed everything and since then I'm using XML
everywhere. It is very well written and easy to read. It's a must for everybody.

by Brian Goetz et al.
This is a very practical book about Java multi-threading and at the same time
it gives a lot of theoretical knowledge about concurrency in general. Highly
recommend to read it at least once.

by Scott Meyers.
No matter what language you're using, this book is very interesting and
very useful. It makes many important suggestions about better C++ coding. If
you understand most of them, your Java/Ruby/Python/Scala coding skills will
improve significantly.

by by Steve McConnell.
It's just a bible of clean coding. Read it a few times and use as a reference
manual in debates with your colleagues. It mentions the most terrible anti-patterns
and worst practices you may see in modern programming. To be a good programmer
you must know all of them.

by Steve McConnell.
It's an interesting read about software engineering and it's most tricky part &mdash; estimations.
Read it at least to be aware of the problem and possible solutions.

by Alistair Cockburn.
It's an old and very good book. You won't use anything from it in your
real projects, but you will get the philosophy of use cases, which will
turn your mind into the right direction. Don't take this book as something
practical, these use cases are hardly used now anywhere, but the idea of
scoping functionality this way is absolutely right.

by Karl Wiegers (Author) and Joy Beatty.
A perfect book about requirements analysis, the first and the most important
activity in any software project. Even if you're not an analyst, this book
is a must read.

by Jon Loeliger and Matthew McCullough.
It's a practical guide for Git, a version control system. Read it from
cover to cover and you will save many hours of your time in the future.
Git is a standard de-facto in version control and every programmer must
know its fundamental principles. Not from a cheat sheet, but from an original source.

by David Flanagan.
JavaScript is a language of modern Web and this book explains it very well.
No matter what kind of software you develop, you must know JavaScript. Don't read
it as a practical guide (even though it's called a guide), but instead, as
a food for thought. JavaScript has a lot to learn, for Java/Ruby/Python developers.

CSS is a not just about colors and shadows and it's not only for graphic designers.
CSS a key language of the modern Web. Every developer must know it, either
you're working with a back-end or front-end or desktop applications in C++.
