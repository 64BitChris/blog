It's not a secret that our salaries are a
[secret](https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidburkus/2016/02/02/why-do-we-keep-salaries-secret/).
Employers don't like their employees to know and discuss each other wages.
Moreover, <del>most</del> some of them put restrictive
[pay gag clauses](https://www.recruiter.com/i/gag-clause/) into
employment contracts or NDA-s. Recent studies demonstrate that such
a policy may be counter-productive and hurt performance. However, it seems
that most of researchers are missing the main point.

secrecy hurts because:
 - bosses hide something
 -

I believe that all that can be labeled as "weak management," which
means lack of professional knowledge and education, cowardness, laziness,
neglect, and good old plain stupidity.

A strong manager knows 1) how to define clear and explicit rules of work,
and 2) how to enforce them through a system of awards and punishments.

Even if pay secrecy comes with good intentions, this is its unintended effect: It tells workers that their bosses have something to hide

secrecy helps them cover up their bad decision making; and with secrecy, they do not have to correct the problems or defend what they have done.
with secrecy, managers can make poor pay decisions because they do not have to defend them
a clear relationship between pay and performance that may be very motivating becomes blurred and unclear because of secrecy

Organisations believe that employees cannot handle the truth about their value to the organisation relative to other employees
Employees are, however, still interested in pay even when there is no information provided by the organisation.
The absence of pay information creates the impression among employees that management has something to hide
Pay secrecy covers up the relationship between pay and performance:
High performing employees are particularly sensitive than others when they perceive no link between performance and pay
Hiding all the work behind a wall of secrecy reduces the effectiveness of the system and increases the risk of ad hoc decision making, which in turn can lead to legal challenges and reputational damage.
