There are plenty of books, articles and blog posts about _team morale_. They
all will suggest you something like regular celebrations, team events,
free lunches, pet-friendly offices, coffee machines, birthday presents, etc.
All of these are instruments of **concealed enslavering**.
These traditional techniques turn employees into
speachless monkeys, programming under influence of Prozac. Their existence
and popularity is our big misfortune. Let me present my own
vision of how team morale can be boosted in a software team. A team that
has a strong leader and a good project manager.

**Fire Fast**.
The first and the most important quality of a good leader is his or her
ability to separate bad apples from good ones, as soon as it is possible.
Nothing will give you more disrespect of the team than your tolerance to
underperforming team members. Your job as a leader is to help best players
to play better. And they can't play better if they see that the management
doesn't understand the difference between excellence and mediocracy. It's
a severe demotivating factor.

**Be Honest About Problems and Risks**.
Your team is following you and expect you to be a smart leader. While they
are writing Java you're talking to investors and customers. They want to
be sure that you know what you're doing. The best way to show them that
you have no idea where the team is going is to tell them that the future
is bright and cloudless. Everybody understands that it's either a lie and you
are trying to hide risks or you're stupid enough to not see them. In either
case, the best people would try to quit until it's too late. Thus, to keep
morale up, regularly inform your people about problems you're facing and
risks you're trying to prevent. They will appreciate it and respect you.
A strong and professional manager is dealing with risks instead of ignoring them.

**Failures Are Yours, Success Is Theirs**.
Always remember that when someone from your team makes a mistake &mdash;
first of all it's _your_ personal mistake. You hired that person,
you trained him or her, you delegated
the responsibility, you controlled and monitored. Now he made
a mistake and the project lost money, a customer or reputation. Of course you need to
take necessary disciplinary actions and maybe fire the trouble maker. But first of all
you have to admit in front of everybody that it was your personal mistake.
You didn't control enough, you didn't plan well, you didn't take preventive actions.
This is what the team is expecting from you. Also, your people are expecting
you to explain them how you're going to learn from this mistake to prevent
a similar one from happening. A strong leader doesn't afraid to look
stupid in front of the team. A weak leader does look stupid when he or she
is trying to hide mistakes made.

**Responsibility Is Always Personal**.
The best demotivating word is "together", used in task descriptions. Don't use it.
Each task has to be personally and individually assigned (no matter what Agile Manifesto says).
Everybody is responsible for his or her
own success or failure. How their results will join together and lead to
a mutual success or failure &mdash; it's _your_ business. Will you succeed or
fail, we all will see. Once you're saying that we all have to succeed together,
the team understands that you're trying to shift responsibility from your
shoulders to theirs. It's a sign of weakness and you lose respect. Make
tasks and goals strictly personal and be prepared to be responsible for
a group success. You, as a manager, break down an entire project into
parts and delegate them to your people. If you do this job properly,
we all will succeed. But don't try to blame us if that parts will fall apart.

**Don't Mention Steve Jobs**.
Try to avoid global slogans and world domination speeches in the office,
in front of the team. They de-motivate. If we're doing so good, why
our salaries are not reflecting this success yet? If your vision is so global,
why it's not yet implemented in reality? Don't promise to become the next Steve Jobs.
Instead, become the next good manager of a highly paid team that is solving
interesting problems for real people. Your practical achievements, no matter
how small and down to earth they are, will give you much more respect than
many-hours speeches about our fantastic future.

**Don't Say a Word About Agile**.
Even though Agile is a great attitude-changing and mind-shifting concept,
it is absolutely un-applicable to practice. Mostly because it is too
abstract. When you're manifesting in the office that we should value
"working software over comprehensive documentation" &mdash; it sounds like
you don't know what you're doing. The team doesn't need such abstract
slogans from you. The needs specific instructions and rules, in order
to follow them and earn results, money, and satisfaction. Agile is a set
of abstract principles, which you should understand and digest. But then,
after you chew them properly, convert them to specific and
very unambitious rules of work. Don't talk about Agile, be agile.

**Don't Close The Door**.
Responsibility is personal, money is personal, and results are personal. But
their discussions should be open to everybody. Don't close the door to that
meeting room when you're talking about problems or appraising someone's
results. You want your team to work together? Give everybody an assurance
that none of them will be terminated behind a closed door. These pompous
speeches about "us working together" usually turn into mush once the team
sees that someone gets fires after a private conversation with a manager.
Are we together or it's you against us? To keep team morale up you, as a leader,
have to establish ground rules of work, which will define who gets what
when we succeed and who goes home first when we fail. These rules should
be open for everybody. These rules should rule the team, not your personal
decisions made behind a closed door.

**Celebrate Achievements Instead of Birthdays**.
Team building events is a great tool to boost team morale, but only when
they are built around personal or team achievements, instead of calendar events.
A project team is not a group of friends or family members, even though
some teams may feel like that. No matter how it feels, a team is here
for one reason &mdash; to create the product and make money for its sponsor.
This is the direction we're going. Our goal is not to build a community and
live together till the end of our days. Our goal is to achieve business
success of the product we're developing or, in other words, complete the project.
When the only events we're celebrating are our birthdays, it's a sign to
us that our leaders are trying to lie to us. They are pretending that we're
here to make a community of friends, while in reality they are using us to
build their business. It's unhealthy and ruins team morale. Instead, celebrate
achievements on your real path &mdash; to the success of the product under
development. This will show everybody that you, as a leader, is honest with
your people and is ready to show them that their true role in the team is
to develop a product and earn money for investors. Honesty is the best
team morale booster.

**Don't Rule, Make Rules and Plans**.
Nothing demotivates more than an upredictable manager. For the team you,
the manager, is a abstraction of the entire world around the team. They see
the reality through the prism of your personality. What you tell them about
the reality is what they perceive. If you are unpredictable &mdash; the reality
is unpredictable and scary for them. To avoid that, stop making decisions that
are based on your personal and momentary judgement.
Instead, make decisions that are based on the
rules you've defined upfront and plans you've drawn before. First, create a plan of the team
growth and announce it to everybody. The plan should include risks and
their mitigations. The plan should say who will fired
first when/if the project goes down. The plan should give a predictable
and measurable picture of the reality around your office. It should be a map
of terrain you're going to cross with your team. When it's time to make
a decision, everybody will understand why it's made and will respect you
as a leader that predicted the situation and managed it professionally.

**Put Money On The Table**.
Discuss money openly and freely, right in the office, right in front
of everybody. This advice is for true professionals. If you can't do what
is said above, don't try this one. But if you consider yourself a real
pro in management and leadership, you should put money on the table and
let everybody know who is getting what, when, why and why not. Everybody
should know everybody's salaries, bonuses, benefits and rationale behind them.
Each programmer should know what he or she should do in order to get
a $5,000 raise to the annual salary. Also, he or she should know why his
colleague is calles "Senior Developer" while his or her title is still "Junior".
This information should be public and printed on the wall, right behind
your chair. Why most manager don't do this? Because they don't have any
rationale behind their monetary decisions. Instead of managing the money
they let money manage them. That's a subject for another post :)
