Team morale.

There are plenty of books, articles and blog posts about team morale. They
all will suggest you something like regular celebrations, team events,
free lunches, pet-friendly offices, coffee machines, birthday presents, etc.
All of these are instruments of **concealed enslavering**.
These traditional techniques turn employees into
speachless monkeys, programming under influence of Prozac. Here is my
vision of how you can boost team morale in your team, if you're a strong leader
and a good manager.

**Fire Fast**.
The first and the most important quality of a good leader is his or her
ability to separate bad apples from good ones, as soon as it is possible.
Nothing will give you more disrespect of the team than your tolerance to
underperforming team members. Your job as a leader is to help best players
to play better. And they can't play better if they see that the management
doesn't understand the difference between excellence and mediocracy. It's
a severe demotivating factor.

**Be Honest About Problems and Risks**.
Your team is following you and expect you to be a smart leader. While they
are writing Java you're talking to investors or customers. They want to
be sure that you know what you're doing. The best way to show them that
you have no idea where the team is going is to tell them that the future
is bright and cloudless. Everybody understands that it's either a lie and you
are trying to hide risks or you're stupid enough to not see them. In either
case, the best people would try to quit until it's too late. Thus, to keep
morale up, regularly inform your people about problems you're facing and
risks you're trying to prevent. They will appreciate it and respect you.
A strong and professional manager is dealing with risks. Not ignoring them.

**Failures Are Yours, Success Is Theirs**.
Always remember that when someone from your team makes a mistake &mdash;
it's your personal mistake. You hired that guy, you trained him, you delegated
him that responsibility, you controlled him and monitored him. Now he made
a mistake and the project lost money or a customer. Of course you need to
take necessary disciplinary actions and maybe fire the dude. But first of you
you have to admit in front of everybody that it was your personal mistake.
This is what the team is expecting from you. Also, your people are expecting
you to explain them how you're going to learn from this mistake to prevent
a similar one from happening. A strong leader doesn't afraid to look
stupid in front of the team. A weak leader does look stupid when he or she
is trying to hide his or her mistakes.

**Responsibility Is Always Personal**.
The best demotivating word is "together", used in task descriptions. Don't use it.
Each task has to be personally and individually assigned, no matter what Agile Manifesto says.
Everybody is responsible for his or her
own success or failure. How their results will join together and lead to
a mutual success or failure &mdash; it's your business. Will you succeed or
fail, we will see. Once you're saying that we all have to succeed together,
the team understands that you're trying to shift responsibility from your
shoulders to theirs. It's a sign of weakness and you lose respect. Make
tasks and goals strictly personal and be prepared to be responsible for
a group success. You, as a manager, break down an entire project into
parts and delegate them to your people. If you do this job properly,
we all will succeed. But don't blame us if that parts will fall apart.

**Don't Mention Steve Jobs**.
Try to avoid global slogans and world domination speeches in the office,
in front of the team. They de-motivate. If you we're doing so good, why
our salaries are not reflecting this success? If your vision is so global,
why it's not yet implemented in reality? Don't promise to become the next Steve Jobs.
Instead, become the next good manager of a highly paid team solving
interesting problems for real people. Your practical achievements, no matter
how small and down to earth they are, will give you much more respect than
many-hours speeches about our fantastic future.

**Put Money On The Table**.
Discuss money openly and freely, right in the office.

**Don't Say a Word About Agile**.
Even though Agile is a great attitude-changing and mind-shifting concept,
it is absolutely un-applicable to practice. Mostly because it is too
abstract. When you're manifesting in the office that we should value
"working software over comprehensive documentation" &mdash; it sounds like
you don't know what you're doing. The team doesn't need such abstract
slogans from you. The needs specific instructions and rules, in order
to follow them and earn results, money, and satisfaction. Agile is a set
of abstract principles, which you should understand and digest. But then,
after you chew them properly and digest, convert them to specific and
very unambitious rules of work. Don't mention Agile, be agile.

discuss money openly

celebrate personal achievements

work in the same room

define ground rules for awards and punishment (no compromises)
