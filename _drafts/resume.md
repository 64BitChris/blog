There are tons of articles about resume writing. Literally,
[tons of them](https://www.google.com/search?q=how+to+write+resume).
Here is yet another one? Well, maybe... but I don't think so. I'll try to
give you a few **practical** hints on how to make your resume look
"sexier" and position you above a "good programmer" category, right into
the super-star zone. It make take a few years to truly pimp up your CV, but
when it's done, you will charge $100+ per hour, facing no hesitation
in paying them.

## One Page, No Exceptions

I think it's obvious, but only one out of ten resumes I'm getting
every day fits into one page. All others take 3+ pages and this looks
very unprofessional. If you can't explain yourself in one page, they will doubt
your skills of scope management, which are very important for a software engineer.
You simply can't filter out what's non-important and focus
on what really matters. Besides, it's just boring to read three pages.

Thus, strictly one page, no exceptions. Your resume is an "executive summary"
of the product you're trying to sell. It's a marketing brochure. A sales
flyer. A sticker on my refrigerator, if you wish. It has to be short
and straight forward. They either buy it or throw away. They don't want to read it,
they want to buy you. Or to throw your brochure away.
4-page brochures have way less chances than one pagers.

## Don't Lie

No matter what you do with your resume, never lie in any single word. You
can tell half of the truth, you can hide some information, you can re-phrase
the truth, but never lie. You don't know who is reading your CV and which
desk will it end up on. Be ready to answer for every word you have there.

If you're saying that you're an "expert in JavaScript",
be ready to explain what are the key new features of
ECMAScript version 6. You can't? Don't use the word "expert". The point
is that you have to be ready to prove every word.

## Sexy Photo on the Top

You want them to work with you? They want to see you. So, a photo is a mandatory
component of a CV. And try to make it look sexy and artistic. Ask your
friend graphic designer to style it. Maybe even pay for this work.
Pay attention to the photo, it's very important.

Do I have to say that you must smile on that photo? Well, yes, you must.
And make it casual, with a t-shirt and funny background. You must look
relaxed and successful. You don't want to get hired, they want to hire you &mdash;
this is the message your photo is sending. Just like in online dating.

## Skip "Objective" and "Title"

"Senior Software Developer", "Seasoned Java Programmer",
"Talented IT Professional", etc. It's boring and doesn't sell you at all.
They know who you're, since they are reading your resume.

Besides that, you're limitting yourself with that title. Maybe they are looking
for a VP/Engineering, while your resume says "Software Architect". That's
immediately a mismatch for them. It's against you. Your **name** is the title
of your resume. That's it.

## A Dozen Skills

This section in your resume actually tells them about your "tech focus".
It must have a very short list of skills. Definitely, **below twelve**. You simply
can't be an expert in MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and MS SQL at the same time.
If there are too many skills, it's a sign of a "jack of all trades", who is
almost always a "master of none". Don't do that.

Find the most important skills in your profile and put them there.
Just a few. And make sure the skills are all on the same level of abstraction.
Java and AngularJS must not be present together. Java is a few levels bigger
than AngularJS. Thus, it's either "Java, SQL and HTTP" or "AngularJS, Spring Framework,
and Web Sockets". I would recommend to stay at the lowest level you can, until
you become a serious market figure. Say, "Java" as a skill would look good
in [John Skeet](...)'s resume, since he definitely knows the entire Java and the
market recognized that. But if you're just a three-year old experience programmer,
how come you "know Java"? You barely know a few hundred classes from there.
That's why, better say specifically what parts of Java you definitely know.
Like I said, be as low-level and specific in your skills as possible.

## StackOverflow Profile

No matter what anyone [says]({% pst 2014/oct/2014-10-29-how-much-do-you-cost %}),
[StackOverflow](http://www.stackoverflow.com)
is a de-facto standard platform for asking and answering technical questions.
Your presence there and your high rating are a clear message to your
potential employer that you're a super star (or a rising one). No so many
people have 100k+ reputation points there. You must be one of them.

So, even if you don't have a StackOverflow profile now, create it.
Spend one hour every day. for a few months, answering
[new questions](http://stackoverflow.com/?tab=interesting).
You will earn 1000+ reputation points. Well, provided you have something to say.
That's enough. Post a link to your profile right into your resume.

Even if you don't have much to say, be there. Read answers made by others,
comment on them, try to help them and correct. Become an active
part of the community.

## GitHub Profile

GitHub is a de-facto standard platform for open source code. There are others,
like BitBucket, but, I hope, they will die, sooner or later. As a modern
software developer, you must be on GitHub. You
[have to contribute]({% pst 2015/dec/2015-12-22-why-dont-you-contribute-to-open-source %})
to some open source. You have to be visible in open source world, if you
want to sell yourself high.

Your potential employer wants to see what the **market** is thinking about
your code and about yourself. They are afraid to make a mistake by hiring you.
Your presence in open source world is a guarantee for them. Someone already
saw your code, someone gave some kudos to your projects. Someone virtually
vouches for you. They will feel more comfortable in hiring you.

To be in the "elite", you don't have to spend all of your time in open source
projects. Just contribute to the ones you're using already. You're using
Sinatra at work? Check their source code. You will find a lot of places that
need improvement. Offer them your help and simply submit small pull requests
here and there. Besides that, create your own products and market them. You will
be surprised how many users and followers you will earn, in just a few years
of that activity.

## Certificates

Some may say that they are not important. Maybe so. But your resume must have
them. Some of them are not so difficult to get. Just a few weeks of study,
a few hundred dollars and you are not just a Java programmer, but
a [certified](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_Certification_Program) one.
There are not so many of them out there. There are millions of Java coders
in the world, but only a few percents of them are certified. No matter, whether
you think it's important or not &mdash; get that certifications.

As many as you like. But stay away from
[BrainBench](https://www.brainbench.com/) and similar ones. Well,
you can get certified there, but don't put them into your resume. That will
only demonstrate that you are proud of a very questional achievement. Not
a good sign.

## Sound Names and Numbers

It's a dangerous trick, be careful. Here is how it works. You have to go through
your entire professional history and find well-known names or big numbers.
For example, ten years ago I was helping a startup create a software, which
they were subscribing IBM to. They managed to get some tracking and in
two months IBM decided not to use them. It's a true (and sad) story. I can put something
like this into my resume: "wrote software for IBM". Am I lying? Not really.
If they ask me what exactly I did for IBM, I will explain. In most cases, they
won't ask. They will just buy this big name and put my resume on top of
others.

The same you can do with numbers. There is another true story. A few years ago,
I was helping a company configure continuous integration pipeline. Not a big
deal, but the company was serving over 5 million hits per day on their website.
It's a big number. I had nothing to do with this big web traffic, but I was
in that company for a few months. So, I may say in my resume:
"configured delivery pipeline for 5M+/hits-per-day web store". If they
ask me for details, I will be able to give them. I'm not lying.

Use this technique carefully, never lie. But do it. Don't be scared.
Your resume needs big names and numbers.

## Blog

Create your own blog. Start writing. About what? About your every day
achievements. About the code you write and read.
About what you observe in the office. About your thoughts
and your plans. About the books you read. You absolutely need to have
a blog, if you position yourself as an expensive software engineer.

It doesn't need to be a very popular blog, don't focus on numbers. But
it has to be properly created, designed and hosted. Don't use
[WordPress](http://www.wordpress.com), [Blogger](http://www.blogger.com)
or [Tumblr](http://www.tumblr.com). Instead,
I would recommend to think about static site generators, like Jekyll, and host
it all on GitHub pages. That's what I'm doing.

Besides being a valuable addition to your resume,
a systematic and regular writing will help you structure
your thoughts, plans and decisions. Well, that's what I'm getting
from my blog.

## Education

I would limit yourself to a few letters in this area. Just "MSc" or "BSc" is
enough. No need to say when did you graduate and which school. You can
give that details later. Well, there are just two exceptions to this rule.

First, if you're a PhD. Put it on top of your CV. It's important and
it's valuable. Simply because there are not so many of them among programmers.
Second, if your school is Stanford, MIT or similar. If that's the case,
also put it on top of the CV.

In all other situations, just BSc and that's it.

## Conferences

Every year you must give a few presentations at JavaOne. I'm kidding.
About the JavaOne part, but the "every year" part is very true. You must
regularly make some speeches somewhere. Preferrably, at JavaOne. But until
you get there, speak where you can. Well, where they accept you. Create
a profile at [lanyrd](http://www.lanyrd.com) (or something similar) and
check regularly which conferences are looking for speakers. Submit there
and you will be surprised to see that some of them will actually accept
some of your ideas.

The easiest subjects to start with are stories about your practical
experience with some modern technologies and tools. Something like
"How Docker Helps Us Optimize Delivery" or
"Five Apache Spark Installation Issues". Just describe what you've done
in your recent project. It doesn't really matter what will you talk about.
What matters is that you're visible. The market accepts you &mdash;
the employer will trust you more. That's exactly what you need in order
to request a higher rate.

## Carrer History

I'll be speaking for myelf here

## ACM, IEEE, JUG, and other memberships

They mean literally nothing, but will demonstrate that you are
part of the community. Just like with most other things mentioned above,
employers will trust you more if the market already trusts you. These
memberships don't really mean that anyone recognized you. You can get them
just by paying annual fees. But still, you're paying that fees and most
other CVs don't. See?

## Mention Hobbies

I think this information is important. Some say it's not, but I believe
that a personal "click" between you and your potential employer plays
an important role. There is a human on that side. He or she is reading
your CV and he or she wants to like you. Again, in order to be comfortable
to make a hiring decision. Help him or her like you faster. Mention that
you like skiing, feed monkeys in the zoo and watch Jimmy Kimmel. Be creative,
don't be boring. Just like in dating.

## Layout/Graphics

How should your onepage look? Stand out. It should show your personality.
Don't use that "resume templates" downloadable for free. Create your own
layout and design. If you're not a designer, ask your Photoshop friend
to do it for you. There is not much to do, just select the right font
and add a few colors here and there.

This CV is your product. You made it. It's your baby. If it's just a Word
document, in a standard template, they will feel that you didn't pay
attention to it. You didn't even care to create that little and very
important product nicely. How will you create their software? With the
same attitude. Don't ruin the whole show by a careless design. That's the
key word here &mdash; careless. It doesn't need to be complex. It may be
very simple. But it must be **yours**. Made with care and love.

As you've probably guessed already, I apply all that recommendations
to my own personal resume. That's how I build my profile. Here is the current
version of my CV: [yegor-bugayenko.pdf](). What do you think?
