There are tons of articles about resume writing. Literally, tons of them.
Here is yet another one? Well, maybe... but I don't think so. I'll try to
give you a few practical hints on how to make your resume look
"sexier" and position you above a "good programmer" category, right into
the super-star zone. It make take a few years to truly pimp your CV, but
when it's done, you will charge $100+ per hour facing no hesitation
in paying them.

## One Page, No Exceptions

I think it's obvious, but only one out of ten resumes I'm getting
every day fits into one page. All others take 3+ pages and this looks
very unprofessional. If you can't explain yourself in one page, I will doubt
your skills of scope management, which are very important for a software engineer.
You simply can't filter out what's non-important and focus
on what really matters.

Thus, strictly one page, no exceptions. Your resume is an "executive summary"
of the product you're trying to sell. It's a marketing brochure. A sales
flyer. A sticker on my refrigerator, if you wish. It has to be short
and straight forward. I either buy it or throw it away. I don't want to read it,
I want to buy you. Or to throw your brochure away.

4-page brochures have way less chances than one pagers.

## Don't Lie

No matter what you do with your resume, never lie in any single word. You
can tell half of the truth, you can hide some information, you can re-phrase
the truth, but never lie. You don't know who is reading your CV and which
desk will it end up on. Be ready to answer for every word you have there.

## Sexy Photo on Top

I'm going to work with you, I want to see you. So, a photo is a mandatory
component of a CV. And try to make it look sexy and artistic. Ask your
friend graphic designer to style it. Maybe even pay for this work.
Pay attention to the photo, it's very important.

## Skip "Objective" and "Title"

"Senior Software Developer", "Seasoned Java Programmer",
"Talented IT Professional", etc. It's boring and doesn't sell you at all.
I know who you're, since I'm reading your resume.
