There are tons of articles about resume writing. Literally, tons of them.
Here is yet another one? Well, maybe... but I don't think so. I'll try to
give you a few practical hints on how to make your resume look
"sexier" and position you above a "good programmer" category, right into
the super-star zone. It make take a few years to truly pimp your CV, but
when it's done, you will charge $100+ per hour, facing no hesitation
in paying them.

## One Page, No Exceptions

I think it's obvious, but only one out of ten resumes I'm getting
every day fits into one page. All others take 3+ pages and this looks
very unprofessional. If you can't explain yourself in one page, I will doubt
your skills of scope management, which are very important for a software engineer.
You simply can't filter out what's non-important and focus
on what really matters.

Thus, strictly one page, no exceptions. Your resume is an "executive summary"
of the product you're trying to sell. It's a marketing brochure. A sales
flyer. A sticker on my refrigerator, if you wish. It has to be short
and straight forward. I either buy it or throw it away. I don't want to read it,
I want to buy you. Or to throw your brochure away.
4-page brochures have way less chances than one pagers.

## Don't Lie

No matter what you do with your resume, never lie in any single word. You
can tell half of the truth, you can hide some information, you can re-phrase
the truth, but never lie. You don't know who is reading your CV and which
desk will it end up on. Be ready to answer for every word you have there.

If you're saying that you're an "expert in JavaScript",
be ready to explain what are the key new features of
ECMAScript version 6. You can't? Don't use the word "expert".

## Sexy Photo on the Top

You want me to work with you? I want to see you. So, a photo is a mandatory
component of a CV. And try to make it look sexy and artistic. Ask your
friend graphic designer to style it. Maybe even pay for this work.
Pay attention to the photo, it's very important.

Do I have to say that you must smile on that photo? Well, yes, you must.

## Skip "Objective" and "Title"

"Senior Software Developer", "Seasoned Java Programmer",
"Talented IT Professional", etc. It's boring and doesn't sell you at all.
I know who you're, since I'm reading your resume.

Besides that, you're limitting yourself with that title. Maybe I'm looking
for a VP/Engineering, while your resume says "Software Architect". That's
immediately a mismatch for me. It's against you. Your name is the title
of your resume. That's it.

## A Dozen Skills

This section in your resume actually tells me about your "tech focus".
It must have a very short list of skills. Definitely, below twelve. You simply
can't be an expert in MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and MS SQL at the same time.
If there are too many skills, it's a sign of a "jack of all trades", who is
actually a "master of none". Don't do that.

Find the most important skills in your profile and put them there.
Just a dozen.

## StackOverflow Profile

No matter what anyone [says]({% pst 2014/oct/2014-10-29-how-much-do-you-cost %}),
[StackOverflow](http://www.stackoverflow.com)
is a de-facto standard platform for asking and answering technical questions.
You must be there, if you're working in the field of software development.
Don't tell me, your potential employer, that you're writing software for
"over 10 years" and haven't had any questions, which you weren't able to
answer yourself. You had them? How did you find answers? In books? No way.

We all know that StackOverflow is where all programmers find answers. Well,
provided they are actually writing something,
not just collecting their paychecks. So, you do find answers there. And you
don't post your own answers? You don't post questions? This is simply
impossible. Well, it's possible, if you're one of those who are collecting
paychecks, writing nothing.

So, even if you don't have a StackOverflow profile now, create it.
Spend one hour every day. for a few months, answering
[new questions](http://stackoverflow.com/?tab=interesting).
You will earn 1000+ reputation points. Well, provided you have something to say.
That's enough. Post a link to your profile right into your resume.

## GitHub Profile

GitHub is a de-facto standard platform for open source code. There are others,
like BitBucket, but, I hope, they will die, sooner or later. As a modern
software developer, you must be there. You have to contribute to some
open source. You have to be present on GitHub.

As your potential employer, I want to see what the **market** is thinking about
your code and about yourself. Just like with StackOverflow, I need to see
your reputation among other software developers. There is no reputation? There
is no open source contribution? Well, I will have my doubts.

Anyway, to be the best, you have to have a strong GitHub profile. It's not
so difficult to create it.

## Certificates

Some may say that they are not important. Maybe so. But your resume must have
them. Some of them are not so difficult
