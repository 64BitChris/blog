There are tons of articles about resume writing. Literally, tons of them.
Here is yet another one? Well, maybe... but I don't think so. Read on.

## One Page, No Exceptions

I think it's obvious, but only one out of ten resumes I'm getting
every day fits into one page. All others take 3+ pages and this looks
very unprofessional. If you can't explain yourself in one page, I will doubt
your skills of scope management, which are very important for a software engineer.
You simply can't filter out what's
non-important and focus on what really matters.

Thus, strictly one page, no exceptions. Your resume is an "executive summary"
of the product you're trying to sell. It's a marketing brochure. A sales
flyer. A sticker on my refrigerator, if you wish. It has to be short
and straight forward. I either buy it or throw it away. I don't want to read it,
I want to buy you. Or to throw your brochure away.

Four page brochures have way less chances than one pagers.
