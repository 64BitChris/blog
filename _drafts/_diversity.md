[Bobby Fischer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobby_Fischer),
the eleventh World Chess Champion, was one of the best chess players
of the last century. Did you know that,
among [anti-semitic statements](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Bobby_Fischer),
[he said](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/apr/22/sportandleisure.features)
that women chess players "aren’t creative and are all fish?"
Did you know that he publicly described the
[9/11 events](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_11_attacks) as "wonderful news"?

[Henry Ford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Ford),
a founder of
[Ford Motor Company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Motor_Company),
was one of the greatest American entrepreneurs. Did you know that he
[said](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Henry_Ford#Quotes) in 1919
that "the Jew is the threat" and wrote an anti-semitic set of booklets called
[The International Jew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_International_Jew)?

[Thomas Jefferson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson),
was the third president of the United States. Did you know that he believed
that blacks lacked basic human emotions and
[claimed](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/01/opinion/the-real-thomas-jefferson.html)
he had "never seen an elementary trait of painting or sculpture"
or poetry among blacks and argued that blacks’ ability to "reason" was
"much inferior" to whites', while
"in imagination they are dull, tasteless, and anomalous?"

Did you know that Garry Kasparov,
one of greatest chess player of all time and a world chess champion,
[said](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/12/02/garry-kasparov-wrong-women-playing-chess/)
in a 1989 interview with Playboy magazine that "there is real chess and women's chess."

I can go on and on with similar examples. Do you agree with these guys?
Most probably you, just like me, don't. Most probably you have your own
views. Political, social, racial, and what have you.
The question is---what do you do with them. And what do you do with those you
disagree with. Do you stop listening to them? Do you call them stupid,
despite their obvious achivements in their trades? Do you ostracize them
in order to stay only with those who share your views?

Let me give a practical example. This July, just four month ago,
I submitted an article to [InfoQ](http://www.infoq.com/), a rather
popular online tech magazine. In the article I
suggested that in order to improve our projects we must not make programmers worry
about the quality of code they write, but instead let them mostly focus
on the speed of delivery. The quality, I argued in the
article, must be the concern of the delivery pipeline. You most probably
read my blog posts, where I mentioned that, especially this one:
[Don't Aim for Quality, Aim for Speed]({% pst 2018/mar/2018-03-06-speed-vs-quality %}).

I received a response from InfoQ editor over the email, I quote:
"The article provides no new insights for our audience, and actually some recommendations
that go against well-known good practices in DevOps."
I [twitted](https://twitter.com/yegor256/status/1015261994826567680)
about that and Churles Humble, their editor-in-chief, emailed me back.
He said that he still didn't want to publish my piece, because
"both people who reviewed it are experienced DevOps practitioners,
and felt strongly that, although the ideas presented were interesting,
it wasn’t something that would generalize well or work well for more mature teams."

As you seeTwo people decided that my point of view was wrong and that's why the entire
audience must not hear it. They know better what "works well for more mature teams."
Pay attention, they didn't say anything about
the quality of my article, about the way I structured my arguments, about the
consistency of the logic in it. They totally got what I wanted to say, but they
disagreed. My opinion didn't go along with theirs. That's why---no stage for the guy.

You want to know what happened next?
I submitted that article to the blog section of the Communications of the ACM
and it was [published](https://cacm.acm.org/blogs/blog-cacm/229942-blame-free-quality-control/fulltext) there.
I also submitted it to a number of software conferences, where it was accepted,
including [Joker](https://youtu.be/55mwAbuDrV8) in St. Petersburg, Russia.

Here comes my point. We may disagree with others. It happens. Their ideas
may be wrong, just like those DevOps practices I suggested, or very wrong,
just like that Fischer's suggestion that all jews are a threat. However, we have
to find a way to hear them out and argue with them. Blocking them---is not
the method.

We want to live in a better world with no hate, racism, or inequality?
We want more stable software and more effective DevOps practices?
To make that happen we must not shut up those we disagree with, no matter how wrong, according
to our own opinion, they are! Instead, we must encourage open dialogue with them.

Instead of firing sexists, just like Google
[recently did](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-08-08/google-fires-employee-behind-controversial-diversity-memo),
we have to let them and everybody speak freely and openly.

We must learn to find arguments instead of enemies.
