In [teamed.io](http://www.teamed.io) we work in distributed teams and
keep all our communications [in tickets]({% pst 2014/oct/2014-10-07-stop-chatting-start-coding %}).
Besides that, we [encourage]({% pst 2014/apr/2014-04-13-bugs-are-welcome %}) every developer in every project to
report bugs whenever he or she finds it. We even pay for each bug found.
