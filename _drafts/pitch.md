Your success depends on the quality of your pitch. Basically, your
success doesn't depend on almost anything else. The pitch is the king.
You have to impress the <del>catcher</del> investor in just a few seconds, while
the elevator is still moving (that's where you are supposed to approach
that poor person). It's not a rocket science, you can learn a few basic
principles and become a expert. Here they are. The principles.

<!--more-->

**Zuck's Look**.
Rule number one, you must look right. Like Mark Zuckerberg &mdash; the
same gray t-shirt everyday with the same smile. The way you look must demonstrate
that you're part of the community. You're one of us!
These three things will help: a beard,
an electric skateboard, and an Apple Watch. If you're a girl, replace the beard
with a yoga mat and you're all set. By looking that way you're telling
investors that your chances to succeed are way higher than of anyone who
doesn't have Apple Watch and is a stranger because of that.

**Innovate**.
These are the words you must include in your pitch &mdash; innovation, innovative,
innovate. It's never too many. Put them (or their synonyms) everywhere,
it's only for good. How about this: "our innovative solution
is an environmental breakthrough". Nobody knows what it means, but everybody
understands that you're a big time innovator. Even if it's just a yet
another calories calculator. Investors must understand that you're not just
making a software product, you innovate.

**Words**.
Internet of Things instead of a thermometer,
Augmented Reality instead of goggles with a camera,
Global Health instead of a database of doctors and patients. You got the idea.
Don't be specific, it's dangerous. They may ask you what kind of database
is that and how it is different from another fifty databases on the market. But
if you're saying Global Health, they won't have any idea what you're talking
about, which is exactly what you need. Learn that words and use them wherever
possible. Just a few for you to remember: business model canvas, viral
mechanics, growth hacking, data-driven mentality, design thinking, and
game-changing disruption.

**Smile!**.
You are super excited about this fantastic opportunity! You're extremely
motivated to do this project with these absolutely great people! You're
passionated about the idea and fully-committed to implement it! You love the
team, the partners, the investors, and the customers &mdash; they all
are very nice people you're happy to work with! You're very enthusiastic about
everything! You love everyone! ... But, be careful, don't overact or you may
end up in a mental hospital.

**Uber**.
Compare yourself to Uber, you will never lose. It was Airbnb a few years
ago and Dropbox even before that. Today it's Uber. Start your pitch with
"It's like Uber, but..." No matter what you put after that, it will work.
All investors are dreaming about getting a new Uber in their portfolio. You
should help them in making this dream come true. No need to be too complicated,
just say that you're "like Uber, but" and your chances to score Round A
will become higher.

**Elon Musk**.
You have to mention this guy, you absolutely must. Try this:
"as Elon Musk said in his book, it is very difficult to build a successful
startup". You being aware of a wisdom like that will give them an impression
that you're related to the Silicon Valley culture, which is what they want to feel.
Always try to show that Elon Musk is a role model for you. Having a t-shirt
with his face will also help.
BTW, don't use Steven Jobs, it's not a trend any more.
Moreover, he is dead already. Stick to Musk.

**Co-founders**.
You absolutely must have a co-founder, or even a few of them. They could
be anybody. A room mate will work or just a friend of friend who recently
quit her full time job. It doesn't matter who they are, as long as you
can call them co-founders. Put their pictures and names on your website
and always say "we" instead of "I". Investors, in general, love to have
a few phone numbers they can call, when they realize that their money are gone
and there is nothing left. Also, it's more fun to invest into a group
of people &mdash; investors look more serious in that case.

**The Market**.
You have to mention that the market is absolutely huge. At least a hundred
billion dollars. They won't be able to check anyway. Actually, nobody
can check that, so don't worry. But don't give a round number, that would be a mistake! It
should sound more like $73.5B. That's very convincing and will give
them the confidence you need &mdash; the market is huge and you're not
just saying it, you actually did some math. How can they not invest
into such a huge and promising market?

Rehearse your pitch in front of the mirror, in the bathroom, three times
every morning. I guarantee it, in less than four weeks you will sound
like a proper Silicon Valley startup founder. Well, a co-founder,
don't forget that. Good luck, you will need a lot of it!
