We, at [Teamed.io](http://www.teamed.io), are getting
about 10 resumes every day from programmers who want to work
with us. We don't make video or online coding interviews. We don't
ask them to solve any puzzles or to demonstrate their
algorithms writing abilities. Moreover, when we decide not to
hire, we honestly and openly explain why. And we almost
never have anyone offended. There are a few basic principles,
which I would like to share.

## The Market Interviews You, Not Us

We believe that the market is a much better interviewer than
anyone of us. "_Instead of demonstrating us how great is your
code, show it to the market and see what it says_" &mdash; that's what
we're saying to our candidates.

How does the market validate?
[Open source]({% pst 2015/dec/2015-12-22-why-dont-you-contribute-to-open-source %}).
This is what is the most convincing.
We ask them to show us what open source products they have and how
popular they are.

Then, show us your blog, your conference talks, your hackatons
gold medals, your certifications, and any other awards the market
gave you. Don't convince us that you're cool, convince them. If they
will be convinced, we will be glad to hire you. Isn't it objective?
I believe, it its.
