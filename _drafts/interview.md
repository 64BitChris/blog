We, at [Teamed.io](http://www.teamed.io), are getting
about 10 resumes every day from programmers who want to work
with us. We don't make video or online coding interviews. We don't
ask you to solve any puzzles or to demonstrate your
algorithms-writing abilities. Moreover, when we decide not to
hire, we honestly and openly explain why. And we almost
never have anyone offended. How exactly it works?
There are a few basic principles, which I would like to share.

## The Market Interviews You, Not Us

We believe that the market is a much better interviewer than
anyone of us. "_Instead of demonstrating us how great is your
code, show it to the market and see what it says_" &mdash; that's what
we're saying to you, our candidate.

How does the market validate?
[Open source]({% pst 2015/dec/2015-12-22-why-dont-you-contribute-to-open-source %}) &mdash;
this is what is the most convincing for us.
We ask you to show what open source products you have and how
popular they are.

Then, show us your blog, your conference talks, your hackatons
gold medals, your certifications, and any other awards the market
gave you. Don't convince us that you're cool, convince them. If they
will be convinced, we will be glad to hire you. Isn't it objective?
I believe, it is.

## Quiz

The way we understand quality of code is
[very different]({% pst 2014/aug/2014-08-13-strict-code-quality-control %})
comparing to what you may
expect. Simply put, our quality bar is much higher. Besides that, the
way we understand object-oriented programming is also
[very different]({% pst 2016/feb/2016-02-03-design-patterns-and-anti-patterns %}). Putting
this all together &mdash; sometimes we simply don't trust the market, as the only
source of information. Especially, when the market has almost nothing to say about you.
Some programmers come to us with zero
[open source]({% pst 2015/dec/2015-12-22-why-dont-you-contribute-to-open-source %}) experience, no certificates
and no public work. Still, they are claiming that they are
[the best]({% pst 2014/oct/2014-10-29-how-much-do-you-cost %}).

We give them a piece of code and ask to refactor it. Just asking to make
it better. I think that this perfectly demonstrates who is in front of me:
[a hacker or a designer]({% pst 2014/oct/2014-10-26-hacker-vs-programmer-mentality %}).
We filter out a lot of people this way, who pay attention to
minor implementation tricks missing bigger design issues.

You can see how many pull requests are there already &mdash;
all of them are from our candidates.

## No Phone or Video Calls

Most companies are talking about diversity and equality, while most of them
will require a Skype video call with you, or at least a phone call before
getting you on board. How does this go along with equality? A face-to-face
interview is a very stressful process, even for experienced and extraverted
people. We can imagine how difficult it is for some programmers, who are
anti-social introverts, just like myself.

Video interviewing is a terrible practice, unless you're hiring a
stand-up comedian or a flight attendant. Programmers are not supposed
to achieve their goals by interacting with people face to face. Well, at
least in our [remote work]({% pst 2014/oct/2014-10-07-stop-chatting-start-coding %})
mode. We expect you to write code
and communicate via GitHub. Why on earth would we need to call you? We
don't do this and I think that's how everybody else should work. That's
what a true equality and diversity is &mdash; no phone or video calls.

## We Explain When We Reject

You apply to us, you spend time to present yourself, to talk to us,
to demonstrate us your skills and your profile. We feel that we have
to give something back, especially if we don't hire you. That's why
we always explain what is wrong with you. We are not
hiding anything and sometimes that information may sound rather
disturbing. You may hear something like this:
"Your quiz solution is not what I would expect from an experienced developer"
(I'm quoting one of our interviewers).

Unlike many other companies, we will never say something like
"Thanks for applying, but we decided not to proceed further. Wish you
luck!". That's shallow and ignorant. That's what most big companies
are doing, including Google, Facebook and other
["no evils"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_be_evil). Try to
apply there, you will see yourself.

Instead, we believe that an honest and straight negative answer is exactly what
our candidates are looking for, in case of rejection. We understand
that it's not the end of the world for you &mdash; you're going to continue
learning and improving. Our feedback will help you. So, why should we
hide it behind that polite "good luck" answers? We won't. You will
know exactly why you are not good enough for us.

Moreover, we are always trying to suggest the direction of improvements. We will
recommend what to learn, what to do, and how to grow, before coming back to us.
I haven't seen a single company doing that, in my personal job searching in the
past.
