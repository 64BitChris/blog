[Debugging] is a process or running a program/method interactively,
breaking execution flow after each statement and showing... It is
a very useful technique ... of a bad programmer. Or of an old programmer,
who is still writing procedural code in C. Object-oriented programmers
never debug their code &mdash; they write unit tests. My point here
is that unit testing is a technique that completely replaces debugging.
If debugging is required, the design is bad.

Let's say, I'm a bad procedural imperative programmer, and
this is my Java code:

{% highlight java %}
public class

{% endhighlight %}
