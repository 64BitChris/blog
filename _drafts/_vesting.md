Most startups don't have enough cash to pay programmers as much as
they deserve, [unfortunately]({% pst 2016/jan/2016-01-12-good-programmers-dont-work-for-equity %})
(or maybe not). Instead of cash, startups give their early employees
shares of stock, which they will be able to either
1) sell in a few years and become <del>millionaires</del> billionaires,
or 2) throw away. It's a common practice. The question, however, is what
is the right procedure and algorithm to transfer those shares to programmers.
When exactly they become shareholders? What is the formula?

There are many different algorithms.
