Conflicts is what progress is made of. A professional and well-managed
team loves conflicts and creates them on a daily basis. A professional
project manager provokes conflicts and make sure none of them end
up with a consensus. Does it all sound strange? It's not a sarcasm. Read on.

Have you ever heard the term "win-win"? Do you know what it means? I'm sure
most of my readers are not aware exactly what this is about, even though
it's being used very often. Let me to explain. In any conflict
there are three possible exists: win-lose, lose-lose, and win-win.
The first one is the worst and the last one is the best. Here is an example.

Say, your wife wants to watch a movie and you want to watch a
baseball game. It's a conflict. It starts with a confrontation of _positions_.
Your position is "I want this game," while her position is
"I want this movie."

The easiest way is to hold to these positions, no matter what. Very soon
you will get a scandal, a fight, and eventually a divorce.

Project management offers a few
[conflict resolution techniques](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict_resolution),
which can help you and your wife get out of this confrontation without ask police for help.
No matter which technique you use, the result will be either lose-lose,
win-lose, or win-win.

## Lose-Lose

Compromise is the worst outcome and it's known as lose-lose. For example,
you both will watch news&mdash;that's a compromise. None of you guys will
get what you wanted, neither a movie nor a baseball game. You both lose.
Who gains in this case? You neighbours and police, since there will be no
fight. Will the problem be really solved? Not really. You both will hate
each other even more, because both your desires were not satisfied. The
divorce will just get a bit closer.

The same happens in software team conflicts&mdash;if and when we resolve
them through compromises everybody suffers, except that management
and HR monkeys, who only care about peaceful office environment. They don't
want to see us fighting over a piece of a damn Java code. Moreover, they
don't really understand what the fight is about. They know nothing
about that Singleton design pattern and can't understand why these guys
are almost ready to kill each other just because one of them says
it's a pattern, and the other one calls it anti-pattern, insists
that the project must not use it, and threatens everybody with an immediate
discharge if they don't listen.

Such a fight freaks everybody out. Everybody, who sees positions and doesn't
see _interests_. Remember, the position is "I want to see the movie" and
"I want to use a Singleton." The only thing that a confrontation of
positions can produce is a fight and the only solution is a compromise:
"You guys need a good team building party, so that you become friends
and lose <del>balls</del> an ability to fight." That's what that management
and HR monkeys build: teams. The believe that when the team is "strong,"
there will be no fights, no conflicts, no arguments, no design patterns,
no anti-patterns, and... no senior developers. There will be just one
permanent compromise over everything.

In a family compromises lead to divorces. In software teams best talents
just leave. They simply don't want to see their interests being disrespected
all the time, just for sake of avoiding fights. Stay away from compromises,
they are pure evil for a family and a team.

## Win-Lose

The second option, which is a bit better than a compromise is to use force:
"I'm a man, you do what I say, we will watch the game!" or
"I fill sick, let me watch a movie." In either case, one of you will
get what he or she initially wanted. Even though this approach looks
less "democratic", it's way more effective, mostly because
it doesn't involve any third parties: there is no interests of
police or neighbours involved and the family resolves the conflict internally
and naturally.

Both of you understand exactly why you're watching that game now: because
the male part of the family is physically stronger. Even though it may sound
super annoying to you, my Californian readers, such a family would be way
further from a divorce than the one that used to make compromises, especially
if the winning party is not always the same.

If your software team has a <del>moronic</del> experienced architect, you will
most likely work in this confict resolution model. He or she will make decisions
and you will have to go along. I wrote about such an architect
[here]({% pst 2016/jul/2016-07-21-convince-me %})
and [here]({% pst 2014/oct/2014-10-12-who-is-software-architect %}).
I said there that an architect must be a dictator, making decisions and taking
full responsibility for them.

If the architect is super smart, respected by everybody and immortal this
force-based conflict resolution technique will work perfectly. The project
will move forward fast, since everybody will work instead of thinking. There
will be only one person that thinks&mdash;the architect.

The main drawback of this Win-Lose approach is the "Lose" part: someone
is always losing. And it's not about an offense, even though it's also important,
but about us missing some valuable information. You will never know why
your wife wanted to watch that movie or why that junior developer
was suggesting to use NoSQL instead of SQL. You will just force them both
to shut up and follow your will. They did, but you "lost" something. So,
basically it's the team who is losing something, not just your wife or that
junior developer.

## Win-Win

The most difficult and the most effective way to resolve a conflict is to
collaborate in order to discover interests of all parties and find
a solution that satisfies them all. You start with "Why do you want to
watch that movie?" to learn what exactly is behind that aggressive
"I want the movie" position. Again, there is a huge difference between
a position and an interest.

You may hear this back: "I'm just tired." So, the real interest is to relax,
not to watch the movie. The movie was just one of the options to get rest.
Now, knowing her real interest you may come up with "How about I watch
the game doing massage to you at the same time?" The divorce may never happen.

Thus, the first important step is to help everybody abandon their _positions_
and honestly expose their _interests_. When it's done, we all start to work
not against each other, but against a problem: with what solution all our
interests can be satisfied at the same time?

We will ask that junior developer: "Why do you think we need NoSQL?" It's
very likely that we will hear something like "I just want to learn this new
concept." This is his real interest&mdash;to learn something new while
working in this project. Maybe we can offer him some other technology to
learn? Maybe we can move him to another project, where NoSQL is used? There
are many options. But the first step is to understand what did he really
want. Not what position did he take, but what was his real motivation for it.

A truly professional software team is full of conflicts, which are always
being resolved by collaboration. The team is not afraid of conflicts. Instead,
it _welcomes_ them, because they help reveal real interests of all parties
involved and make a lot of information visible and available.

Truly professional team players always try to _provoke_ conflicts, to get
an opportunity to resolve them through collaboration, exiting through the Win-Win door.
That's how the team grows. Not by hiding conflicts and making compromises,
but by provoking them, making different interests visible and finding
most optimal solutions.

Be aware, it is way more difficult than organizing team building parties.
