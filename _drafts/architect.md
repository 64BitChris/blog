Do you have a software architect in your project? Do you need one?

Well, most agile teams do not define such a role explicitly and
work in a democratic mode. Every important technical decision
is discussed with the entire team and the most voted solution wins.
When such a team eventually decides to put a "software architect" badge
on someone's t-shirt, the reputable programmer gets it.

The badge rarely changes his responsibilities, though. After all,
the team stays the same and enjoys having technical discussions together,
involving everyone. In the end, a software architect is more
a status than a role with explicitly defined responsibilities. It is
a sign of respect paid by other team players to the oldest and the
most authoritative one. Right?

Absolutely wrong!

Obviously, an architect is usually someone who
has most of the knowledge, skills, experience, and athority. Of course,
an architect usually knows more than others and is able to communicate
his knowledge with required diplomacy and pedagogy. An architect is usually
one of the smartest guys in the team.

However, this is not what makes him/her an architect.

And this is not what the team needs. My definition of a software architect
is this:

A **architect** is the one who takes the **blame** for the **quality**.

You can replace "blame" with accountability or responsibility. Although,
I prefer to use "blame", because it much stronger emphasizes the fact that
every quality issue in the product under development is a personal
fault of the artitect. Of course, together with the blame he also
takes all the credit from happy customers, when the quality is good.

This is what the team needs &mdash; someone personally responsible
for the quality of the software being developed.

How this guy will delegate this responsibility to others, is his job. Whether
he will use his knowledge and skills, or quality control tools, or
unit testing frameworks, or authority, or coaching, or corporal punishment
&mdash; it's his business.
A project manager delegates quality control to the software architect
and it is up to him how to delegate it further.

The role of a software architect is crucial for every project,
even if there are just two coders working at the same desk. One of
them has to be an architect.

An ideal architect has all the merits mentioned above. He listens
to everybody and take their opinions into account. He is a good coach and a teacher,
with a lot of patience. He is an effective communicator
and negotiator. He is a diplomat. And he is an expert in the technical domain.

But, even if he doesn't have all these merits, **his decision is always final**.

And this is the job of the project manager, to make sure that every
technical decision of the artitect is not doubted by anyone. This is
what delegation is about &mdash; responsibility should always come with power.

As a project manager, you should regularly evaluate the results
of your architect. Remember, the quality of the product your team
is working on is his personal (!) reponsibility.
Any problems you see are his problems.
Don't be afraid to blame him and punish. But always remember that
in order to make your punishments productive you should give your
architect full power in his actions. Let me re-iterate, his decisions should be final.

If you, as a project manager, are not happy with the quality of the product
and the artitect doesn't improve the situation, replace him. Downgrade him
to a programmer and promote one of the programmers to an architect.
But always remember that there can only be one architect in the team
and his decisions are final.

That's how you get a chance to build a perfect product.
