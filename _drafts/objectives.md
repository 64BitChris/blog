  It is very important to understand who do you work for,
  your paying boss/customer or the project, and what is the difference.

We all have bosses. We have customers, who pay us for running
their software projects. They are my bosses for the time of the contract. I'm also
acting as a boss for developers that are working for [teamed.io](http://www.teamed.io).
It is obvious that a good employee/contractor is the one that makes his
boss/customer happy. But only a bad employee works towards
this goal. Trying to make your boss happy is a false target, which,
if being pursued, ruins the project. A professional employee works
for the project, not for the boss.

We all work in **projects**, as developers, designers, programmers, managers,
testers, you name it. The boss is also a member of the project. More
formally, he is a **stakeholder**, same as every one of us. Each stakeholder
has his own **needs** in the project: 1) Jeff the Developer wants to learn Scala
and to collect his paychecks every two weeks, 2) Sally the Product Owner
wants to attend an expo in Paris and also to collect her paychecks,
3) Bob the CTO wants to raise round A and to collect a big paycheck, etc.

The project has its own **objectives**, for example
"earn 1 million downloads, spending less than six months and $300,000."
This is what the project works for. This what all of us are here.

Our personal needs may be satisfied
fully while we all are working towards this goal, or some of them may
be sacrificed. I mean all of us. Including the boss, whoever he or she is,
either a CTO, a co-founder, a project manager, or a team lead.

The project is the one who is giving us checks. Not the CFO.

The CFO is a stakeholder, like everyone else. The project gave him more
power than others because its necessary for the whole mechanism to
work properly. Every project member has his/her own **roles and responsibilities**.
I write code, the CFO is writing checks. I'm eating in McDonalds, he is driving
a Jaguar. We have different needs and we both agreed that the project
will satisfy them. Otherwise, we wouldn't be here, right?

We're all parts of a mechanism called "project", which works according
to the rules and principles of **project management**, either we are aware of
them or not. Either we have a project manager or not. Even if we violate
all of them and manage ourselves in a total chaos. We still have scope,
cost, and schedule, and all other attributes of a project management.

A professional and savvy boss understands that his role in the mechanism
is to clearly define project objectives and make sure everybody's needs are
aligned with them. In a properly managed and organized project
everybody sees and feels how his/her personal needs are satisfied
when the projects achieves its objectives: Jeff learns Scala, Sally
sees Paris and Bob buys a new house.

However, if Jeff wants to learn Scala and we're
developing an iOS application, it is a problem for the boss to resolve.
Either convience Jeff to fall in love with Swift (I doubt it's possible)
or replace him with someone who is already in love. It is clear that
such a tragic act as firing Jeff a professional boss will
perform not because of his personal feelings towards Jeff, but because
they both are working towards project objectives. Jeff and the boss
will both understand that Jeff's need to learn Scala is not aligned
with the objective of the project.

It is CTO's responsibility to do something about Jeff when his personal
needs get misaligned with the objectives of the project that is paying
their salaries. A professional CEO understands it and
always acts in the best interest of the project, not of himself or
anyone else personally.

I believe that being a professional team player does two things:
obeys and resists.

First, it means that you understand that the boss is here in order
to help you to organize your time, your tasks, your communications,
your plans, etc. He knows more about the project and using this
information he helps you to do your job. Your real boss is the project,
the boss is just a hired manager who translates project objectives
to plans, instructions, schedules, etc.

The boss is your colleague that does management while you're
writing code. You're both equal. You and him are in the same boat. Your
functions are different that his, that's it. You're not working
_for_ him, but _with_ him, for a project. A true professional team player
feels himself equal to all other members of the project, no matter
how high they are in the hierarchy.

At the same time, he strictly follows the process and
obeys all project rules and instructions. Not because he is afraid of
being fired. But because he wants the project to succeed.

Second, being a professional team player means constant readiness to resist
each and every instruction, if you feel that they
contradict project objectives. A true professional doesn't work for a boss.
He doesn't want to make the boss happy. He actually doesn't care whether the
boss is happy or not. He knows that the real boss is the project and tries
to make the project successful and... happy.

A true professional always works for himself. Jeff wants to learn Scala
and to earn certain amount of cash. He joined the project in order to satisfy these
needs. If the project fails, Jeff won't get the money and won't learn Scala.
And now the boss tells Jeff to do something that may jeopardize the
project success. Will Jeff do it? Does he care about disappointing the boss?
Absolutely not. All he cares about is project success, which means his
personal success.

Thus, making your boss happy is a goal for immature, fearsome, lazy and weak.
Making your project successful is an objective for a professional,
strong, mature and brave team players.
