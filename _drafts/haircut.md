I was doing a haircut today and a hairdresser was trying to be nice
with me. He was asking, how did I want it, what size of the clipper
he should use, how long should sides be and how much he should remove
on the front. He also offered me many types of shampoo and a cup of tea.
All this reminded me the work of us programmers and I
decided to write a short post about it. I already
[mentioned before]({% pst 2015/jan/2015-01-26-happy-boss-false-objective %})
that trying to make a customer happy is a false objective. This hairdresser
was a perfect illustrative example of this very mistake. By the way, in the end,
I wasn't happy and he got no tips. How did this happen if he was so
friendful and nice?

I'm not a hairdresser and I have very little understanding of how to deal
with hair. I came to him because I assumed that he knows more about this
business than myself. I've chosen him in Yelp. Now I want _him_ to tell me
how long should be the hair on the sides and how much should be removed on the
top. I'm expecting _him_ to give me his professional judgement and stand for it.

Instead of asking me how much do I want to remove on the sides he should have
been telling me that there should be less on the sides. This is what
a true professional would do. A true professional would give me _his_ vision
of the best haircut suitable for me and would try to convince me that
it was the best choice.

A true professional would not ask me, but would _tell_ me instead. Because
he would understand that my goal was not to boss him and make him do my
hairs the way I wanted it. My goal was to get the best out
of his professionalism.

Unfortunately, the guy was either weak or immature. He didn't argue with me
and didn't try to convince me. He was trying to _please_ me. In the end, he
lost.

Exactly the same is happening when we're trying to ask our customers about
the technologies they want us to use. I hear this question very often &mdash;
_what language do you want us to use?_ (meaning Java or Ruby or something else).
Or _what database should we use?_ Or _how do want us to design this?_

Don't do that. Don't loose like that hairdresser. Don't ask your clients
what do they want. Instead, _learn_ their business requirements and then
_suggest_ the solution you think is the best for them. Then, insist and argue
if they don't agree. Convince them. Even if they fire you in the end for
your stubborness, it's better than being that hairdresser that is doomed
to please every single client without getting anywhere further.

Remember, the client is not the king, his hairs are.
