  It is mission critical, in a software team, to
  define explicit vertical lines of subordination,
  to prevent... chaos.

I stongly believe that while it is very effective to structure
an organization in a democratic and sociocratic way, a project
should be managed differently, completely.
A project should resemble a dictatorship, authoritarianism or a military hierarchy,
with a single strong result-oriented leader, who is giving explicit orders,
which are never doubted by subordinates.

According to Wikipedia at the time of writing, **holacracy** is ...
On the other hand, **autocracy** is ...

When I say organization, I mean a team, a startup, a company, that
sort of thing. Something with a brand, an office, a business entity
and a bank account. The role of an organization is very similar
to the role of a country or a government --- to provide security
in exchange for freedom. A democratic management structure
in a country, as well as in a team, guarantees **equality** to its members,
which is the most important component of security.

Holacracy, also known as "flat organization", technically means absence
of bureaucracy, special privileges, expensive furniture and private parties
for top management. In a flat team a distance between CEO and
a junior programmer is very small. They sit together in the same room,
they are eat in the same cafe, they discuss team strategy like friends. There
are no bosses in a flat team, only **leaders**. They don't give orders, they
inspire. They don't punish, they celebrate success and mourn about failures
together with everybody. Well, that's the idea of holacracy.
And it actually work, I've seen it many times.

However, when we're talking about **project** management, the same approach will
have catastrophic consequencies. A project is something very different
from a team. A project is a "temporary endeavor
undertaken to create a unique product, service, or result", according to PMBOK.
A project is something that starts and ends. The key objective of a project
is to **end**, while an organization's objective is to **survive**. See the
difference? A new mobile app, a conference, a new release, a round of
investments &mdash; these are examples of projects. They start and they end. We
don't want any of them to live forever, we want to them finish as soon as
possible, with a positive outcome.

A project must be managed by an authoritative person, who gives orders and
has enough guts to ensure that the orders are obeyed. That person is
called a project manager. And the project will be successful only if
the organizational structure is strictly hierarchical, just like in a military operation.
A project can not be flat, or it will fall apart.

Since an object is a temporary endeavor, it doesn't give security to its
participants. And it doesn't take away our freedom. The arrangement is
different. A project gives us money and takes our time.



I believe that modern organizations should be
as flat in their management structure as possible, avoiding
bureaucracy. I also believe that project they run should be
as much hierarcical and authoritative as possible.

There are basically two different extremes in organizational structures:
flat and hierarcical. Both have their pros and cons, however flat structure
is a much more popular way to run a young software start-ups.

I'm totally in favor of a flat structure, since it removes unnecessary
beuracracy  , a flat structure means that, being a member of it,
you can't answer a simple question: who is your boss? Both in
technical and management perspectives.

If it's a technical solution you are introducing, you don't know
who exactly has a final say about its acceptance. In most cases,
you will have to go through a semi-democratic serie of discussions,
conviencing your peer programmers.

If it's a management decision, for example, about an appraisal of
your performance, you don't know exactly how it is measured and by who.
Most companies even practice group appraisals, where almost everybody
give you their kudos which build up a summary performance rating.

My experience tells me that an absence of explicit hierarcial
definition of roles and responsibilities turns a possibly productive
software team into a degraded and unmotivated mess. More generally
speaking, an absence of group rules is a huge danger.

Let me show a few stories happened with me and my friends over
the last few years. Also, I'll try to summarize each of them with
lessons learned.

Yeah, before
