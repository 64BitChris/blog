  It is mission critical, in a software team, to
  define explicit vertical lines of subordination,
  to prevent... chaos.

I stongly believe that while it is very effective to structure
an organization in a democratic and sociocratic way, a project
should be managed differently, completely.
A project should resemble a dictatorship, authoritarianism or a military hierarchy,
with a single strong result-oriented leader, who is giving explicit orders,
which are never doubted by subordinates, and an explicitly defined hierarchy.

According to Wikipedia at the time of writing,
[**holacracy**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holacracy) is when
"authority and decision-making are distributed", while,
on the other hand,
[**autocracy**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autocracy) is when
"supreme power is concentrated in the hands of one person".

When I say organization, I mean a team, a startup, a company, that
sort of thing. Something with a brand, an office, a business entity
and a bank account. The role of an organization is very similar
to the role of a country or a government --- to provide security
in exchange for freedom. Democracy in a country, as well as in a team,
guarantees **equality** to its members,
which is the most important component of security.

Holacracy, also known as "flat organization", technically means absence
of bureaucracy, special privileges, expensive furniture and private parties
for top management. In a flat team a distance between CEO and
a junior programmer is very small. They sit together in the same room,
they are eat in the same cafe, they discuss team strategy like friends. There
are no "bosses" in a flat team, only "**leaders**". They don't give orders, they
**inspire**. They don't punish, they celebrate success and mourn about failures,
together with everybody. Well, that's the idea of holacracy.
And it actually works. I've seen it many times.

However, when we're talking about **project** management, this very same approach will
have catastrophic consequencies. A project is something very different
from a team. A project is a "temporary endeavor
undertaken to create a unique product, service, or result", according to
[PMBOK](http://www.pmi.org/PMBOK-Guide-and-Standards.aspx).
A project is something that starts and ends. The key objective of a project
is to **end**, while an organization's objective is to **survive**. See the
difference? A new mobile app, a conference, a new release, a round of
investments &mdash; these are examples of projects. They start and they end. We
don't want any of them to live forever, we want them to finish as soon as
possible, obviously, with a positive outcome.

Because of this fundamental difference, a project must be managed by
an authoritative person, who gives orders and
has enough guts to ensure that the orders are obeyed. That person is
called a **project manager** (PM). And the project will be successful only if
its management structure is strictly hierarchical, just like in a military operation.
A project can not be flat, or it will fall apart.

Since an object is a temporary endeavor, it doesn't give security to its
participants. And it doesn't take away our freedom. The arrangement is
different: A project gives us **money** and takes our **time**. The project
basically says to all of us, its participants: "Let's get it done and go
our own ways". Having this philosophy in mind and understanding the motivation
of everybody involved, the PM must use instruments that have nothing to do
with what keeps organization alive.

An organization/team/company/family will stay together for a long time if
we value things like tolerance, respect, patience, equality and appreciation.

To the contrary, a project will finish successfully if we value completely
different things: discipline, subordination, awards, punishments, and rules.

To summarize my thoughts, I would say that a successful company combines
these two approached, being a [matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_management)
organization it promotes holocracy in the team and autocracy in
the projects it is working on.
