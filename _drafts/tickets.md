A team working remotely requires much stronger discipline than
a co-located crew sitting in the same office. First of all, I mean discipline of
communications. In [teamed.io](http://www.teamed.io) we develop software
remotely for the last five years. We manage tasks strictly through
ticketing systems (like Github, JIRA, Trac, Basecamp, etc) and discourage
any informal communications, like Skype, HipChat, emails or phone calls.
Every ticket for us is an isolated task, with its own lifecycle,
its own participants, and its own goal. Over these years we've learned
a few lessons that I want to share. If you also work remotely with your
team, you may find them useful.

## Keep it One-on-One

Each ticket is a link between two people: problem specifier and problem
solver. If it is a bug, I'm reporting it &mdash; you're solving. If it is
a question, I'm asking for an explanation &mdash; you're explaining. If it
is a task, I'm ordering you to do it &mdash; you're doing. In either case,
there two main characters. No matter how many people are involved in ticket
resolution, only these two characters have formal roles here.

The responsibility of the ticket reporter is to **defend the problem**. When I
report a bug, I have to insist that it exists. This is my job. Others
may tell me that I'm wrong and the bug is not there. They will tell
me that they can't reproduce it. They will say that my description of
a task is too vague and nobody understands it. There may be many issues
of that kind. My job is to do the best I can in order to keep the ticket
alive. Obviously, if the bug is not reproducible, I'll be forced to close
the ticket. Until the ticket is closed, I'm its protecting angel.

On the other hand, the responsibility of the ticket solver is to
**defend the solution**. When a ticket is assigned to me and I have to resolve it,
my job is to convience the reporter that my solution is good enough. He will
tell me that my solution is not sufficient, not the most efficient, and
incomplete. My job is to insist that I'm right and he is wrong. Well, of course,
in a reasonable way. Of course, in order to create a solution that will be
accepted as sufficient enough, I have to understand the problem first, to investigate
all possible options and propose the most elegant implementation. But all this
is secondary. The first thing on what I will be focused is on how to convience
the reporter. I will always remember that my primary goal is to close the ticket.

My point here is that no matter how many people are involved in the
ticket discussion, always remember what is happening there &mdash; one
person is selling his solution to another person. Everybody else around
them, in most cases, is just noise.

## Focus on Closing

Remember that a ticket is not a chat. You're not talking and spending time
there. You're there in order to close it. When the ticket is assigned to you,
focuse of closing it, as soon as possible.

Also, keep in mind, that sooner you close the ticket, the better job
you will do for the project. Long-living tickets is a management nightmare.
It is difficult to track them and control. It's difficult to understand
what's going on. Have you seen that year-old tickets in open source projects
that have hundrends of comments and no deliverables? It is a mistake
of their project managers and ticket participants. Each ticket should be
short and focused &mdash; 1) the problem, 2) a refinement
questions, 3) a short explanation, 4) a solution, 5) closed, thanks everybody.
This is an ideal scenario.

As soon as you realize that your ticket is turning into a long discussion,
try to close it at all cost. How can I close if the reporter doesn't
like my solution? Well, there are a few methods:
