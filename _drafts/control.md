  Command and control is what works in military
  organizations, but apparently doesn't work in
  Silicon Valley; why is that?

[Command and control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_and_control)
works in all military units over the world,
for thousands of years. Apparently, just recently, we found out
that the best companies are built on different verbs, which
are inspire, delegate, trust, lead, innovate, etc. The question is,
whether we really discovered something new that none of our
predecessors were understanding for ages, or something
else is going on.

We are lazy and greedy animals. To work and produce something
for someone we need two things: motivation and punishment.
[Carrot and stick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrot_and_stick)
was a dominating principle in management for thousands of years.
[The Colosseum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colosseum)
was built not because people enjoyed building it,
but thanks to a simple rule: good slaves ate, bad ones were beat to death.
A primitive form of command-and-control management was the most
effective at that time, both in civil and military areas.

Slavery became illegal in the 19th century, and
the simple rule has changed: good workers were paid,
bad ones were fired. 150 years ago in most countries loosing a
job literally meant starvation and sometimes death, so it was not really
far away from beating slaves to death.
Since a hundred years ago there were almost no mechanisms of
[social protection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_protection),
capitalists were allowed to do almost anything
they wanted. A bit more advanced, but still rather primitive form
of command-and-control was the best management paradigm.

Besides that, all armies of all times were built as hierarchies
with very strict and deterministic definition of responsibilities
and authorities. Since the time of Sun Tzu the external
strength of any army was ensured by its internal discipline, which
was always about clear and explicit chain of commands, rewards, and
punishments.

Situation started to change just recently, in the 20th century.
Three trends dramatically influence the balance of power between
employers and employees, masters and slaves, managers and managees:
socialism, computers, and education.

  * First of all, socialism is slowly taking over capitalism.
    Workers obtain more rights and protection,
    while employers lose them every year.
    Loosing a job is not a big tragedy for us any more.

  * Second, the complexity of tasks we are performing at our working
    places is growing, mostly thanks to computers.
    We are not as easily replaceable as we were a few hundreds years ago.

  * Third, we are getting smarter every year. Most of us know how to read
    and write. We learn faster and more. Partially thanks to Internet.

Thanks to these three major trends, it's almost impossible to apply
the same primitive command-and-control management any more: modern workers
are not the same as those who were building the Colosseum in ancient Rome.
We are very different. Our carrots and sticks must also be very
different in order to be effective. Still, giving us carrots
and sticks is absolutely necessary, because we are still lazy and greedy,
just like that guys who built the Colosseum. Just like them
we need motivation and punishment in order to produce
something for someone.

What management is doing now is absolutely evil and unethical.
They command and control, pretending that they inspire and trust. They
use carrots and sticks, calling them appreciation and
[peer pressure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer_pressure).
They lie to us that we are not animals any more and don't
need command and control, at the same time doing
[exactly that]({% pst 2016/jan/2016-01-05-how-to-punish-employees %}).

The main victim of this slick approach is our mental health.
A thousand years ago masters were physically damaging their slaves,
today they damage us [mentally]({% pst 2015/oct/2015-10-06-how-to-be-good-office-slave %}).
Which one is worse? Where are we heading?
I predict serious problems in the near future.
