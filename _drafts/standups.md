  development teams (esp. in SCRUM), even though it is a bad
  practice and should not be used by good project managers.

A stand-up meeting (or simply "stand-up") is
a daily team-meeting held to provide a status update
to the team members (says [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stand-up_meeting)).
In the next few paragraphs I'll try to explain why these meetings,
being so popular in software development teams, are **pure evil**
and should never be used by good managers.

I'm not saying that they can be done right or wrong,
there are plenty of articles about that. I'm not
trying to give advices about how to do them properly so that they
work. I'm saying that a good manager should **never** have daily stand-ups.
Because they not only "don't work", but do very bad, sometimes catastrophic,
things to your management process, being it agile or not. On the other hand,
a bad manager should use daily stand-ups as his/her key management instrument.

To explain what I mean let's look at management from a few different
angles and compare how a good and a bad manager would organize his/her
work.

## Information

**A Bad Manager Asks How Things Are Going**.
Going around the office asking how things are going is a great habit
of a terrible manager. He doesn't know what his team is doing because
he is not smart enough to define processes correctly. But he needs
to know what's going on because his boss is also asking him, time to time.
So, the only way to collect information
is to ask the team &mdash; "what are you working on right now?"
Morning stand-up is a perfect place to ask this moronic question officially,
without being spot as a manager that doesn't know what he is doing.

**A Good Manager is Being Told When Necessary**.
Managing a project involves managing of communications. When information
flows are organized correctly, every team member knows when and how
he/she has to report to the manager. When something goes wrong, everybody
knows how such a situation has to be reported, immediately and directly.
When a backlog task is completed, everybody understands how to inform
a project manager, if he needs this information. A perfect project manager
never asks his people. Instead, they tell him when necessary. When
someone stops to tell, a project manager fixes such a broken communication channel.
But he never uses daily meetings to collect information.

## Responsibility

**A Bad Manager Micro-Manages**.
This guy knows very little about project management and that's why
feels very insecure; he is afraid of losing control of the team; he
doesn't trust his own people; he always feels under-informed and shakes
when his own boss asks him "what's going on?" Because of all these, he
uses his people as anti-depressant pills &mdash; when they are doing what
he says, he feels more secure and stable. Daily stand-up meeting is a great
place where he can ask each of us what we're doing and then tell us
what we should do instead. He forces us to disclose our personal goals and plans
in order to correct them when he feels necessary. How many times you've heard
something like this: "_I'm planning to test X... No, next week, today work with Y_"
This is micro-management and daily stand-ups perfectly help it.

**A Good Manager Delegates Responsibility**.
Ideal management involves four steps:
1) breaking a complex task into smaller sub-tasks,
2) delegating them to sub-ordinates,
3) declaring awards, penalties and rules, and
4) making sure that awards are generous, penalties are inevitable and rules are strictly followed.
A perfect manager never tells his people what to do every day and how to
organize their work time. He trusts and controls. He never
humiliates his people by telling them how to do their work.
A great manager would say: "_You're planning to test X today?
It's your decision, I fully respect it. Just remember that if Y
won't be ready by the end of the week, you will be fired, as we agreed before_"
Why would such a manager need daily stand-ups? Why would he need to
ask his people what they are doing? He is not meddling in their plans.
Instead, he trusts them and controls only their results.

## Motivation

**A Bad Manager De-Motivates By Public Embarassment**.
He doesn't know how to organize a proper motivational system in the team
that's why he relies on a natural fear of public embarassment. It's only
logical that no one would feel comfortable saying "_I forgot to do it_"
in front of everybody. So, daily stand-up meetings is where he puts
everybody in a line and asks "_What did you do yesterday?_" This
fearful moment is a great motivator for the team, isn't it? I don't think so.

**A Good Manager Motivates by Objectives**.
Ideal management is about defining objectives and letting people achieve
them, using their skills, resources, knowledge and passion. A properly
defined objective always has three components: awards, penalties and rules.
A great manager knows how to translate corporate objectives into personal
ones: "_If we deliver this feature before the weekend, the company will
get extra profit. You, Sally, personally will get $500. If you fail, you will be moved to
another less interesting project._" This is a perfectly defined objective.
Do we need to ask Sally every morning, in front of everybody, didn't she forget
to implement the feature? Is she working hard? Will this questioning help
her? She already knows what she is working for and she is motivated enough.
When she finishes on time &mdash; organize a meeting and
give her a $500 check in front of everybody. This is what a good manager
uses meetings for.

Daily stand-ups is a great instrument to hide a terrible manager. To hide
his inability to manage people. To hide his lack of competence. To hide
his fear of problems, challenges and risks. If you're a good manager,
don't embarrass yourself with daily stand-ups.
