A stand-up meeting (or simply "stand-up") is
"a daily team-meeting held to provide a status update
to the team members", according to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stand-up_meeting).
In the next few paragraphs I'll try to explain why these meetings,
being so popular in software development teams, are **pure evil**
and should never be used by good managers.

I'm not saying that they can be done right or wrong,
there are plenty of articles about that. I'm not
trying to give advices about how to do them properly so that they
work. I'm saying that a good manager should **never** have daily stand-ups.
Because they not only "don't work", but do very bad, sometimes catastrophic,
things to your management process, being it agile or not. On the other hand,
a bad manager will always use daily stand-ups as his/her
key management instrument.

To explain what I mean let's look at management from a few different
angles and compare how good and bad managers would organize their
work.

## Information

**A Bad Manager Asks How Things Are Going**.
Going around the office asking how things are going is a great habit
of a terrible manager. He doesn't know what his team is doing because
he is not smart enough to organize the process and information flows correctly.
However, he needs to know what's going on because his boss is also asking him, time to time.
So, the only way to collect the required information
is to ask the team &mdash; "what are you working on right now?"
Morning stand-up is a perfect place to ask this annoying question officially,
without being spot as a manager who doesn't know what he is doing.

**A Good Manager is Being Told When Necessary**.
Managing a project involves management of communications. When information
flows are organized correctly, every team member knows when and how
he/she has to report to the manager. When something goes wrong, everybody
knows how such a situation has to be reported, immediately and directly.
When a backlog task is completed, everybody understands how to inform
a project manager, if he needs this information. A perfect project manager
never asks his people. Instead, they tell him when necessary. When
someone stops to tell, a project manager fixes such a broken communication channel.
But he never uses daily meetings to collect information.

As a good manager, inform your team what is the goal and what is important
for you, as a project manager (or Scrum master). They should know what
is important for you to know about their progress, risks, impediments
and failures. They should understand what troubles you will get into
if they let you down. It is your job, as a good manager, to inform
them about most important issues the project and the team are getting through.
It's their job, as a good team, to inform you immediately when they
have some important information. This is what a perfect management is about.

If you manage to organize team work like that, you won't need to wait
till the next morning to ask your developers what they were doing yesterday
and what problems they had. You would have this information earlier, exactly
when you needed it. You would stay informed about your project affairs
even outside of the office. Actually, you would not need an office at all,
but that's a subject for another discussion :)

Someone may say that daily stand-ups is a perfect place and time to
exchange information among programmers, not just inform Scrum master and
get his feedback. Again, the same argument here &mdash; why can't they
exchange information when it's required, during the day? Why do we need to
put ten people together every morning to discuss something that concerns
only five of them? I can answer. Bad managers, who don't know how else to
organize information exchange between team members, use morning stand-ups
as a replacement of a correct communication model. These morning meetings
make an impression that the manager is working hard and well deserves his
over-blown salary. To the contrary, a good manager would never have any
regular status update meetings. Becuase he knows how to use effective
communication instruments, like issue tracking tools, emails, code reviews,
decision making meetings, pair programming, etc.

## Responsibility

**A Bad Manager Micro-Manages**.
This guy knows very little about project management and that's why
feels very insecure; he is afraid of losing control of the team; he
doesn't trust his own people; he always feels under-informed and shakes
when his own boss asks him "what's going on?" Because of all these, he
uses his people as anti-depressant pills &mdash; when they are doing what
he says, he feels more secure and stable. Daily stand-up meeting is a great
place where he can ask each of us what we're doing and then tell us
what we should do instead. He forces us to disclose our personal goals and plans
in order to correct them when he feels necessary. How many times you've heard
something like this: "_I'm planning to test X... No, next week, today you work with Y_"
This is micro-management. Daily stand-ups is a perfect tool of a micro-manager.

**A Good Manager Delegates Responsibility**.
Ideal management involves four steps:
1) breaking a complex task into smaller sub-tasks,
2) delegating them to sub-ordinates,
3) declaring awards, penalties and rules, and
4) making sure that awards are generous, penalties are inevitable and rules are strictly followed.
A perfect manager never tells his people what to do every day and how to
organize their work time. He trusts and controls. He never
humiliates his people by telling them how to do their work.
A great manager would say: "_You're planning to test X today?
It's your decision, I fully respect it. Just remember that if Y
won't be ready by the end of the week, you lose the project, as we agreed_"
Why would such a manager need daily stand-ups? Why would he need to
ask his people what they are doing? He is not meddling in their plans.
Instead, he trusts them and controls their results only.

Let me re-iterate, I strongly believe that responsibility must be
delegated and this delegation consists of three components:
**awards, penalties and rules**. In a modern western culture it may
be rather difficult to define them &mdash; we have long-term contracts and
monthly salary. But a good manager has to find a way. Each task has to
be delegated and isolated. This means that the programmer working with the
task has to be personally responsible for its success or failure. And
he/she has to know the consequences.

A good manager understands that any team member inevitably tries to
avoid personal responsibility. Everybody is trying to put a
[responsibility monkey](http://hbr.org/1999/11/management-time-whos-got-the-monkey/ar/1)
back to the shoulders of the manager. It is natural and inevitable. And
daily stand-ups meetings only help everybody do this trick.

When you asks me in the morning how things are going, I'm saying that there are
some problems and I'm not sure that I will be able to finish the
task by the end of the week. That's it! I'm not responsible for the task
any more. It's not my fault if I fail. I told you that I may fail, remember?
From now, the responsibility is yours.

A good manager knows about this trick and prevents it by explicitly
defining awards, penalties and rules. When I tell you that I may fail,
you remind me that I'm going to lose my awards and will get penalties instead:

{% highlight text %}
- I'm not sure I can meet the deadline...
- Sorry to hear that you're going to lose your
  $200 weekend bonus because of that :(
{% endhighlight %}

Have you seen many project managers or Scrum masters saying such a thing?
Not so many, I believe. Yes, a good manager is a rare creature. But only
a good manager is capable of defining awards, penalties, and rules
so explicitly and strictly.

When this triangle is defined, nobody needs status-update meetings every morning.
Everything is clear as it is. We all know our goals and our objectives. We know
what will happen if we fail and we also understand how much we're going to
get if we succeed. We don't need a manager to remind us about that every morning.
And we don't need a manager to check our progress. He already gave us
a very clear definition of objectives. Why we would talk about them again
every morning?

A bad manager isn't capable of defining objectives, that's why he
wants to micro-manage us every morning. Actually, a bad manager is doing
it during the day too. He afraids that without well-known goals and rules
the team will do something wrong or won't do anything at all. That's why
he has "to keep his hand on the pulse". In reality he keeps his hand
on the neck of the team.

## Motivation

**A Bad Manager De-Motivates By Public Embarassment**.
He doesn't know how to organize a proper motivational system in the team
that's why he relies on a natural fear of public embarassment. It's only
logical that no one would feel comfortable saying "_I forgot it_"
in front of everybody. So, daily stand-up meetings is where he puts
everybody in a line and asks "_What did you do yesterday?_" This
fearful moment is a great motivator for the team, isn't it? I don't think so.

**A Good Manager Motivates by Objectives**.
Ideal management is defining objectives and letting people achieve
them, using their skills, resources, knowledge and passion. A properly
defined objective always has three components: awards, penalties and rules.
A great manager knows how to translate corporate objectives into personal
ones: "_If we deliver this feature before the weekend, the company will
get extra profit. You, Sally, personally will get $500. If you fail, you will be moved to
another, less interesting project._" This is a perfectly defined objective.
Do we need to ask Sally every morning, in front of everybody, didn't she forget
to implement the feature? Is she working hard? Will this questioning help
her? Absolutely not! She already knows what she is working for and she is motivated enough.
When she finishes on time &mdash; organize a meeting and
give her a $500 check in front of everybody. This is what a good manager
uses meetings for.

More to this, daily status updates in front of everybody motivate
best team players to degrade and become the same as the worst ones. Well, mostly
because they don't want to offend anyone by their super performance.
It is in our nature, to try to look similar to everybody else while being
in a group. When everybody reports "_I still have nothing to show_", would
be strange to expect a good programmer to say "_I finished all my tasks and
want to get more_". Well, this may happen once, but in a few times this
A player will either stop working hard or will change the team. He will
see that his performance is standing out and this can't be appreciated by the group,
no matter what the manager says.

A good manager understands that each programmer has its own speed,
quality and salary. A good manager gives different tasks to different
people and expects different results from them. Obviously, lining everybody
up in the morning and expecting similar reports from them is a huge mistake.
The mistake will have a catastrophic effect on A players, who are interested
in achieving super results and expect to be super appreciated and compensated.

A bad manager can't manage different people differently, just because
he doesn't know how. That's why he needs daily stand-ups, where everybody
report almost the same and it's easy to compare their results to each other.
Also, it's easier to blame or to cheer up those who don't report similar to
others. In other words, a bad manager uses daily stand-ups as an instrument
of equality, which in this case only ruins the entire team motivation.

<hr/>

Daily stand-ups, as well as any status update meetings,
is a great instrument to hide and protect a lazy and stupid manager. To hide
his inability to manage people. To hide his lack of competence. To hide
his fear of problems, challenges and risks. If you're a good manager,
don't embarrass yourself with daily stand-ups.
