A stand-up meeting (or simply "stand-up") is
a daily team-meeting held to provide a status update
to the team members (says [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stand-up_meeting)).
In the next few pages I'll try to explain why these meetings,
being so popular in software development teams, are **pure evil**.

I'm not saying that they can be done right or wrong. I'm not
trying to give advices about how to do them properly so that they
work. I'm saying, they should **not** happen, ever.

## Management of Responsibility

Let's discuss a simple project, as an example. Say, you're a manager and
you have a group of three people and a job to be done. You have to make
a presentation about global warming. Besides, you have a
deadline and a budget (a classic definition of a project, which always has
scope, cost, and time constraints, aka
[project management triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_management_triangle)).

What do you do in order to get it done?

First, you break down your scope into parts, defining activities that
need to be done. You organize them in a so called
[work breakdown structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_breakdown_structure):

Then, you collect estimates for each task. You simply ask your team
members, how much time will each task take:

Using this information you can calculate your budget and schedule:

You're all set. It's time to start managing.
