It is a short manual for you, my friend. I assume you are sitting in the
office right now, reading this blog post. Maybe you don't like
your office job, maybe you enjoy it and feel excited to be
close to your office friends. Doesn't matter. What matters is that
there is always an alternative to office slavery. I'm not talking about
starting your own business. There are people in this world, who work
for someone, without doing what is described below. They do exist,
as well as companies who don't turn employees into slaves. I really hope
you will find one, eventually. In the mean time, this manual is for you.

**Help others**.
Find the most stupid newbies and help them. No matter what exactly
you help with, they should rely on you. Show them where is the restroom,
recommend a good restraunt nearby, assist in IDE installation,
explain how the project works and make standard jokes about the worst
class in it. They must become your best friends. But not only them. Be
very helpful to everybody. No matter what is happening, every one must know
that you're ready to help. Ideally, they all must depend on your
kindness and readiness to save them from the
[chaos]({% pst 2015/feb/2015-02-16-it-is-not-a-school %}) around.

**Be the last to leave the office**.
Nothing annoys a manager more than an employee leaving the office
at 5pm sharp. It's a sign of disrespect. Don't you like it here? Is there
anything in this life more important to you than this job? There shouldn't be.
Demostrate it by staying late. Here is a simple trick &mdash;
just come later. The boss won't blame you for that. But always stay there
after everybody else is gone. Ideally, you should leave right after the boss.
[Overtime]({% pst 2015/jul/2015-07-21-hourly-pay-modern-slavery %})
is a clear sign of your loyalty to our mutual result.

**Don't nag**.
No matter what is happening, you should never criticize your direct upper manager. The
boss is [always right]({% pst 2015/jan/2015-01-26-happy-boss-false-objective %}).
Everything else may be wrong &mdash; the situation,
colleagues, suppliers, computers, the CEO, investors, the market, the weather,
but not the boss you directly report to.
The word of this person is the law. The boss is the God. Ideally, you should
be the prophet. No matter what the boss says, you deliver
it to others. And you must look like you sincerely believe that it's right.

**Attend all meetings**.
No matter what they are about, you must be there. Not just be present,
but actively participate. It's not so difficult. Very soon you will
start to understand what they are talking about and will be able to say
something, even if you had no idea about this subject beforehand. Eventually
everybody will start thinking that they must ask your permission in order
to make some decision, because you were at that meetings. Important people
don't write code, they attend
[meetings]({% pst 2015/jul/2015-07-13-meetings-are-legalized-robbery %}). Remember that.

**Turn down recruiters, publicly**.
Loyalty! That's what matters in a real team. When a recruiter is calling you,
raise your voice and explain that you're happy in this company and don't
want to change it, ever. The more people can hear you, the better. Also,
you can sometimes tell stories about offers you're getting
and how you turn them down. Your boss should be the main
listener of these stories. Why do you turn them down? Not because they are
bad, but because your life belongs to this company.
Loyalty is what makes you a
[good slave]({% pst 2015/jul/2015-07-21-hourly-pay-modern-slavery %}), don't forget!

**Don't take sides**.
It's just too risky. In any argument you can always find pros and cons
of both ideas, right? So, why supporting one of them? You may be wrong and will
lose respect in front of everybody. Why taking a chance? Instead, always
say that there are drawbacks in both options. That's what a wise man would
say anyway. There is no absolute truth in this world. That's why,
always be in the middle, and you will never be wrong. Well, until your boss
takes one of the sides. That's the right moment to agree and follow.

**Never ask for a raise**.
It should be absolutely clear to everybody that you work not for money. You
work for [the big idea]({% pst 2015/mar/2015-03-02-team-morale-myths-and-reality %}).
Period.

**Attend all social events**.
Birthdays, corporate parties, Halloween, Friday beers &mdash; you must be
there, always. Don't worry about wasting your life, you will like
them eventually. It is very important to demonstrate that you truly live in the
office. You are not just writing code, taking money and going home to your family.
Absolutely not! The office is your real family and you truly enjoy eating
pizza with your boss and listening to the his childhood stories. That's how
you demonstrate your loyalty, which is the best quality of a
[good slave]({% pst 2015/jul/2015-07-21-hourly-pay-modern-slavery %}).

**Point fingers privately**.
Don't say anything wrong about anyone in public. No matter who is doing what,
we're always a team, we're together. Together! This should be your main
key word when talking about results, problems and risks. You never blame anyone.
Publicly. However, when you're talking in the kitchen with a few most trusted
colleagues, let yourself go. Tell them who you think is the weakest part
of the team and what would you do with him or her if you would be the boss.
They would not be here already, obviously. Don't restrict yourself, but always
make sure there are just a few people who can hear you.

If you follow all these rules, you won't be fired, ever. Well, until
the company is bankrupted. If it's a startup, it will be bankrupted for sure,
thanks to you and people like you. If it's a big enterprise, it won't, unfortunately.
You will be safe and your resume will have an
[impressive]({% pst 2014/oct/2014-10-29-how-much-do-you-cost %})
"12 years in Oracle" statement. Well, that's an achievement, isn't it?

I don't think so.
