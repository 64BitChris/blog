How do you do that? There are many ways to punish them.
Some are more effective, others simply don't work. This is
not an exact science. I would say, it's an **art**. You must be creative,
innovative and very open-minded. You never know which way of
punishment will work with who. Some people respond to some method,
while others may completely ignore it. Of course, the goal is
to make them **scared** of **you**, their boss. They will obey enthusiastically.
Here is a list of the most effective methods :)

<!--more-->

Disclaimer: I'm using "he", just for simplicity of speach. Exactly
the same rules apply both to males and females.

**Use Your Voice**.
This, of course, is your best instrument of
[punishment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punishment). Make sure he is scared
of you. He must know who he works for &mdash; you, his boss. The rule
of thumb is &mdash; the one with the strongest voice is the boss. Thus, you
must be heard, you must **rule** with your voice, he phisycally must
feel your presence in the room. Even if it's just a Skype call,
your voice must sound stronger than all others.
Moreover, don't let him speak, if they he is trying to argue back.
You're the boss!

**Play Hard to Get**.
He is [guilty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guilt_%28emotion%29)?
Simply ignore him. Or, even better, schedule
meetings and don't show up. Or re-schedule, many times. That will demonstrate
that you're not interested in him any more. His frustration
will grow. You're in the office, having meetings with other employees,
eating lunch, laughing, walking, talking. You exist, but not for him.
He is dead for you, because he is guilty. He is nothing and is getting
[silent treatment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silent_treatment).
Then, suddenly, you attend a meeting! You will see how happy he will be.
He will literally kiss your hands. You will love that feeling!

**Make Fun Out of Him**.
We inherit this technique from a good old-school
[bullying](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullying). We all know how it
works. Select the one who is guilty and make him a target of your jokes.
In the office this method works even better than in a primary school, because
you're the boss and he basically can't do anything to you. He will try
to laugh together with everybody, but this won't help in long-term. In the
end, everybody will laugh at him. He will do whatever it takes, just to stop that.
He will obey any order you give!

**Mistakes Must be Visible**.
He is guilty? He missed a deadline? He deployed a broken version to production?
He forgot something? Don't resolve this face to face. Always make such things
public, simply to let others punish him. This approach is known as
[peer pressure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer_pressure), a very
useful technique. His co-workers must not lose the momentum and punish
him using [social rejection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_rejection).
That's why, by all means, you, as a leader, must encourage back-stabbing.
You will rise to
[power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_and_control_in_abusive_relationships)
much faster, if your employees are not only afraid of
you, but also of each other. Use their fear wisely!

**Late Night Phone Calls**.
Having a [personal life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_life)
aside of the office is not for everybody. It is a luxury.
You are not just giving it away. He must earn it. If he is guilty of
not completing his task on time, his private life will be ruined by your
late-light phone calls. He must remember that. It doesn't really matter
what exactly the calls will be about. Just make them somewhere around 11pm.
Your key message is this: "I'm worrying about the project, while you're
enjoying your family time!" Guilt is what you're planting with this.
He won't be able to ask you not to call him after work, he is not that brave.
He will try to please you somehow so that you stop calling him.

**Don't Check Results**.
This technique is close to "Play Hard to Get", but here you don't ignore him.
You do communicate with the guilty employee, but you don't talk about his
results. You discuss his uncle's wedding, his snowboard weekend, his
new bicycle, etc. But you don't ask about that migration to PostgreSQL he
is working on for the last three weeks. You are **not interested**. This is
a perfect method of demonstrating that you don't take him as a valuable
team member any more. The team doesn't need his results. The team can live
without them. You will see how soon he will realize who is the boss and
what it means when the boss is not happy!

**Bad Office Spot is a Great De-motivator**.
That's a classic instrument of punishment &mdash; worst desks go to
those who forgot who is the boss here. Obviously, the best desk is the
one where nobody can see your monitor. Give those to good people, who
obey your orders and don't argue with you. They are your core team. They
support you as a leader and they help you to rise to power. Others must
sit closer to the door and their monitors must be seen by everybody.
As with all other techniques, [conceal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_manipulation)
your intentions &mdash; you
locate people in the office due to their job descriptions, to help
them communicate effectively. Everybody will understand what really is going on,
but you must look as a
[laissez-faire leader](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leadership_style#Laissez-faire).

**Easy Tasks Are Rewards**.
You decide who does what, you distribute tasks and projects &mdash; that's your
instrument of power. Easy-to-do tasks is how you reward those who are loyal
and supportive. They complete such tasks, hardly spending any efforts. Complex
and risky projects you assign to your guilty employee. He most likely will
fail and there won't be anyone to blame &mdash; it's just a project, like
all others. Boring, ambiguous, unclear, unnecessary, under-funded, and routine
tasks &mdash; they all go to the employee who deserves punishment. Of course,
you must look unbiased &mdash; be very polite and supportive, act as if you're
a good friend!

**Spread Rumors**.
Simply show your annoyance of his bad results, but not to his face. Talk
about his performance with his co-workers. They must know that you're not
happy. More to this, they must suspect that you're thinking about
terminating his contract. Don't say it straight! But don't deny, if they
ask. I doubt they will ask, but anyway. Very soon these rumors will
reach his ear and he will do whatever it takes just to hear that you're
not thinking about termination any more. He will be scared to ask you directly.
But if he will ask, deny it. He will be afraid of you anyway. That will
make him much more manageable!

**Overtime**.
Leaving the office at 5pm is a luxury. Only the best employees can afford it.
Ideally, everybody must ask you before they leave. The one who feels
guilty won't be comfortable asking you whether he can leave at 5pm. He will
stay longer, just because he is afraid to ask. That's exactly what you need!
Just to earn an ability to ask whether it's possible to leave the office
he will work harder. The question is how to make them ask your permissions
to go home. I would recommend you to stay late and schedule
interesting meetings at 6pm. Of course, you will come at 1pm, while
everybody else must be there at 9am sharp. The point is that you must be
in the office when they leave and you must do something important. They will
be afraid to disappoint you by showing ignorance. They will ask for permission.
That's what you need!

This list is definitely not exhaustive. I'm sure there are many
more [interesting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychopathy)
methods and technologies. Don't hesitate to
share them, below in comments. As I said above, I believe, this is
an art, not a science.
