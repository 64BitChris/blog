How do you do that? There are many ways to punish your employees.
Some of them are more effective, others simply don't work. This is
not an exact science. I would say, it's an art. You must be creative,
innovative and very open-minded. You never know which way of
punishment will work with who. Some people respond to one method,
while others may completely ignore it. Of course, the goal is to
hurt as much as possible. That's what a good punishment is about.
Here is a list of the most effective methods, according to my
management experience.

**Use Your Voice**.
This, of course, is your best instrument. Make sure they are scared
of you. They must know who they work for &mdash; you. The rule
of thumb is &mdash; the one with the strongest voice is the boss. You
must be heard, you must rule with your voice.

**Play Hard to Get**.

**Make Fun Out of Them**.

**Mistakes Must be Visible**.

**Late Night Phone Calls**.

**Don't Check Results**.

**Bad Office Spot is a Great De-motivator**.

**Boring Tasks Will Make Them Cry**.

**Spread Rumors**.

**Overtime Is Your Friend**.

This list is definitely not exhaustive. I'm sure there are many
more interesting methods and technologies. Don't hesitate to
share them, below in comments. As I said above, I believe, this is
an art, not a science.
