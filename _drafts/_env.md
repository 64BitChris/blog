I was asked in my [Telegram Group](https://t.me/joinchat/AAAAAEJFMRzsRTRxM3ec6A)
which tools and hardware I use in my daily work. Here is the full list of
what I have and even how much I paid for it. Maybe will be helpful
for someone.

{% picture /images/2017/06/env-macbook.jpg 128 %}

[MacBook Pro](https://www.apple.com/macbook-pro/)
Retina, 15-inch, Late 2013 ($2,900) with MacOS Sierra.

{% picture /images/2017/06/env-intellij-idea.jpg 128 %}

[IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) (<del>$499</del> free)
for Java projects. I've got a free open source
license from [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/),
because I'm an active contributor and
an author of [Takes Framework](http://www.takes.org). You may do
the same, I believe, just [email them](mailto:opensource@jetbrains.com) and ask.

{% picture /images/2017/06/env-sublime-text.jpg 128 %}

[Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) ($70)
for all texts I edit, including Ruby, JavaScript, and PHP code.
Also, for the blog and my books in
[LaTeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX) Sublime is the
editor I use. I was using
[TextMate](https://macromates.com/) ($52) a few years ago, but switched
to Sublime because it's just better. I also tried
[Atom](https://atom.io/) (free) and didn't really like it.

[Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/index.html) (free)
for web browsing. I also have
[Safari](https://www.apple.com/lae/safari/),
[FireFox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/),
and [Opera](http://www.opera.com/) but only to verify my websites
for cross-browser compatibility, that's all.

[iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/) (free)
for the command line. It's a replacement of
[Terminal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_%28macOS%29), with
some nice features, which I'm not aware about.

[Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) (free)
for package managing.

[YourKit](https://www.yourkit.com/) (<del>$499</del> free)
for Java profiling. I've got a free license from them, again because
I'm a contributor to a few open source projects.
[Email them](mailto:sales@yourkit.com)
if you want to get the same.

[HTTP Client](http://www.thevrway.com/httpclient) ($2)
for HTTP requests/responses debugging, when
[`curl`](https://curl.haxx.se/) is not enough.

[Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com/) ($99)
for editing vector graphics, mainly SVG. Also, it's good for
converting SVG into PNG.

[Pixelmator](http://www.pixelmator.com/) ($30)
for editing rasterized images, like PNG, GIF, JPEG, etc.

[1Password](https://1password.com/) ($40)
for keeping all my passwords in one place. I don't know what I would
do without this tool.

[Zoom](https://zoom.us/) ($150/year)
for conference calling and [Shift-M](/shift-m.html).

[Reaper](http://reaper.fm/) ($60)
for post-processing of [Shift-M](/shift-m.html) episodes.

[Things](https://culturedcode.com/things/) ($50)
for long-term planning.

[Tower](https://www.git-tower.com/) ($79)
for visual Git manipulations.

[Transmit](https://panic.com/transmit/) ($34)
for FTP and AWS S3 file management.

[ÂµTorrent](http://www.utorrent.com/) (free)
for stealing movies. I find them mostly at
[rutracker.org](http://rutracker.org/forum/index.php) or
[The Pirate Bay](https://piratebay.to/).

[VLC](http://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html) (free)
for watching stolen movies.

[Vienna](http://www.vienna-rss.com/) (free)
for reading RSS feeds, rarely.

[Keynote](https://www.apple.com/lae/keynote/) for presentations,
[Pages](https://www.apple.com/lae/pages/) for documents sometimes,
and [Numbers](https://www.apple.com/lae/numbers/) for spreadsheets.
I don't remember me paying for them, but maybe I just forgot.

[Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/personal) (free),
[iCloud](https://www.icloud.com/) ($1/mo),
and [Google Drive](https://www.google.com/drive/) for storage.
I try to keep as little as possible on my laptop and upload
everything that is already "history" to my personal
[AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) bucket.

[Telegram](https://telegram.org/),
[Viber](https://www.viber.com/en/),
[WhatsApp](https://www.whatsapp.com/),
[Messenger](https://www.messenger.com/), and
[Skype](https://www.skype.com/en/) (all free, in order of preference)
for P2P messaging.
[Slack](https://slack.com/) for business messaging sometimes.
[Colloquy](http://colloquy.info/) for IRC messaging when I need it.

[PokerStars](https://www.pokerstars.com/) (not free at all)
for playing poker before falling asleep.
