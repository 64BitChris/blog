I'm being asked this question very often &mdash; where and how to find
and hire a good programmer. Since I'm a programmer and I manage
software projects, I'm supposed to know the tricks. Of course, I do. There
are many of them, but the list below summarizes simply the most important ones.

<!--more-->

I'm saying "he", but these recommendations equaly apply to both female and male
<del>slaves</del> software developers.

**Ask a Friend**.
The best way to find talents is by reference. Who else knows software
market better than your school mate who bought a WordPress website
last year, right? He will definitely recommend you a good programmer.
Recommendations is the most effective way of finding contractors. First,
you don't need to worry about screening and testing. Second, you will have
a very good explanation of why your project failed &mdash; because your
friend let you down with a bad recommendation. Win-win.

**Hire Only Locals**.
Don't even think about a remote programmer &mdash; remote projects always fail.
Always. He will be in a different time zone, you will always have cultural
clashes, and his Russian acent will be annoying. You simply won't
be able to meet him every second day and whine about your project being
too expensive, too slow and too frustrating. Hire only locals &mdash; they
are much easier to manage and punish.

**Don't Offend by Lack of Trust**.
A professional and talented programmer will be offended if you ask him
to pass a test or prove some of his skills. That will demonstrate that you
don't trust him. And if you don't trust, you simply should not work together.
Trust is the most important thing in any project. Also, don't ask how
certain things will be done. He is the professional you're hiring and he
knows what he is doing. That's enough.

**Fall in Love**.
After trust, the most important thing is a personal connection between
you too. I'm not saying you must fall in love with your programmer, but
it won't hurt. You should feel an emotional touch with him. Otherwise, Java code
won't work as you need it. If you can't fall in love, you should at least become
good friends. Invite him to your home parties, go to movies together,
introduce him to your wife. All of this will seriously affect
the quality of product he is creating.

**Don't Specify Too Much**.
That's what Agile recommends and I second that &mdash; face-to-face communication is more
valuable the documentation. Don't write any documentation, don't specify
what exactly you need to develop, don't think too much about that user stories.
It's all in the past. Modern software engineers figure everything out
by themselves. Just let him be creative and communicative. If something
won't be clear, just call him. Remember, a Skype call is always better
than that boring documents which nobody knows how to write.

**Motivate by Value**.
In order to create a great software product he must be very **excited** about it.
Make sure he is excited. If he is not excited, call him again. Motivate him.
Talk to him. Explain him your brilliant Google-killer business idea again
and again. Till the moment he <del>screams</del> says "I'm excited". He must know what
a great value your product is producing for the entire civilization. And he
must be excited. Do I have to say it one more time? Excited! Are
you excited already? I'm excited.

**Promise Job Security**.
Even if you just raised $2K for your startup from your wife's step-dad, promise
your programmer a cloudless financial future. He must know that you've got
enough to pay him until he retires. A good programmer must want to work with you
forever. That's the type of programmer you need. You don't want one of those
greedy freelancers who always jump from project to project. You need a long-term
committer. That's why you have to pretend that you're rich enough.

**Delay Money Talks**.
Don't mention money for as long as you can. Ideally, ask him to create
a prototype first and "then we'll discuss your salary." A good programmer
doesn't work for money. He works for satisfaction. That's who you need.
You should discuss value, excitement, features, market disruption and
all other important things, but not money. Programmers in general are not
really good in money negotiations. Use that and exploit him for as much
as you can.

**Don't Negotiate**.
Eventually you will have to discuss money. Make sure there will be no
negotation involved. It'll be an offensive process and most programmers
are very sensitive. Just tell him how much you will pay and if he doesn't
feel that is enough, get back to the value/excitement/market conversation.
Do it again and again, until he agrees.

**Require Full Commitment**.
Make sure he will be fully committed to the project. Ideally, he must not have
any other projects and even any personal life at all. He must promise to be 100% with
you and your idea. If he is planning on doing something else, demonstrate that it
will offend you. Act jealous, like a loving wife. You don't need a programmer
who is interested in something else.

**Make Him a Partner**.
First of all, making him a partner will save you a lot of money. Ideally,
you should convince him to work for free. Good programmers are good
entrepeneurs and like to take risks. A good programmer knows that
in order to become the next Mark Zuckerberg he must start with a
job with no salary. Give him some equity and keep that motivational speeches
coming. It's a perfect money saving technique.

**Be Positive**.
Simply don't tell him about your risks and concerns. The future of your
project is bright and he doesn't need to know more. You're going to be
his leader and a good leader is never too honest with subordinates. Always
be positive about the plan &mdash; he needs to get that from you.

That should be enough to find and hire a good programmer. Interesting enough,
I just re-read this text one more time and it looks to me like
"how to find a wife" instruction. Don't you think?
Anyway, did I forget anything? Don't hesitate to post some extra wisdom below in
