I'm being asked this question very often &mdash; where and how to find
and hire a good programmer. Since I'm a programmer and I manage
software projects, I'm supposed to know the tricks. Of course, I do. There
are many of them, but the list below summarizes simply the most important ones.

<!--more-->

ask friends

make sure he is local or in the same time zone

don't specify what to do - he should figure it out

motivate by value and make sure he is excited

don't test - it's offensive

personal click

commit to long-term payments

delay money discussions

don't negotiate - it's offensive

make him your partner

be positive, don't mention problems
