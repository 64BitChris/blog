[Micromanagement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micromanagement),
according to Wikipedia at the time of writing, is "a management style
whereby a manager closely **observes** or **controls** the work of subordinates
or employees". Everyone knows that micromanagement is evil, but what
could be wrong about closely observing or controling the work? Nothing.
Observing and controling is not what is so bad about micromanagement. It
is something completely different.

There are [tons of articles](https://www.google.com/search?q=micromanagement)
about micromanagement. Most of them emphasize that "micro" prefix is
about the size of the tasks being managed, meaning that a good manager doesn't care
about small stuff, while a micromanager pays
"excessive control or attention to details", as
[Merriam-Webster](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/micromanage) says.

It seems that in order to become a good manager one should just
stop paying attention to details. Huh?
What could be worse than a manager that doesn't pay attention to details?

Micromanagement has nothing to do with details being observed or the amount
of control a manager dedicates to subordinates. Instead, it is all about
**how** the details are observed and control is exposed. A micromanager
gives instructions while a good manager defines goals and rules.

A micromanager defines **algorithms** of achieving the result and insists
on them being implemented according to his or her will. This is how
a micromanager would sound:

{% highlight text %}
- Could you please stop what you're doing now
  and install Nginx on a new server. I beg you,
  don't do anything else until it's done.
{% endhighlight %}

This is how a good manager would delegate a similar task:

{% highlight text %}
- Hey, the server with Nginx configured must
  be up and running by 6pm. I count on you.
{% endhighlight %}

Pay attention how polite is our micromanager and how rude is a good manager.
However, it is obvious that the first one is extremely annoying, while
the second doesn't irritate us at all. Because it's all about how
the task is defined &mdash; as an **algorithm** or a **goal with rules**.

A micromanager treats me as a dumb executor of his or her will. A micromanager
is [**imperative**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperative_programming).
A good manager, instead, is
[**declarative**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declarative_programming). A good manager
declares what needs to be done, never telling me how I must achieve that.

BTW, surprisingly, there is a lot in common between management and
object-oriented programming :) A good object-oriented programming is
[also declarative]({% pst 2015/feb/2015-02-20-utility-classes-vs-functional-programming %}),
not imperative.

Thus, this "micro" prefix is not about the size of the tasks a manager
keeps under control. It is about what a manager wants to see inside them &mdash;
a black box or a glass box under a **microscope**.

A good manager doesn't care about what I'm doing now, what tasks I'm working on,
what are my plans, problems and risks. Instead, a good manager cares about my
**results**, to a very low level of details. A good manager pays extreme
attention to defining quality standards for my work, clearly explaining
expections to me, explicitly defining rules of failure and success. A good
manager makes the path ahead of me very clear. With a good manager I know
exactly what results are expected and what will happen if I fail or
succeed.

Thus, to be a good manager you should never tell your subordinates how
to solve their tasks. Instead, you should define what solutions and results
are expected. And, of course, what will happen in case of success or failure.
