You remember my blog post about
[_Why I Don't Want to Live in Silicon Valley_]({% pst 2018/dec/2018-12-18-silicion-valley-criticism %}),
don't you? Read it first if you haven't as of yet. The gist of it is
that Silicon Valley is a place with a lot of troubles. Noone should want
to live there, according to that article of mine, right? This is what
many of my readers concluded and they were wrong. Despite the problems,
the place is definitely unique and there are a lot of reasons why
you may want to consider it as a great place to live in, for a few years
at least.

I lived there for about five years and speak from own experience.

## It Is Rich

The state of California is the biggest generator of GDP in the US, almost
[80% larger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_between_U.S._states_and_countries_by_GDP_%28nominal%29)
than Texas, which is the second one in the list, mostly thanks
to Hollywood and Silicon Valley.
California [has more billionaires](https://www.forbes.com/sites/katiasavchuk/2015/03/04/california-has-more-billionaires-than-every-country-except-the-u-s-and-china/)
than every country (except the US and China),
and half of them live in the Bay Area and Silicon Valley.

You can smell money everywhere. Salaries are overblown: you can easily make
$150,000 a year (around $9K per month) being a decent Java developer. Being
a part-time software consultant you can charge $150/hour and it won't really
surprise anyone.

When you move there the feelings you get out of a $100 change: It becomes
of a smaller value for you, in just a few weeks of stay in the Bay Area. Along
with that, your expectations of your own financial results go up and you
realize that you either become a millionaire ASAP or your life is wasted.
For some this can be depressive, but for others it's a great push forward.

## Is Is Easy Going

Either it's a cultural thing of the entire America or something specific
for the West Coast, they don't tend to make long-term and tight connections.
"Nothing personal, it's strictly business," seems to be the moto of people
there. They do business with you, they may invite you to their houses,
share a lunch with you, introduce you to the members of their families and
then forget your name once the business is over. This may look cold and
rude to someone with a sensitive soul, but if you are focused on doing
business and making money, you will feel comfortable.

You won't need to build a sophisticated relationship before someone can
do business with you, like it happens, for example, in Europe. In America
they are ready to shake hands at the first meeting, but they are also
ready to walk out of the deal, as quickly, when business interested are
changed.

## It Is Work Focused

Try to visit any Starbucks in the Bay Area, at, say 11pm (if it's open).
There will be many people (if not most of them) with laptops. I haven't
seen anything like that in any place in the world and I've been in dozens
of them. Americans work and they work a lot. How productive they are---it's
a different question

## It Is Smart


## It Is Comfortable

Climate

Roads, parking, spaces

Public transport

## It Is Democratic

No big visual differences between poor and rich

No need to dress up

## It Is Immigrant-Friendly

## It Is Healthy

## It Is Motivating
