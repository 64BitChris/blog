A friend of mine, a few days ago over a cup of tea:
"I've spent over $300K, they were writing this app for over
a year, idiots." Me: "Now what?" Him: "I don't know. I will most
probably raise more money and we will continue." Me: "What's with the app?"
Him, sadly: "It's not ready yeat, many things have to be changed,
we need more time and money." Me: "I'm sorry to hear this."

Am I really sorry? Yes, I'm. But more than sorry I'm jealous. I envy
those lucky bastards who robbed the guy for $300K. I frequently ask
myself, how do they manage to do it. It's a combination of tricks, I believe.

What did I recomment my friend? There is nothing to recommend, he is just
yet another loser, who has been ripped off by my tech colleagues. He lost.
It's the end of story.
I can only try to help those who still have got some cash and a dream
to become the next WhatApp or Twitter founder.

**TL;DR** You will _loose_, don't do it.

Here is why (my short list of reasons and pitfalls):

**Don't Spend More Than a Month**.
Some say [12 weeks](http://12weekmvp.com/process.html), I say a month.
And I'm [not alone](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/the-developers-workflow-in-practice-how-we-built-our-mvp-in-30-days-c60d804695a8).
Do you know that the first version of Minecraft (which was later
[sold](https://mojang.com/2014/09/yes-were-being-bought-by-microsoft/)
to Microsoft for $2.5B) was released in just [six](https://www.techradar.com/news/the-history-of-minecraft)
days? There are many other examples, including Uber, DropBox,
[Buffer](https://blog.bufferapp.com/idea-to-paying-customers-in-7-weeks-how-we-did-it),
and
[others](https://hackernoon.com/this-will-change-the-way-you-build-a-mvp-minimum-viable-product-in-2017-99daabb4bf1b).
Eric Reis in his book
[_Lean Startup_](https://www.amazon.com/Lean-Startup-Entrepreneurs-Continuous-Innovation-ebook/dp/B004J4XGN6)
called it a Minimum Viable Product (MVP), I'm sure you've heard this accronym.
If developers are promising you to deliver the product in a few months,
you are doing something wrong. You absolutely must get a working software
in less than a month and it has to be ready for real paying users. Most
of my [pet projects](/pets.html) I created in less than a week each.

**Don't Pay Salaries**.
Of course, they will want you to pay monthly, plus health insurrance,
laptops, vacations, and a nice sunny office. That's where your plan falls short.
Make them happy and you lose. You must find a way to align your objectives
(deliver the MVP as soon as possible and start making money) with theirs
(buy a new car and spend the next vacation on a beach).
Can you do that? It's difficult. That's why we created [Zerocracy](https://www.zerocracy.com), which makes
[incremental billing]({% pst 2014/oct/2014-10-21-incremental-billing %})
and paying by results possible. You can either [move](https://www.zerocracy.com/rfp) your
project to our platform and manage your developers there, or invent something
on your own. But remember, no monthly salaries! Only by results delivered.

**Don't** let them _experiment_.
Every smart programmer wants to use your new project as a test ground for
some new technologies. Nobody likes to do exactly the same they were doing
yesterday, unless they are stupid and boring people. Thus, your guys
will recommend you to use something new: a new framework, a new database,
a new cloud hosting solution, a new deployment tools. They are doing this
for their own purpose, not to help the project. Don't fall for this. Insist
to use what they have experience with, at least at the MVP stage. Promise them
a freedom to experiment, but later, when the MVP is launched.
