In September 2016 I paid [Coinbase](http://www.coinbase.com)
$1,223 for two BTC, $611 each. Seven months after, in April 2017,
they paid me back $2,490, which was $1,245 per BTC. My profit before
taxes was $1,268, over 100% of the investment, in just seven months.
Moreover, if I would have waited until today, I would have made
$6,800 profit instead. Actually, I still have a few BTCs in my Coinbase account
and I can make that 750% profit, if I sell now. Should I? The
BTC price is
[over $4,000](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/08/12/bitcoin-vaults-to-new-record-above-4k-boosted-by-japan-and-multiplying-its-value-fourfold.html).
Will it go up? Or down? What would you do?

Where did that profit come from?
How Coinbase can pay me eight times more now than I paid them less than a year ago?
Where do they get that cash?

Obviously you know what [Ponzi scheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ponzi_scheme) is, right?
If you don't, watch
[Episode 16](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1811261/)
of the 8th Season of
[Two and a Half Men](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0369179/).
In a nutshell, I'm getting my investment and my profit from other people, who are
paying Coinbase now for my BTCs. If there would be no demand,
my entire investment would disappear and I would remain with the BTC bits
and bytes in my virtual wallet. I would lose my $1,223.

Some recent articles call [Bitcoin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin) and other
[altcoins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency),
like
[Etherium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethereum) or
[Litecoin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litecoin), Ponzi schemes,
for example,
[_The Rise of Cryptocurrency Ponzi Schemes_](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/05/cryptocurrency-ponzi-schemes/528624/)
in The Atlantic
and
[_Bitcoin passes $1,000 but only number that matters is zero_](https://www.ft.com/content/b5d66ed8-d1b3-11e6-b06b-680c49b4b4c0)
in Financial Times.

Indeed, the key attribute of a pyramid scheme is right there:
the product being sold has no value aside from the demand-generated one.
Should we blame Bitcoin for that? I don't think so.

I think that what Coinbase (and similar traders like
[CoinMama](http://www.coinmama.com) or [CEX.io](http://www.cex.io)) are doing is definitely
a pyramid and must be stopped by the government, rather sooner than later.

Imagine, I start a company tomorrow. I will call it YegorBase.
It will buy and sell YegorCoins. The price will be $100 a piece. Some of you
may buy that, especially because some of you will sell them the next day,
when the price will be $101. Initially I will create some fuzz to promote
the product and the trading will begin. The price will obviously
go up every day&mdash;that's the nature of a Ponzi scheme.

Eventually the entire shop will either be busted, or go bancrupt, or both.

And the problem is not the YegorCoin itself&mdash;there is nothing wrong in
creating your own crypto-electronic-whatever-product. The problem is that I'll
be trading something that has a very questionable value, being absolutely
no regulated by the government. The trading of my YegorCoin,
just like shares of stocks, bonds, options, gold, and Bitcoin, must be
regulated by the people we're paying our taxes to&mdash;the police.

You may say that Coinbase is not issuing that Bitcoins and only trading
them&mdash;that's why it's not a pyramid. Not true. In my YegorBase shop
I won't need to issue my YegorCoins for too long. As soon as the total volume
of YegorCoins will be big enough, the situation will control itself
and the price will jump and fall somehow. I will make profit on trading
commission and the owners of YegorCoin will hope that they will manage
to sell everything before my shop gets busted.

Why the police is still closing their eyes on what Coinbase is doing,
I simply can't understand. Maybe because NYSE and A16Z are among their
[long list](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/coinbase/investors)
of investors?
