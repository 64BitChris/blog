We live in the era of organic food, eco-friendly toilets, zero-emission cars,
and harassment-free offices. Our management practices have to keep up&mdash;they
must be conflict-free, idiot-friendly, and zero-stress. If you're still
stuck in the old carrot-and-stick mediocrity-intolerant primitive mentality,
these recipes will open your eyes.


How to be a good manager?
It's not so difficult:
lead, mentor and coach;
harness energy and drive action;
never settle for mediocrity;
champion excellence;
foster sequential and consequential learning;
do with, not for;
recognise and reward;
listen;
engage;
embrace.
If this simple recipe doesn't work, there is something wrong with you.
To help you out, I will try to break it down to pieces.

**Positive Thinking**.
You must remember that keeping people happy
is more important than their results, effectiveness and productivity.
As an organic manager you must never offend your team with any
negativity or honesty. You must always balance somewhere between
"you guys are good" and "you're just fantastic." You must be their cheerleader!
Truth hurts and modern management is not about hurting people, it's about
making them happy. You must be a permanent source of good news, funny
stories, and smiles.

**Tolerance, Equality, and Diversity**.
How many [latinx](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/why-people-are-using-the-term-latinx_us_57753328e4b0cc0fa136a159)
are in your team? What about gays and transsexuals?
You're not sure? That's wrong. You have to count. You don't know how to
segregate bi-sexuals from normal people and black females from white males?
Well, there must be some "[mischling tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mischling_Test)."
You have to learn how to count and pay attention to the numbers.

and [others](https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/01/krablr-releases-first-diversity-report/)
already do. These metrics are quickly replacing outdated performance reports

**Intrinsic Values**.
[Trotsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leon_Trotsky)
[said](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Revolution_Betrayed) in 1937
that people would eventually work not out of greed or poverty, but because
they just enjoy it. He would be happy to see
that his prophesy finally
[came true](https://techbeacon.com/13-ways-motivate-software-engineers):
programmers don't work for money any more.
They [work](https://www.verywell.com/what-is-intrinsic-motivation-2795385)
for challenge, respect, curiosity, recognition, cooperation, and free beer
on Fridays. As a modern eco-manager you must stop humiliating them
with old-fashioned dollar bills and start giving them these intrinsic values.

**Responsibility**.


**Holacracy**.

**Leadership**.
