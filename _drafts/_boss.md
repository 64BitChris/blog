No secret, <del>we</del> you all have managers. Some of them are
great, while others are simply idiots. What do you do if you happen
to have a boss that perfectly fits into this dominating category?
Quit and try to find a better place. This may sound like a good
advice, but you know better than me that a new boss most likely won't
be any better. Don't quit. Stay. Manage the manager. Most of them are
manageable.

First of all, remember your goal: do nothing and get paid. It's hardly
achievable to its full extent, but you can get very close.
Doing something useful two hours a week and collecting a paycheck
for forty hours is what a professional engineer must aim for. The other
38 hours you will spend for your own projects, your open source
ideas, your education, your dreams.

The biggest problem at the road to this success is the manager, which
is hired exactly to prevent this from happening. Managers use multiple
instruments, to catch you and force you to give them your time. Here
is what I did in these situations against a really annoying
manager I had once:

**Tasks**. Believe it or not, he was assigning some coding tasks to me.
I was doing them very slowly or not doing at all. With a high
deficit of programmers on the market and my relatively good profile
he wasn't able to fire me. So, he had to put up with the fact that I
simply don't write any code, no matter how many tasks are assigned. Very
soon he gave up this idea and stopped giving me anything. I basically
created an image of a very skilled engineer who doesn't write code. No matter
how much you ask.

**Meetings**. At the beginning he was calling me to all possible meetings,
because he thought that I was very smart. I was even smarter than he thought:
in each meeting I expressed my opinions in a very aggressive and conflict-provoking
way. And I always had enough opinions to express. Very soon he stopped
calling me to that hours-long meetings because I was simply ruining them,
making strong points and never "being nice." Then, when he was not
calling, I was pretending to look offended, as if I was so interested
to contribute and they were ignoring me. Guilt is a very powerful management
instrument, you know.

**Reports**. Time to time he was interested to know what's going on, mostly
by email or in Slack chat. I always had a very long list of things I was
"working on," which was absolutely cryptic to him. He was not a programmer
and didn't have enough courage to verify my words. Any time he was
asking what I'm busy with, I was sending him something like
"HDFS reconfig for Docker image" or "Integration tests for JAX-RS endpoints."
He was happy to see that I'm very busy and was leaving me alone for another
week or two. Actually, I would recommend to send such reports to your managers
pro-actively, before they ask. This will make them even more comfortable.

**Morning Stand-ups**. Thay are annoying and very dangerous, because
other programmers may catch your lie about "HDFS and Docker." The best
defense is offense: I always acted as being very interested in what other
people are working with. I was always asking additional questions, making
them afraid of me. It worked, they never bothered me with their suspicions.
Try not to avoid that stand-up meetings&mdash;if a manager sees you there
they think that you're actually working.
