  Paying per time is a modern form of slavery, which
  must be replaced by paying by result, as a much
  more effective and healthy form of management.

What is the difference between a slave and a free man? A slave
has a master. A master, a cruel and ruthless villain, is telling the slave what
to do and punishes at will. However, at the same time, the master
guarantees food and a roof above slave's head. A slave understands
this exchange of freedom to food as a fair trade, while a free man
values freedom more. That's the difference. That's how it was in
Roman empire centuries ago. But isn't it how it is now? Aren't we
ancient slaves in our offices and in front of our monitors?

Partially, this post is provoked by a recently published semi-historical book
[**How to Manage Your Slaves**](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1781252521/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1781252521&linkCode=as2&tag=yegor256com-20&linkId=XUYP4NCA2TZVDHBT)
by Jerry Toner. However, not only that. The entire eXtremely Distributed
Software Development ([XDSD](http://www.xdsd.org)) methodology
is based on the first fundamental principle, which says
"Everyone gets paid for verified deliverables". Not for the time,
per hour, per week or per month, but for verified deliverables.
What is the difference and what all this has to do with slavery?
Let's see.

My point here is that any payment schedule based on time instead of results
is turning us into slaves.

Here is an example. Say, I'm a software developer and I need some money.
To pay my bills, to buy a car, to rent a house and to enjoy my life. I have
some skills for that. I can write Java software. I find a company that needs
my skills. They hire me and we sign a contract. A contract says that I have
to be in the office from 9 till 5 and I have to do what my boss is telling
me to do. In exchange, I will get paychecks every few weeks, which will
cover my expenses.

Doesn't it look similar to what I just said above about ancient slaves? The
master (aka CEO) tells me what to do, punishes me at will and,
in exchange, gives me food and safety.

The problem here is not about punishment.
This model of work makes me **think like a slave**. I think that this is a fair
exchange &mdash; I give away my freedom (my time) and I get back food and
safety. I'm a slave not because the master is punishing me and I'm sitting
all day long in fetters. Absolutely not. A slave is not the one who was
captured and imprisoned. A slave is the one who thinks that slavery is
a fair way of management.

Letting someone tell me what to do in my time and getting back food
is exactly what slavery is about.

What is freedom, then? How should a free man make money?

A free man sells **results of the work**. A free man cleans someone's house
and bills when the work is done. A free man drives passengers
from the airport to their home and bills when they get there.
A free man creates a software module and bills when it's ready.
A free man translates a document and bills per page. A free man
cooks a cake and bills for it.

A free man sells results, not time.

Also, a free man takes care of the food and security on his or her own.

Is it more risky? Yes. Is it more stressful? Yes.
But that's what freedom is about.

Think about it.
