  Very often a customer doesn't really know how
  software works and what is the best way to
  implement it; what do we do?

In outsourcing, very often a customer <del>is an idiot</del> doesn't
really know what he needs. Not only in terms of functionality, but also
on a technical level. What makes the situation even worse is that the
customer <del>very often</del> always thinks that he knows
and understands enough. The question is how do you teach a customer? How
do you train, educate, and help him? You don't!

The temptation will be huge though. You will think that the customer is your
friend. You will want to help him. You will feel very motivated to
make the product better. Moreover, you have the needed knowledge,
why not sharing it, right?

Wrong. Very wrong. On so many levels.

Most of all because the customer is not your friend. Not a partner, not a co-worker,
not a colleague and not a team mate. The customer is a project stakeholder,
just like you, but his needs are opposite to yours, and he is very well aware
of that.

He wants the project to finish as soon as possible and to take as little
money out of his pocket as possible. You want exactly the opposite. You
both work for the project, but from two very different angles.

Very soon, when the project fails (and it will fail, just like 94% of all
software projects, according to
[Chaos Report](https://www.projectsmart.co.uk/white-papers/chaos-report.pdf)),
the customer will find who to blame. Needless to say that
he won't blame himself; he will blame you.

According to the same report, only 7% of failures are caused by technical incompetence. Thus,
most likely your project will fail because of incorrect understanding of
requirements, poor planning, misalignment of management objectives, etc. Do you really want to
be blamed for the things you're not an expert at? Let the customer
fail, it's his project, his life, and his money.

Do your technical job right and stay away from everything else. This
is what true professionalism is about&mdash;focus on the things you can do
best of all and better than most others.

However, if you see that he is doing something wrong and definitely
requires help, recommend him hire a consultant. There are many people
on the market who can help him with requirements, UX, business analysis,
marketing planning, branding, etc. In most cases customers just
don't know that these people exist or believe that their services
are just waste of money.

Try to convience them that it's not true. But don't become a advisor
in something you don't understand. Your job is coding, focus on it.
