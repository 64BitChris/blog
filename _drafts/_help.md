  I'm getting a few questions every week from people
  asking for some help with information; I don't help
  them and here is why.

  - ask by email

I'm blogging and writing for almost three years already. A few times a week
I'm getting emails, and Facebook and Telegram messages, from
people I don't really know. They ask questions about Java,
management, object-oriented programming and other things
they believe I understand and can help them with. Well, my contact details are
published on the blog, in the header&mdash;what else I would expect, right?
True, but, even though I always reply to all of them, I never
answer their questions.

Why?

Because it's ineffective.

I believe that the more people I help, the better. The bigger my contribution
to the community is, the better; for both the community and me personally.
That's why I'm trying to answer every single comment on the blog,
on my YouTube channel, in my Gitter chat, and in Twitter. I'm spending
at least two hours a day for this activity.

That's why I'm asking everybody who is trying to get help from me personally to
go to one of that public channels and ask there. Then, I will find their
questions and answer. Maybe even somebody else will reply, since the community
is pretty big now.

When the question is asked publicly, everybody will see our conversation
and learn something from it. This would be the most effective use of my
time and the time of those who are asking.

Thus, no help will be provided privately, but all public questions will
be answered.
