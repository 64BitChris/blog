I want to create an iPhone app for my web service, but I don't have
programmers. Well, I don't have iOS programmers. And I don't have money.
Sounds familiar? What do I do? Right, I go to ~~Google~~
[Upwork](http://www.upwork.com) and find an awesome company in Bangalore,
which is excited to work with me, for ~~nothing~~ reasonable money. In
a few months and a few thousand dollars I realize that this is not exactly
what I expected. Yet another few months and I swear to God to never outsource
any software development to anyone. Is it just me? Not really.

This preamble is just a joke, but it's not so far from
[the truth]({% pst 2015/may/2015-05-21-avoid-software-outsourcing-disaster %}). Of course,
in bigger companies and bigger projects the story will be different. But the
outcome is almost always the same &mdash; it is
[a disaster]({% pst 2015/jun/2015-06-15-software-outsourcing-survival-guide %}).

I'm talking about outsourcing, not offshore development. The difference is
that in outsourcing there are two companies involved &mdash; you as a client
and some WeCodeLikeNoOneElse Inc. from Loompaland, while in just offshore
development you just open an office in the same Loompaland, with your
management and your employees. Again, below I'm discussing **outsourcing**.

Before writing this, I've read
[a few dozens articles](https://www.google.com/search?q=why+outsourcing+fails)
about why outsourcing fails. I've found a dozen of "reasons" of why. I think
that all are missing the point, because they are looking at the problem from
a paying customer's point of view. I will try to look at it from both sides
and tell you the ugly truth. A few paragraphs later. Now, let's see
what are the usual reasons.

**Cheapest Providers**.
Here is the argument: "You want to optimize costs, that's why outsourcing?
You will end up with the cheapest software shop and will sincerely regret
it, very soon." OK, what is the solution? Just pay more?
I don't think it's going to solve any problem, I'll
just burn
[more money]({% pst 2015/jun/2015-06-02-how-to-estimate-software-cost %}).
Also, I don't think this reason has anything to
do with outsourcing specifically. In any other business transaction a
"win-lose" scenario is a straight direction to failure.

**Cultural Mismatch**.
"You're in California, they are in Brazil, you
won't understand each other". That's why we have
[costs overrun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost_overrun),
[schedule slippage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_slippage),
and low quality of code? I don't think so. Moreover, my experience
tells me the opposite. Our programmers in [teamed.io](http://www.teamed.io)
are from 15+ countries and we've never had any cultural issues, in any
work conflict, which we have a lot of.

**Lack of Face-to-Face Talking**.
"They are far away somewhere in Poland, you rarely really talk to them,
that's why you misunderstand each other". Look, have you ever met me and
had a face-to-face talk with me? I'm talking to you, the reader of this
post. That's right, you haven't met me, but you're having no problem
with understanding of my point, just by reading this text. Mostly because
I'm making all possible efforts to make my point clear for you. I'm
interested to deliver my thoughts to you, and it is happening. In outsourcing,
the problem is not with the channel, but with the motivation. Read on.

**No Metrics to Measure Success**.
"You simply can't define clear metrics of success for a team overseas,
that's why your relationship eventually fall apart". Or something like that.
I didn't quiet get what did they mean by "metrics of success". But if this
is what I think, they are right. Success for a software outsourcing
shop in Kyiv is one thing. Success for you, a client of this shop, is something
very different. Read on.

**Poor Specs**.
"You can't make a good specification, since in most projects it's not possible. A bad
and poorly designed spec is a recipe for failure". Yes, that's very true,
but what this has to do with outsourcing? Ah, right, they are so far
away in Argentina and we're here in New York City &mdash; how can we make
[a good spec]({% pst 2014/oct/2014-10-20-how-we-write-product-vision %})?
I don't buy it. Inability to clearly and explicitly
specify technical requirements is a flaw of the
[architect]({% pst 2014/oct/2014-10-14-who-is-software-architect %}). Learning, training,
and reading is what should fix this. Getting everybody together into the office
is [not a solution]({% pst 2014/oct/2014-10-07-stop-chatting-start-coding %}).

**Leakage of Talent**.
"That developers in offshore are not your employees, they will never
be loyal to the project, the best of them will quit once in a while."
Yes, people may leave, once in a while. Again, how is it related to their
location? If they don't use the same coffee machine with the CEO, they will
be less loyal to the project? There are
[many other]({% pst 2015/mar/2015-03-02-team-morale-myths-and-reality %}) more effective instruments
to boost motivation in a team, than just co-locating everybody.

There could be much more, but it's enough for us. As you see,
I don't find these "reasons" logical. They are simply explaining the
consequences, not even touching the real problem, which, I believe,
sounds like this:

You're just a cash cow for an outsourcing company.

You're neither a partner, nor a friend, despite all your expectations.

Your goals are opposite to their goals.

All these "reasons" of outsourcing failures are originated by this
fundamental confusion that exists in our heads. We think that these
ten programmers sitting in Bejing are part of our business. We believe
that they are our team. They are with us, in the same boat, sharing
the same values, looking the same direction.

It's just not true.

It can't be true.

I've been in the shoes of an outsourcing company for almost ten years
(and quit in 2010). The ugly truth is that being a CEO of an outsourcing
shop your main and the only problem is how to take care of the
next month's payroll. 90% of your expenses are salaries
of your programmers.

That's why, a good customer for you is a paying customer. Not a customer with
a successful project. Not a customer with a properly solved problem. Not
a customer with
[optimized costs]({% pst 2014/oct/2014-10-21-incremental-billing %}).
Not a customer with the best possible
technology utilized. Not at all. The best customer is the one that pays,
pays a lot, and pays on time. Period.

That's the root cause of all problems with outsourcing.

The title of the article says that outsourcing doesn't work **any more**. Why
any more? Did it work before? Yes, it did. When salaries of programmers
were extremely lower in third-world (offshore) countries. For example, in 2001 we had
a team of very good senior Java developers in Ukraine. We paid them above
the market price and it was **$300 per month**. At the same time, we were
selling their time to US customers for $15/hour, which was $2,500 per month.
See the margin?

With such a margin outsourcing works fine. I was a CEO and I had almost no
worries about payroll. I had enough money to pay my team, even if we
lost some customers eventually. Let me put it this way &mdash;
I had a **luxury** to be
[honest]({% pst 2015/jan/2015-01-05-how-to-be-honest-and-keep-customer %})
with my customers.

Not any more.

Take another example, a good Java developer in Ukraine now earns **$4,000**.
On top of that, such a developer expects health
insurance, free gym, free lunch, paid vacation, paid sick leaves, etc. At the same
time, the price of Java time is not much higher on the market now. Even
if you charge $40/hour (which is very unlikely), your income will be $6,800.
Again, your income is $6.8k and your expenses are close to $5K. See the margin?

On top of that, don't forget about office expenses, taxes, computers,
administrative staff, team building events, etc. Because of such a small
margin, you will literally be broke if you lose a key paying customer. You just
can't afford to keep your programmers "on a bench" for too long.

Thus, the main and the only motivation of yours would be to keep that
cash flow coming. No matter what. The longer the project, the better for you.
The lower the quality of code, the better &mdash; more money for maintenance.
The more phone calls, meetings and other time wasting events, the better.
The more mess in specs, the better. Just do whatever it takes to suck
the money from the customer.

You will have to do this. Not because you're evil, but because you
have to feed your team. Your team. Yes, the team is **yours**. You're responsible
for their salaries, not the customer. In order to protect the team, you
have to go against the real interests of your customer.
You simply can't be in the same boat with him or her.

The point being is that outsourcing simply can't work, because your business interests
can't be aligned with the interests of your outsourcing "partner".
