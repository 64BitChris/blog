I [was asked](https://twitter.com/yegor256/status/977799130100781056)
on Twitter recently how is it possible to refactor
if one doesn't understand how the code works.
I [replied](https://twitter.com/yegor256/status/977966601227112449)
that it is "learning by refactoring." Then tried to Google it
and found [nothing](https://www.google.ru/search?q="learning+by+refactoring").
I am surprised. To me it seems to be the most effective and
obvious way to study the source code: refactor it.
