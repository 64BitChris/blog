You most probably are aware of the recent sexual harassment
[scandals](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/30/technology/women-entrepreneurs-speak-out-sexual-harassment.html?_r=0)
in Silicon Valley, which lead to serious career problems for
[Dave McClure](https://500hats.com/im-a-creep-i-m-sorry-d2c13e996ea0) (former CEO of [500 Startups](https://500.co/)),
[Travis Kalanick](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/19/business/uber-sexual-harassment-investigation.html) (former CEO of [Uber](http://www.uber.com)),
[Chris Sacca](https://medium.com/@sacca/i-have-more-work-to-do-c775c5d56ca1),
and
[few others](https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/news/2017/06/30/venture-capital-sexual-harassment-scandal/103336512/).
Let's try to put emotions aside and analyze what's happening
and what long-term consecuences this panic may have for our
male-dominated engineering environment.

We will never know what really happened between that male investors and
female entrepeneurs behind closed doors, but the gist of the accusation
is that the former were _making advances_ towards the latter,
where it was clearly _inappropriate_.

What does it mean exactly? What, for example, Dave McClure did in order
to be kicked out of the company he founded?

Let's see. According to Katie Benner from The New York Times,
he sent [this message](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/30/technology/women-entrepreneurs-speak-out-sexual-harassment.html)
to [Sarah Kunst](https://twitter.com/sarahkunst),
who was an applicant at his incubator in 2014 (other "harassers" were accused of
doing something very similar):

> I was getting confused figuring out whether to hire you or hit on you.

Obviously, he was flirting. What's wrong with it? Can't we flirt any more?
Is it a crime all of a sudden? One thing is wrong. It was a _threat_.

Even though this message didn't say it explicitly, it actually _implied_
that "you either go along and we go out or you won't be hired." Of course,
"no hire" may not hurt as much as a knife or a fist in the face, but it
does hurt. Especially, if you are a woman, a member of a minority group.

I'm a <del>sexist</del> [gentleman]({% pst 2017/jul/2017-07-04-sexism %}),
I feel bad when I see women being threatened. I want to protect them,
and I expect our system of justice to help me, just
like it helps when we deal with physical violence.
These threats or attempts to threat must be punished.

However!

There is nothing wrong with the game between genders by itself. Just
like we don't prohibit sex because we are afraid of rapists, we must not
stop asking women out because of our fear of a possible harassment accusation.
However, it seems that this is what is happening now: men are becoming _afraid_ of women.
Especially powerful men with money and status. They realize
that a small incautious step may help them become the next Dave or Travis.

This fear is destoying us.

Thanks to that fear our _masculine_ characteristics become a victim is this dangerous game
the society is playing now, with a nobel intent to protect women against
verbal and psichological abuse. We men are losing our self-confidence,
our self-esteem, our <del>balls</del> charisma.

This fear mentally castrates us.

We must be absolutely clear that those harassers are guilty not because
they "made advances" towards women who work with them or for them, but because
they were _threating_ that ladies. There is nothing wrong in being
attracted to a woman, no matter who she is: your boss, your employee, your
schoolmate, or the founder of the business you're investing into. Moreover,
there is nothing wrong in making advances, falling in love, having sex
and marrying them. Threatening them in order to get all that is very wrong.

Not every flirt is a harassment. Not every man with a sexual
instinct is a rapist.

How I would re-phrase that message to Sarah if I would be Dave and would fall
in love with her at the first sight? I would probably say:

> I was getting confused, figuring out how to isolate my hiring process
from the desire to hit on you. How about a dinner? I promise,
no matter how it ends, it will not affect our hiring decision at all.

I realize that it's is not perfect, since she wouldn't be completely
comfortable, expecting Dave's feelings affecting his hiring decision
in case she says she doesn't like him or simply has a partner. However,
this would sound like a respectful attempt to put the weapon down.

It is difficult to not threat a woman if you're holding a gun in your hand
while asking her out. Money and power is the gun.

Guys, let's be very careful. However, let's not forget how to seduce women
and fall in love with them. We have to stay men, even though
some of us are weak abusers deserving no respect.
