You most probably are aware of the recent sexual harassment
[scandals](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/30/technology/women-entrepreneurs-speak-out-sexual-harassment.html?_r=0)
in Silicon Valley, which lead to serious career problems for
[Dave McClure](https://500hats.com/im-a-creep-i-m-sorry-d2c13e996ea0) (former CEO of [500 Startups](https://500.co/)),
[Travis Kalanick](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/19/business/uber-sexual-harassment-investigation.html) (former CEO of [Uber](http://www.uber.com)),
[Chris Sacca](https://medium.com/@sacca/i-have-more-work-to-do-c775c5d56ca1),
and
[few others](https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/news/2017/06/30/venture-capital-sexual-harassment-scandal/103336512/).
Let's try to put emotions aside and analyze what's happening
and who is in a real trouble because of this panic in our
male-dominated engineering environment.

We will never know what really happened between that male investors and
female entrepeneurs behind closed doors, but the gist of the accusation
is that the former were _making advances_ towards the latter,
where it was clearly _inappropriate_.

What does it mean exactly? Is telling a woman that
she looks sexy and inviting her for a dinner is a harassment all of a sudden?
What exactly Dave McClure did in order to be kicked out of the company
he founded?

Let's see. According to Katie Benner from The New York Times,
he sent [this message](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/30/technology/women-entrepreneurs-speak-out-sexual-harassment.html)
to [Sarah Kunst](https://twitter.com/sarahkunst),
who was an applicant at his incubator in 2014 (other "harassers" were accused of
doing something very similar):

> I was getting confused figuring out whether to hire you or hit on you.

What's wrong with this message? One thing. It is a _threat_.

Even though this message doesn't say it explicitly, it actually implies
that "you either go along and we go out or you won't be hired." Of course,
"no hire" may not hurt as much as a knife or a fist in the face, but it
does hurt. Especially, if you are a member of a minority group.

I'm also a man and a <del>sexist</del>
[gentleman]({% pst 2017/jul/2017-07-04-sexism %}): I feel bad when I see
women being threatened in order to get sex. I want to protect them, just
like I want to protect everybody against rape, violence, abuse, etc. That's
what I'm paying the police for.

However!

There is nothing wrong with the game between genders by itself. Just
like we don't prohibit sex because we are afraid of rapists, we must not
stop asking women out because of our fear of a possible harassment accusation.
It seems that this is what is happening now: men are becoming _afraid_ of women.
Especially powerful men, with money, status and charisma. They realize
that a small incautious step and they will take the place of Dave and Travis.

What I mean is that our _masculine_ characteristics are a bigger victim is this dangerous game
the society is playing now, with a nobel intent to protect women against
verbal and psichological abuse. We are losing them, slowly.

We must be absolutely clear that those harassers are guilty not because
they "made advances" towards women who work with them or for them, but because
they were _threating_ that ladies. There is nothing wrong in being
attracted to a woman, no matter who she is: your boss, your employee, your
schoolmate, or the founder of the business you're investing into. Moreover,
there is nothing wrong in making advances, falling in love, having sex
and marrying them (or the other way around). What's wrong is threatening them
to get what you want.

How I would re-phrase that message to Sarah if I would be Dave and felt
in love with her at the first sight? I would say something like this:

> I was getting confused, figuring out how to isolate my hiring process
from the desire to hit on you. How about we have a dinner? I promise,
no matter how it ends, it will not affect the hiring decision at all.

I realize that it's is not perfect, since she wouldn't be completely
comfortable, expecting Dave's feelings affecting his hiring decision
in case she says she doesn't like him or simply has a partner. However,
this would sound like a respectful attempt to put the weapon aside.

It is difficult to not threat a woman if you're holding a gun in your hand
and asking her out. Money and power is the gun. Let's be careful with them.
But let's not forget how to seduce women and fall in love with them.
We have to stay men, even though some of us are beeing weak abusers
deserving no respect.
