  We spend tons of money on people that basically
  produce nothing, deliver nothing and contribute nothing,
  how about we stop doing that?

That's what a character of Bruce Willis, an actor, said to Robert DeNiro's
character, a movie producer, in Barry Levinson's brilliant movie
[What Just Happened](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0486674/). I second that.
Producers, recruiters, managers, real estate agents,
sales agents, lawyers, and [outstaffers](http://english.stackexchange.com/questions/103448/is-outstaffing-a-real-word)
&mdash; what do they all have in common?
They are middle man, staying between money and
[proletariat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proletariat), taking a huge percentage
for themselves, **adding no value**. Their very existence is our mutual
misfortune. We are too weak to get rid of them now, but sooner
or later every supply chain will be **mayonnaise-free**. Look at
Uber &mdash; taxi companies are dead already &mdash; we have only drivers
and passengers. A computer system is in between. The same will happen
everywhere else.

Seriously, look at **IT recruiters**, for example. To find a programmer one has to pay
about $30K (in Silicon Valley, if programmer's salary is, say, $120K/year)
to a recruiter. $30,000! What this money will be spent for? Or let me put it this way,
how much software will I get for this money? Let me put it even better,
why don't I give this money to the programmer directly as a bonus for
switching companies? Why do **we** need this recruiter between us &mdash;
me and the programmer I'm going to hire? Can't we use this $30,000 somehow
more effectively?

Because software systems are not powerful enough yet? Because I can't
find a programmer with a few clicks and I have to delegate this
searching function to someone, for $30K?

Well, yes and no.

On one hand, there is plenty of job sites and rather powerful
instruments for finding the right person.
There is [StackOverflow Careers](https://careers.stackoverflow.com/),
which not only allows me to find a programmer but also see what he or she talks about and how
high is the quality of that questions and answers. There is
[GitHub](http://www.github.com) that demonstrates the code written
by a programmer, helping me easily understand the quality of it.
There are professional certifications that show how strong
are the skills of a candidate. There are plenty of other instruments.

On the other hand, all these instruments are not used actively by
the majority of programmers and software companies.
Mostly because IT recruiters stay between us, **stealing** our money
and protecting that position of themselves.
Just like taxi companies stay between passengers and drivers,
or real estate agents stay between house owners and house buyers,
or outstaffing companies stay between project sponsors and engineers.

Imagine, there is no Google and you have to hire a "researcher" every
time you need to find some information. That's how it worked fifty years
ago. Not any more. Google solved the problem of information finding. It is
fast, it is accurate, it is free. The researchers are out of business.
Are we sorry about it? Well, maybe, but that's the way it should be.
The same will happen with IT recruiters and all those "agents". They will
eventually be out of business and will start doing something that
actually adds all of us some value.

At the moment, they are simply taking away our money, **exploiting** the
fact that we're lazy, or stupid, or shy, or you name it. For example, it was not obvious,
in the beginning, how to use Google. I know a few people who still don't
know how to do it. I'm sure you know a few, too. They would
rather call a friend when they need some information, instead of checking
Google.

Say, I'm a good friend and Jeff calls me asking what will be the
weather tomorrow in California. I will advise him to use Google, now and
every time in the future. I will teach him how to do it. If I'm a bad
friend and want Jeff to depend on me forever,
I will use Google to check the weather and will tell Jeff that it'll be cloudy.

That's exactly what recruiters are doing.
Their entire business is based on the fact that we're **not smart** enough
to use existing software systems, publicly available and, in most cases,
very cheap of just free. Or that we're **too shy** to apply for a new job ourselves.
Or we just **don't know** to write a good resume and emphasize
our skills properly. They are expoiting our drawbacks to make money.

A friend of mine was buying a house in San Francisco a few month ago. He
found the house in [Zillow](http://www.zillow.com) and paid $70,000
to two real estate agents helping him close the deal
(the price of the house was close to $1,4M,
2.5% to each agent). What did these "hard-working" people do to him for his seventy
thousand dollars? They prepared the necessary paperwork and, of course,
talked to him for a few weeks.

Can't we get rid of these two good-for-nothings and delegate their
operations to a computer system? Well, we have Zillow, but how much
did a friend of mine paid to it out of that $70,000? Almost nothing
(I assume one of that agents paid some pennies for publishing an ad there).
Is it fair? Instead, let's give $5,000 out of every real estate transaction
to Zillow and let it handle everything, automatically. Without any "agents"
involved. Can we? I'm sure we can and that's the future.

What will the army of real estate agents do? Well, maybe something useful,
like **cleaning streets**.

The very existence of this mayonnaise is our modern business environment
is a very negative thing. The money are simply not working the way they should.
Also, since this mayonnaise is rather expensive, its existence creates
a very de-motivating effect on those who are actually delivering value,
making much less income. It obviously demonstrates that the entire
system is deffective and simply not fair.

The same is true about **outstaffing** companies, which we contract to get
access to programmers sitting somewhere overseas, or much closer.
They find developers, hire them full-time and re-sell with a 150%+ margin
part-time or on a short term. I'm getting a few offers from such companies
every day.

They want me to pay, say, $40 for each hour, while a developer
sitting in their office will get, say $2,500 per month. This means that
$25 out of my $40 will be spent for **not writing code**, but something else.
Also, a programmer will be motivated for $2,500 per month, not for $40, which
is over $7,000. I will be paying $7K/mo, getting the software for $2.5K/mo.

I will be paying for a Mercedes-Benz S-Class, getting back Ford Focus.
I'm not greedy, but just want my every dollar to be converted to some value.
In this scenario, $4,500 will be simply wasted.

The same is true about every single middle man on the market. They
make business processes less effective, taking away significant
amount of money and slowing down optimizations and innovations.
A truely modern and innovative way of doing business is by **connecting
directly money with people**, who add value. There should be noone in
between, except computer systems.

Sometimes I hear that people love to work with people, not computers. That's
why we need all that mayonnaise &mdash; to make our life **happier**. That's true,
people love to deal with people, but with people we really need, with people
talking the same language, with people delivering us real value. Not with
producers, recruiters, real estate agents, sales agents, outstaffers, lawyers
or taxi dispatchers.
