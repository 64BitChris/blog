Software outsourcing is a disaster, we all know that. First, you find
a company that promises you everything you can only expect for your product &mdash;
on-time and in-budget delivery, highest quality, beautiful user interface,
cutting edge technologies and hassle-free life-time support. You send the
first payment and your journey starts. The team hardly understands your needs,
the quality is terrible, all your time and budget expectations
are severely violated and the level of frustration is skyrocketing. And the
"best" part is that you can't get away, or all the money you've spent so far
will go down the drain and you will have to start from scratch. You have to
stay "married" to this team, because you can't afford a "divorce". Is there
a way to do software outsourcing right?

<!--more-->

Yes, it is possible to do it right and truely hassle free, but you have
to be ready to twist your management philosophy.

The basic fundamental principle here is that 1) you should openly and frequently
communicate your **concerns** to the outsourcing team and 2) they should
openly and frequently communicate **risks and issues** to you. These are
two main success factors in software outsourcing, which are neglected
very often.

I learned this principle from Wei Liao Zi. He said,
according to [Military Strategy Classics of Ancient China](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1937021033/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1937021033&linkCode=as2&tag=yegor256com-20&linkId=S5KTMPGVOXPSCJN2):

Let me demonstrate a few practical examples of "software outsourcing
disasters" and explain how they can be avoided if you follow said
four-thousand-years-old principle.

## It takes forever and I'm over the budget!

It's always 95% ready. You always have something that is not implemented
or is broken. They've done a lot of work, you've paid a lot of money,
but a market-ready product is not yet there. It takes week after week
and month after month, the backlog always has something and you simply
can't finish this. You're starting to see this project in your nightmaress
and Prozac doesn't help any more. How does this sound? Familiar?

I hope you do realize that no matter what kind of contract you signed with
your software outsourcing partner, how many schedules you've baselined,
how many promises were made &mdash; they want to keep you as a client
forever. Well, for as long as you have something in your bank account.

You want your business to succeed and flourish? They want the same for their
business. Your success means a product that is finished and launched to
end-users. Their success means a never ending process of writing software
for you. These two goals have very little in common. I would even say
that they contradict each other &mdash; when you succeed, they fail.

Of course, they will tell you that they want to finish this product for
you and get new contracts in the future. They will say their primary
motiviation is to make you happy and obtain a good reference. They
will assure you that customer satisfaction is more important than money.
However, I'm suggesting to be strong enough to face the reality &mdash;
it's all lie.

The majority of software outsourcing projects fail.
Vast majority (see latest [CHAOS report](http://www.csus.edu/indiv/v/velianitis/161/ChaosReport.pdf)).
Software developers realize this better than you,
mostly because they see how it happens every day.
And your project is not an exception. Thus, let's forget about these
beautiful promises and focus on the ugly reality &mdash; you're on your own.

Having in mind the principle I mentioned above, here is my recommendation:
make sure the team understands 1) your real time and scope constraints
and 2) the consequencies of their violation. This is about the first
part of the principle &mdash; _you should openly and frequently communicate
your concerns_. What usually happens is that the outsourcing team stays
unaware of a real business situation and only hears "I need this ASAP" every
second day.

"ASAP" is not a deadline. Moreover, it's a very de-motivating subsitute
of a realistic milestone. When the team doesn't know when exactly you need
the product, what exactly has to be ready by that date, and _why_ &mdash;
they start to work against you. The emphasis here is on "why". For most
business owners it's difficult to answer this question.

Why do you
need the product to be ready by the 1st of June? Just because you are sick
of waiting? This is not a reasonable answer. You're sick but you still
have money in your bank account? They will keep invoicing you and they
won't respect you. They won't treat you as a strong and goal-oriented
business person. You either aren't smart enough to identify your
time constraints or you're hiding them from the team. In either case,
they won't appreciate that behavior.

Here is how a properly defined time and cost constraint may sound:

{% highlight text %}
Features A, B, and D must be ready before the 1st of June,
because marketing campaign starts on the 5th of June. If
we don't have them ready, I will loose $25,000 in marketing
costs. If this happens, I will have to cut monthly development
budget in half.
{% endhighlight %}

When the software outsourcing company, your partner, hears this definition
of a deadline, they become a real partner of yours. Now their goals
are aligned with yours. If the milestone is missed, you will suffer
and they understand exactly how. Besides that, they see how your
suffering will be transferred to their shoulders too.

Stop asking them to finish everything ASAP. Stop calling them twice a day
and yelling for an hour about their poor performance. Stop using language
in business emails. Stop making all this noise. It doesn't help you anyhow.
Moreover, it makes the situation only worse, because you're loosing respect
and they start treating you like a cash cow, a rather stupid and emotional one.

Instead, do your home work and define your realistic milestones. Think
about your real time, scope and budget limitations. Write them down in
very short and concise sentences. Make sure your constraints are realistic
and their descriptions answer the main question &mdash; why?

Why do you need this by the 1st of June? Why do you want to spend less than
$50,000? Why do you need all five features to be in version 1.0? Why
do you want your web app to be ready to handle 1K concurrent sessions?
Why do you need a mobile app in the first release?

Answer to yourself and make sure your answers are understood by the
outsourcing company. Don't hide this information.

## The product is so clumsy

You want your web app look like Pinterest, react fast, be easy to use,
and make you proud when you show it to your friends. But the product
they create for you is clumsy, slow, and, to be honest, urgly. You're
asking them to do something about it and they keep giving you promises.
The project keeps consuming your money, the budget grows, but the look-and-feel
is not getting any better. It is far from Pinterest, very far. The frustration
is growing and you don't see any reasonable way out of this. The only
advice you're getting from your friends is to re-do it all from scratch, with
a new web development team. How does this sound? I bet it's familiar.

I believe that the root cause of this dead-end situation is a fear
of conflict. At early stages of the project you are trying to do everything
to keep good relationship with the outsourcing company and don't offend them.
You don't want to control their work, because they may take it as an insult.
You don't want to express your quality concerns, because they may
de-motivate them. You just hope that they will improve the product in the future,
but when the future comes, it's too late.

Again, having the principle in mind, I would recommend, from the first
day of the project: establish a routine procedure of checking their
results and expressing your concerns. In our projects in
[Teamed.io](http://www.teamed.io) we ask our customers to be present
in Github, review our releases frequently and report any inconsistencies
found as Github issues. We encourage project sponsors to be as pessimistic
and negative about our quality from the beginning of the project. We realize
that this is how we can minimize the risk of a "piled up frustration".

Try to do the same in your project that you outsource to an offshore developer.
Don't be afraid to offend them. Iterative and incremental criticism is a much
healthier approach than feedback-free peace that ends with a war. Find a way
to keep your outsourcing team aware of your opinion about their results,
on a regular basis. Don't try to be nice to save a project. You're doing
yourself a bad favor. Instead, be open about your concerns. Remember
the first part of the principle above &mdash; you should openly and frequently
communicate your concerns. This is how you stabilize the project and minimize
risks.

Also, it is a very good practice, time to time, to invite
technical reviewers, to obtain independent opinions about the product
under development. Read my other post about this subject:
[You Do Need Independent Technical Reviews!]({% pst 2014/dec/2014-12-18-independent-technical-reviews %}).

## I can't rely on their promises

You call them, make plans, declare milestones, define features, set priorities,
agree about quality and then hang up. In a few days you realize that it was
a total waste of time. They don't keep the promises, because their is
always something new happening. Someone is sick, some server is broken,
some piece of software appears to be misfunctional, some code is no
longer working, etc. You call again, express your frustration, make
strong accusations, restructure milestones, re-define features, re-set
priorities and in a few days start over. Been there, done than? Sounds familiar?

In my experience, in most cases this un-predictability and un-reliability
of a software outsourcing team is caused by a project sponsor himself or herself.
This happens when you don't listen to them or they are afraid to tell
you the truth, which is usually the same thing. Some call this
"fear driven development". The team is afraid of you and, in order to
keep you on board as a paying customer, has to lie to you.

Basically, they are telling you what you want to hear &mdash;
that the end of the project is close, that currently open bugs are
easy to fix, that performance problems are minor, that the quality
of architecture is outstanding and the team is very motivated to work with you.
When you hear any of the above, question yourself &mdash; do you
encourage them to tell the truth? Do you reward them for bringing you
bad but honest news?

Having in mind the fundamental principle mentioned above, I would recommend:
make sure that your reasoning for awards and punishments is transparent for
your software outsourcing partner and is based on project objectives,
not your personal emotions.

In [one of my previous posts]({% pst 2015/jan/2015-01-26-happy-boss-false-objective %})
I said that a happy customer is a false objective for a software development team.
A customer that is promoting this objective is a terrible customer,
which is doomed to fail the project. If you reward your team when they
make you happy with good news, you are training them to lie to you. If you
expect them to deliver good news, you are discouraging them to tell
you the truth and to do what is good for the project, not for you personally.

You're discouraging them to argue with you. In other words, you're
throttling the channel of information that is supposed to come to you
from the people working for you. You're isolating yourself and the team
starts to work against you, not with you.

Here is a practical recommendation. First, regularly announce your reasonable
objectives and constraints, like I explained above. Make sure the team
understands your business plans and the "why?" reasoning behind them. Second,
regularly ask them about risks and issues. Ask them why they think project
objectives may be compromised. Even better, let them document risks
regularly and report them back to you. Reward them for being honest in
this list of risks.

Try it and you will be surprised how many interesting things that risk list
will contain.
