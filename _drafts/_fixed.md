I wrote about [micro tasking]({% pst 2017/nov/2017-11-28-microtasking %})
just recently. Now it's time to talk about
money. Micro money. Fixed micro money. As it was mentioned before,
micro tasking works only when each task has a very specific reward
for success and a punishment for failure.
I [believe]({% pst 2014/sep/2014-09-24-why-monetary-awards-dont-work %})
that the best rewarding and punishing instrument is money. The budget
is fixed, the programmer gets it only when the task is completed (reward), no matter
how much time it costed. If it is not completed, there is no money at all
(punishment). Pure and simple. However, the question arises: how can we
know upfront what is the right budget? Who sets it?
