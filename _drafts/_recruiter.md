  I've got a negative experience with a recruiting
  process of a big company and after that don't
  go to any interviews, unless they are on my terms.

It's a real story and it's not only about Google. I'm also getting emails
time to time from Amazon, Facebook, and smaller Silicon Valley startups. They
find me somehow, most probably through this blog or my GitHub account.
They always start with ``We're so impressed by your profile'' and finish with
``Let's schedule an interview.'' I always reply with the same text and they
always disappear, in order to come back in a few months, with a different name.
Let me explain my reasons, maybe you will do the same and we can change
the situation in the industry.

Disclaimer: I do realize that they are multi-billion dollar companies, the best
in the industry, and I'm nothing comparing to them.
I do realize that their recruiters don't care about my answers&mdash;they
simply delete them and move on. I also realize that they will never see
this text and most probably this article won't change anything. However,
I have to write it.

This is what I'm sending back to them:

> Thanks for your email. I'm very interested indeed. I have nothing against
an interview. However, on one condition: I have to be interviewed by the
person I will be working for, my future direct manager.

That recruiter who gets this text never gets back to me.

Why do I send this?

Well, because I learned my lesson two years ago,
when <del>can't disclose</del> tried to recruit me. I've got a similar email from them,
saying that they are so impressed by my profile and can't wait
to start working with me. They needed me, nobody else. I was naive, it did
flatter me.

We scheduled an interview, in their head office. They paid for my ticket to fly
there and a night in a 5-star hotel. I was impressed. They definitely were
interested. So was I.

What happened at the interview was, most probably very close to what
Max Howell [experienced](https://twitter.com/mxcl/status/608682016205344768)
with Google: some programmers, who didn't know a thing about my profile,
were asking me to invent some algorithms on a white board for almost
four hours. Did I manage? I don't think so. Did they hire me? No.

What did I learn? That it was a waste of time.

Their beuracratic machine is designed to process hundreds of candidates
a month. In order to fish and attract them there is an army of
<del>monkeys</del> recruiters, sending warm emails to people like me.
They have to screen candidates somehow and they are too lazy to make this
process effective and creative. They just send them through random
programmers, who are supposed to ask as complex questions as possible.

I'm not saying that people who pass their tests are not good programmers.
I'm also not saying that I'm a good programmers&mdash;let's face it,
I didn't pass the test. I do believe that this filtering system is rather good.
But it contradicts with the original email I got from the recruiter.

If she would start her email with ``We're looking for an algorithm
expert'' we would never get any further and would not waste our time.
Clearly, I'm not an expert in algorithms. There is no point in giving
me binary tree traversing questions, I don't know that answers
and will never be interested in learning them. I'm trying to be an expert
in something else, like object-oriented design, for example.

There was a clear mismatch between my profile and the expectations of
their interviewers. I don't blame them, I don't blame the recruiters. They
all are just <del>slaves</del> employees. I blame myself for not setting
this all straight at the very beginning.

I should have told her that I don't want to be interviewed by _some_
programmers, because I will fail. No need to try. I want to be interviewed
by the person who really needs me: my future boss. That person will
understand my profile and won't ask about algorithms. Simply because
he or she will know what will my duties be and what kind of problems
I will solve, if they hire me.

Unfortunately, as I keep observing over the last two years of bouncing
that emails back to recruiters, they can't change anything. They have
to do formal and standard screening for everybody, at the same time
keeping sending warm and flattering initial promises.

I'm sorry, recruiters, no more interviews with me.
