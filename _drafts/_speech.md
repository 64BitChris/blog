I speak at software conferences regularly. Over the last three years, I
spoke in 30 cities and 10 countries. I recorded <del>almost</del> all of them, you can
see them [here](/talks.html) and in my
[YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/yegor256?sub_confirmation=1).
My principal rule is that I never give the same speech more
than once. Every time it's a new deck of slides and a new flow of thoughts.
Of course, they all dance around the ideas I preach for, like
[Elegant Objects](/elegant-objects.html) or rebelion against office slavery.
I guess it's time to share some of my secrets, mostly learned the hard way.

**Demand a Larger Room**.
You know what's funny is that the smaller the room, the more difficult is
the talk. The easiest talks I've had were done in front of 400+ people. The
most difficult ones had like ten people. That's why I'm trying to insist, when
I can, that my talk should be in the main room with more seats. How so? Read on.

**Take a Morning Slot**.
I'm not sure there is a rule for that, but my experience tells me that
the best speakers usually open an event and quit before lunch. If your slot
is somewhere closer to the end, make up any fake reason, like a flight,
and ask organizers to move you to earlier time. The best slot is right
after the first one, when everybody is already awake but not too hungry and
still on premise.

**Bring Friends**.
It's way easier for me when there are some people in the room who I know and who
will support me no matter how bad is my talk. It's even easier when they
are being loud. The key trait of a good speaker is knowing how to break
the wall between the stage and the room. The presence of friends helps.
Sometimes I don't have any friends over there, when the place is new and I
just arrived. I'm trying to make a few, right before the talk, while checking-in
and walking around. Then I'm inviting them to my talk. Most of them don't really
care where to go and easily agree. For them, having a friend at the stage,
is an honor. So, it's win-win.

**10/20/30 Rule**.
Ever heard about [this rule](https://guykawasaki.com/the_102030_rule/) of Guy Kawasaki?
The gist is that your presentation may not include more than ten slides,
last for longer than twenty minutes, and thirty points is the smallest font
you can use. Don't take it literally, but it does make a lot of sense.

**Bring No Slides**.
The best presenter uses no slides at all. The worst one will have 200+ of them
for a 30 minutes talk. Where are you in this interval? You have to tell a story,
or three ones, like [Steve Jobs did](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1R-jKKp3NA).
Imagine yourself talking to me
over a cafe table. Would you show me slides? I doubt it. You will just speak and worry about
me understanding you. Do the same on the stage. Of course, you may have some visual data,
just like you would use a napkin at the cafe. But that's all. Your slides have
to support your talk, instead of being its replacement. I strongly recommend
you to read these two great books:
[_slide:ology: The Art and Science of Presentation Design_](https://amzn.to/2zw09nx) by Nancy Duarte
and
[_Presentation Zen: Simple Ideas on Presentation Design and Delivery_](https://amzn.to/2PeHth9) by Garr Reynolds.

**Stay Cool ... Not**.
Be brave. Stay strong. Look them in the eye. Smile. Relax. Everything will be fine! ...
Don't listen to this nonsense. It doesn't work this way. I always feel scared. And I
always ask myself right before the talk---maybe let's hide somewhere in the
bathroom, they won't find me and will quietly cancel the talk. You have to
feel something similar. If you don't, there is something wrong with you.
What to do with the fear? Embrace it. Just like you do it when watching a horror movie.
Enjoy seeing yourself wetting pants. Look at yourself from an outside. I often
say to myself: "Let's see how you can survive the next 45 minutes, dude."

**Make Friends**.
My experience tells me that only about one out of 20 people in the room are really
listening to what I'm saying and are capable of understanding. The rest of them
is just a crowd. So, when there are 200 people in the room, only ten of them
are my real audience. It's important to find them as soon as possible and keep
talking to them, looking them right in the eye. Ignore everybody else.
Oh, and by the way, if you have to speak in front of 10 people, you are screwed.
Because, according to the "1 out of 20" formula, most likely there will be nobody interested
in what you are saying.

**Make Enemies**.
The most interesting discussion is a scandal. Well, the most entertaining one.
To have a scandal you need a conflict, between you and your audience. Well, not
the entire room, but a smaller part of it. You are not that strong, I suppose,
as of yet, to have the entire room against you. Although, that would be the
best speaking experience in your life. However, just a few enemies will show up if you
say something that contradicts the _status quo_. Once you say it (and you should),
someone will disagree and shout out. Don't try to calm them down. Instead,
be agressive with something like "Thanks to people like you we still have Windows."
Success guaranteed.

**Structure It**.
You know, I almost never attend other people's talks. You know why? I very
quickly loose the train of thought and then just wait until the speaker finishes. I can
listen for the first five minutes, then something distracts me for a minute,
and I can never get back. The problem, I believe, is that speakers don't announce
the structure of their presentations and don't stay strictly attached to it
during the course of it. Here is what I'd suggest to do instead. When you start,
say to your listeners what is the key idea you are going to deliver. Then, explain how you
are going to structure the next 45 minutes: What will go first, what next, how
you will end. Then, while you go, remind them about the structure, time to time, like:
"Hey, we are at the third principle, while there are seven of them, stay
with me for another 15 minutes and we will be done."

**Intrigue**.
I'm not a master of it, but the principle is simple: don't give away everything,
promise to give it out later instead. Something like: "This doesn't work, and I will
tell you later why, in a few minutes." They will stay interested to know that
and you will be able to feed them with something else. Also, if someone asks
a question in the middle of the talk, you may start answering it, then stop
and say: "I will touch this problem in a few minutes." You got the idea: keep
them interested by not telling everything right away.

**Ask Questions**.
My rule of thumb is that at least once per five minutes I have to ask my audience
a question. The easiest one is "Does it make sense so far?" or "Do you follow?"
A few examples of more complex ones:
"Have you ever heard about ...?"
"Who of you knows how this works?"
"Does it look familiar to what you experience in your projects?"
and so on.
What do you need to do that for? To know their opinion? Not at all. You don't
care about their opinion. You just need to relax yourself. That's why your
questions should be as neutral as possible, expecting no specific or difficult
to deal with answers. It's just an instrument to release the speaker and return
the attention pressure back to the room, for a few seconds.

**Don't Rehearse**.
Well, maybe just once. Don't try to make your talk perfect. Nobody needs that. You are
not a clown, not a professional actor, not a speaker on a payroll. You are a
software engineer with a unique opinion. We need your thoughts straight from
your heart and your real experience. Don't worry about being a bad speaker,
this doesn't matter much. Worry about the _consistency_ of your arguments. Don't try
to remember the exact words you will be saying or the jokes you will be making---this
will only make you look fishy. Just make sure your arguments are strong
and deliver them just like you would do if you were convincing a friend
standing next to the coffee machine.

**Don't Be Funny**.
Don't make funny slides and don't prepare jokes.
Those are cheap techniques. Don't sell yourself that short. Stay serious about your content.
If there will be a moment for a joke, make it, if you feel like it.
Otherwise, don't be like one of those [keynote clowns]({% pst 2016/may/2016-05-10-keynote-clowns %}).
You are not a showman out there to entertain them with a red nose. You are supposed
to entertain with your provocative ideas and unique thoughts.

**Have Fun**.
You have to enjoy it. I know it's stressful, but you have to find a way to
relax and fool around a little bit. Sometimes I catch a sight of a smiling cute lady
in the eigth row and smile back. Sometimes the clicker doesn't work and I switch
slides [by my feet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rip_04Bv3Jk). Sometimes
I just fool around

**Be Humble**.
I believe that a really good speaker knows where to say "I don't know" (not too often though).
If you know everything, you can't be trusted. You have to demonstrate them
that you are one of them, but a bit more advanced in one area. You are a programmer,
just like them, but you know a bit more about Java memory management. And you are
still learning and there is still a lot to learn. Now it's time to share your
learning experience with them. To share. Pay attention to this word. Not to
teach them, but to share what you know. When you say "I don't know this" we
trust you more, because we understand that you accurately estimate the limits
of your knowledge.

**Don't Be Shy**.
I totally forgot to touch this key question: Why are you making the speech? There
can be many answers, but the best one and the most honest is: It is for self-promotion.
Use your first and last few minutes to tell them who you are and, this is more
important, what do you want them to do. I wasn't doing that for many years,
I thought that a good speaker must be humble and stay focused on the content
instead of themselves. I was very wrong. Now I give them explicit instructions
of what I want from them: follow my Twitter, subscribe to my Telegram channel,
sign up to Zerocracy, etc.

**Provoke Questions**.
You know how I know whether my talk was a success or a failure? I tell by
the amount of questions I hear. The more, the better. I'm lucky so far---even
my worst talks had a few questions in the end. My best ones though were
filled with them, starting from the 10th minute. That's what success is for me!
How can you do the same? Be provocative in your content and exaggerate.
Also, ask yourself before the talk, where are the points of concern and leave
many of them unexplained. Questions will show up.

You know, while I was working with this blog post, I did some research online
and found out that there are tons of books and articles about this subject. There
are hundreds of recommendations and my short list above is merely a few percent
of what people say about this and I can actually say too.

Thus, I belive I will publish a book about it,
similar to the [_256 Bloghacks_](/256-bloghacks.html) I wrote a few years go.
Maybe I will title it _256 Speechhacks_.

Stay tuned!
