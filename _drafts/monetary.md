Monetary rewards for employees. Do they work? Should we use them?
Can money motivate creative minds? Will a programmer work
better if he gets paid only when he reaches his goals and objectives?

Multiple researches have already been done on this subject
and most of them proved that connecting results with money
is a very demotivating approach. For example, Ian Larkin
[says](http://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/7215.html) that the most productive workers
"suffered a 6-8% decrease in productivity after the award was instituted".

I believe, this is all true. Money may become a terrible de-motivator
for modern employees (not only programmers).

My question is &mdash; why is it so?

<!--more-->

Why money don't work, while they were invented as
a universal instrument to measure our labor? Why an american dollar,
which was used for centuries as a trading tool between working
people, can't be used any more?

Why, in a modern office, we're trying to hide
monetary motivation and replace it with
[anything else](http://www.hrworld.com/features/25-employee-rewards/),
like free lunches, team building events,
paid vacations, etc. Why don't we want to eventually say
loud in the office &mdash; "Jeff completed his task faster then
everybody else, this is his $500 check. Who will complete the
next one, gets $300"... Sounds unconfortable, isn't it?

Why money, as a motivator, scares us?

I have an answer.

Money don't work when there are no ground rules.

When we say that Jeff will get a $500 bonus if he finishes his task on time, but
don't say what should he do when someone distracts him &mdash; Jeff
gets frustrated. He doesn't understand who is his boss any more. Does
he work for the bonus or he should also satisfy a CTO coming to his
desk asking to do something urgently. Is it allowed to tell her "to get lost
because I'm working towards my personal objectives (the bonus)"?

In all cases I've seen myself and in all research cases I've read about,
people keep repeating the same mistake. They create a rewarding program
(monetary or not) without setting ground rules in the team. By doing so,
they encourage people to play wild west, where the fastest gets the
cash bag. Obviously, the bad and the ugly get to the prize faster.
The good gets demotivated and depressed.

What do I mean by ground rules? It should be a simple document
([PMBOK](http://www.pmi.org/PMBOK-Guide-and-Standards.aspx)
calls it Staffing Management Plan) that helps me, as a team member,
answer at least these basic questions:

 * How my personal results are measured?

 * Who gives me tasks and who I report to?

 * How should I resolve conflicts between tasks?

 * What are my personal deadlines for every task?

 * Do I have measurable quality expectations for my deliverables?

 * How my mistakes affect my performance grade?

The ground rules document should be superior than your boss. If the document
says that your results gets an A+ grade, the boss has no say. If she
does't like you personally, it doesn't matter. You get an A+ grade and you
are the best. That's it.

Does your team have such a document? Can you answer all of these questions?
If not, you're not ready for a rewarding program. It will only
make your management situation worse, like all that
scientific researches say. Rewards will motivate
the most cunning to take advantage of the most hard
working and good-natured. Team spirit will suffer, big time.

On the other hand, if you have that "ground rules" document and you
strictly follow it, giving monetary rewards to your workers will
significantly increase their performance and motivation. Because they will
know exactly what needs to be done to get the rewards and won't have
any distraction. Your team won't be a wild west any more but a
sport arena. The best players will get further and the worst will
know exactly what needs to be done to improve. Fair competition
will lead to a better cumulative result.

Moreover, if your ground rules are strict and explicit, you can
use not only rewards, but also punishments. Your team will accept
them gladly, because they will have to all of you to emphasizes
those who works best of all and get rid of the waste.

My experience is speaking here. In [XDSD](http://www.xdsd.org)
we're not only rewarding programmers with money, but we never pay
for anything except delivered results. We manage to do this mostly because
our groud rules are very strict and non-ambiguous. And we never
break them.
