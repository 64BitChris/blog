Monetary rewards for employees. Do they work? Should we use them?
Can money motivate creative minds? Will a programmer work
better if he gets paid for deliverables instead of time spent?

Multiple researches have already been done on this subject
and most of them proved that connecting results with money
is a very demotivating approach.

This is all true, I totally agree with these analysts. Money is
a terrible motivator for modern employees (not only programmers).

However, they miss the main point &mdash; why is it so?
Why money don't work, while there were invented as
a universal instrument to measure our labor? Why an american dollar
that was used for centuries as a trading tool between working
people doesn't work any more?

Why, in a modern office, we're trying to hide
monetary motivation and replace it with
[anything else](http://www.hrworld.com/features/25-employee-rewards/),
like free lunches, coffee machines, team building events,
paid vacations, etc. Why we don't want to eventually say
it loud in the office &mdash; "Jeff completed his task faster then
everybody else, this is his $500 check. Who will complete the
next one, gets $300"... Well, I've never heard anything like that.
