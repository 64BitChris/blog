Let me give a practical example. This July, just four month ago,
I submitted an article to [InfoQ](http://www.infoq.com/), a rather
popular online tech magazine. In the article I
suggested that in order to improve our projects we must not make programmers worry
about the quality of code they write, but instead let them mostly focus
on the speed of delivery. The quality, I argued in the
article, must be the concern of the delivery pipeline. You most probably
read my blog posts, where I mentioned that, especially this one:
[Don't Aim for Quality, Aim for Speed]({% pst 2018/mar/2018-03-06-speed-vs-quality %}).

I received a response from InfoQ editor over the email, I quote:
"The article provides no new insights for our audience, and actually some recommendations
that go against well-known good practices in DevOps."
I [twitted](https://twitter.com/yegor256/status/1015261994826567680)
about that and Churles Humble, their editor-in-chief, emailed me back.
He said that he still didn't want to publish my piece, because
"both people who reviewed it are experienced DevOps practitioners,
and felt strongly that, although the ideas presented were interesting,
it wasnâ€™t something that would generalize well or work well for more mature teams."

Two people decided that my point of view was wrong and that's why the entire
audience must not hear it. They know better what "works well for more mature teams."
Pay attention, they didn't say anything about
the quality of my article, about the way I structured my arguments, about the
consistency of the logic in it. They totally got what I wanted to say, but they
disagreed. My opinion didn't go along with theirs. That's why---no stage for the guy.

You want to know what happened next?
I submitted that article to the blog section of the Communications of the ACM
and it was [published](https://cacm.acm.org/blogs/blog-cacm/229942-blame-free-quality-control/fulltext) there.
I also submitted it to a number of software conferences, where it was accepted,
including [Joker](https://youtu.be/55mwAbuDrV8) in St. Petersburg, Russia.

Here comes my point. We may disagree with others. It happens. Their ideas
