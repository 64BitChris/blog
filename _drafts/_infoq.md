  If you want to get your text published, you should write
  something everybody would agree with ... or maybe not;
  here is my story of success.

This July, just four months ago,
I submitted an article to [InfoQ](http://www.infoq.com/), a rather
popular online tech magazine. In the article I
suggested that in order to improve our projects we must not make programmers worry
about the quality of code they write, but instead let them mostly focus
on the speed of delivery. The quality, I argued in the
article, must be the concern of the delivery pipeline. You most probably
read my blog posts, where I mentioned that, especially this one:
[Don't Aim for Quality, Aim for Speed]({% pst 2018/mar/2018-03-06-speed-vs-quality %}).

I received a response from InfoQ editor over the email, and I quote:
"The article provides no new insights for our audience, and actually some recommendations
that go against well-known good practices in DevOps."
I [twitted](https://twitter.com/yegor256/status/1015261994826567680)
about that and Churles Humble, their editor-in-chief, emailed me back.
He said that he still didn't want to publish my piece, because
"both people who reviewed it are experienced DevOps practitioners,
and felt strongly that, although the ideas presented were interesting,
it wasn't something that would generalize well or work well for more mature teams."

Two people decided that my point of view was wrong and that's why the entire
audience must not hear it! They know better what "works well for more mature teams."
Pay attention, they didn't say anything about
the quality of my article, about the way I structured my arguments, about the
consistency of the logic in it. They totally got what I wanted to say, but they
disagreed. My opinion didn't go along with theirs. That's why---no stage for the guy.

You know what happened next? I sent my piece, without any changes, to Gerard Holzmann,
one of the editors of [IEEE Software](https://publications.computer.org/software-magazine/).
You know what he said? I quote:
"I like your analogy of a wall, but when I reflect on it I believe it is
really no more than the standard check-in and commit process that most
organizations use. So I'm sorry that we can't use it."
See? InfoQ guys thought that it's the practice that nobody would use, while
IEEE Software editor thinks that it's something everybody is using already.

Ironically, huh?

Finally, I submitted that very same article to the blog section of the Communications of the ACM
and it was [published](https://cacm.acm.org/blogs/blog-cacm/229942-blame-free-quality-control/fulltext) there,
maybe thanks to the objectivism of Lawrence Fisher, their editor.
I also submitted it to a number of software conferences, where it was accepted,
including [Joker 2018](https://youtu.be/55mwAbuDrV8) in St. Petersburg, Russia.

Here comes my point.

Tech journalism sucks.

If you want to be published, say what everybody else is saying. Or say something
very new. I don't really know. What I do from now on? I keep sending my
pieces to many places. I even created a list of journalists (over 200 magazines)
and <del>spam</del> send them my articles via [Mailanes]({% pst 2018/oct/2018-10-30-mailanes %}).

It seems they don't deserve a better attitude.

Sadly.
