A bug is something we find in a software product that doesn't look right (this
is my personal definition). A bug can be hidden or visible. A bug can be
"already fixed" or "still present." A bug can be critical or cosmetic. It
can be urgent or of a low priority. What is important is that the more
bugs we are able to find and fix before our customers, the higher
is the perceived quality of the software. Simply put, bugs are a very
good thing, if they are found by us, not our customers.
