Here is how it works, again and again. I find a new developer for one of
my projects managed by Zerocracy. He claims to be an expert with 10 years
of hands-on coding experience, $60 hourly rate (we don't hire US guys),
and a fluent English. Then, he joins the project and attempts
to close a few tickets. He hardly can. For many reasons. Then, he comes back
and explain why [our microtasking methodology]({% pst 2017/nov/2017-11-28-microtasking %})
doesn't work, trying to convince me
that I have to pay him [per hour]({% pst 2015/jul/2015-07-21-hourly-pay-modern-slavery %}),
instead of per result. Here is my answer.

No matter how bad is the methodology, you do know that [we pay]({% pst 2014/apr/2014-04-13-bugs-are-welcome %})
per each bug, which is found and properly reported, right?
Check [ยง29](http://www.zerocracy.com/policy.html#29) of our Policy.

If the Code Base Is Bad, Why Don't You Report Bugs?

If the Code Base Is Good, Where Are Your Pull Requests?

There is only one metric in our projects, which separate good programmers
from bad ones: the amount of money they are making.
You can make them by contributing to the project either via
1) reporting bugs (when you see problems)
or 2) submitting pull requests (when you don't see problems).

If none of that work for you, you are a bad programmer.

Good bye.
