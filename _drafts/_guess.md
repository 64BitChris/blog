  I call it verbal terrorism where I'm being asked
  questions I can't understand, because they are totally
  out of context or there is simply no context.

It's Sunday. I'm at home, drinking tea and writing a new document for
one of our future investors. One of my contacts in Telegram all of a sudden shoots me
a message. I haven't talked to this guy for at least two months. He is
a software developer. I know him because he works in Zerocracy. His name
is Paul.

{% jb_picture_body %}

Paul: "Hey, it's broken!"

Me: "What exactly?"

Paul: "The link."

Me: "What link?"

Paul sends me the link.

Me: "Where did you get it?"

Paul: "In your blog."

Me: "Where exactly in the blog?"

Paul gives me the link to the blog post where one of the links are broken.

Me: "Thanks for noticing!"

Paul: "Sure, have a good Sunday, sorry for bothering you."

Me: "No worries."

I'm asking myself, why Paul didn't just send me a single message, which would
sound like this: "Hey, the link ... in your blog post ... is broken."

Moreover, why Paul didn't just go to the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/yegor256/blog)
and didn't submit a ticket?

Even more, why Paul didn't just fix the broken link and didn't submit a pull
request?

Do you know the answer?

I have three hypothesises.

The first one is that Paul is a lonely guy. He has nothing to do on Sunday and wants to
talk to someone. A broken link in my blog is a perfect motive to start
a conversation.

The second one is that Paul was testing my reactions, like those
funny radio shows are doing by calling strangers, trying
to be super annoying to trigger their angry reaction.

The third one, and this is my favorite, is that Paul simply doesn't know how
to deliver information _together_ with its context. And this is where we
get serious.

This is the mistake so many programmers are making, in my experience
in dealing with them. When they deliver the question they have, they think
that me, their listener, is right inside the same context as they are at the very same
moment. They think that I'm sitting right now reading exactly the same
blog post trying to open the same broken link. That's why it's a good
moment to just ask me: "Hey, it's broken!"

Is it a [mental disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schizophasia)
or just negligence and lack of respect to the listener?

Honestly, I think it's a bit of both.

I [wrote]({% pst 2015/jun/2015-06-29-simple-diagrams %}) some time ago
that _if I don't understand you, it's your fault_. However, sometimes
this "verbal terrorism" (isn't it?) has to be punished.
Here is my short list of counter measures:

  * **Silence**.
    Instead of trying to clarify the message I just don't answer.
    Sometimes it works, but very often it doesn't, since I realize that
    the information that is coming to me is valuable. Just like in this
    situation with Paul. I was interested to know what exactly is broken,
    either it's a link or maybe some of my pet webservices is down. Thus,
    silence wasn't not an option.

  * **Being Silly**.
    Instead of clarifing I'm sometimes trying to make the situation even worse,
    pretending that I understand the message and the context is clear for me,
    but it's a different context. For example, right after "The link is broken"
    I would answer "No, it's not, I just checked!" That would confuse Paul,
    since he would need to put some extra effort to explain me what link was
    that why it is indeed broken.

  * **Long Pauses**.
    Instead of a complete silence I sometimes take very long pauses between
    their questions and my answers. Some of them realize that the questions
    are out of context and attempt to provide additional details. Others just
    wait, which very often helps me switch them to the silence treatment.

Was this blog post offensive or I said what many of you also experience
when dealing with tech people? Or it's not only tech people specific? I'm not
sure, but most of those verbal terrorists I meet among programmers.

Please, guys, try to be more respectful and careful in your conversations,
especially digital ones. Your listener is not your only friend, thinking
and doing exactly what you are thinking and doing now. Always imagine that
the context of the listener is absolutely different from yours and just
saying that "it" is broken is not enough. You do have to specify what
you are going to talk about before jumping to the point.

This is definitely one of that [soft skills]({% pst 2018/aug/2018-08-29-soft-skills %})
I mentioned before.

Thanks.
