I've had a [presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biE86esgFAE)
a few days ago, which triggered a discussion
afterwards with a few conference attendees. They were agruing that
team responsibility is what proper management is about, not an individual one,
like I was claiming during my speech.
In a few minutes we found out that our _definitions_ of responsibility
were quite different. Because of that, I believe, the discussion got stuck.
I'm still puzzled. Indeed, what does _responsibility_ mean, for a
member of a software team?
