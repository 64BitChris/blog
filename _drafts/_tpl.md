"Listen up, dude," a friend of mine called me yesterday, "I trusted them
for over a year, we've been partners, they've been programming it all
and I was busy doing business development. Now they want to quit and
I'm left with nothing. What am I supposed to do with all these
JavaScript files? How do I even know they are mine? Moreover, they don't even
want to cooperate. I fee like a hostage, please, help me out!"
What could I say? "It's too late, dude," was my answer, "but the
good news are&mdash;you are not alone."

"Trust, pay, lose" is how I would call this typical scenario.

First, you **trust** your programmers. You call them partners.
You believe in them. You are sure that you picked the best ones. They seem
to be very reliable. You look at their resumes and feel excited. They
know JavaScript, and DevOps, and GitHub, and even Big Data. They definitely
are the best. Moreover, they are in business for ten years. What else
do you need, right?

Second, you **pay** them. How else they would work, right? True talent
is expensive, we all [know that]({% pst 2014/oct/2014-10-29-how-much-do-you-cost %}).
They bill you [regularly]({% pst 2014/oct/2014-10-21-incremental-billing %})
for [the time]({% pst 2015/jul/2015-07-21-hourly-pay-modern-slavery %}) they
spend working with your project. You feel excited to see how your money
turns into software that works. They deploy new versions regularly. They
demonstrate the product. Of course, there are bugs, but this is how it
[should be]({% pst 2015/jun/2015-06-18-good-programmers-bug-free %}),
right? They explain you everything and you keep paying.

Finally, you **lose** when you realize that it's their software, not yours.
They quit because of some business reasons and you stay with nothing.
You can't even understand that files. You don't even have them, since they
are somewhere in their Git repository. You hire somebody else
to help you save what's left, but they say that it's time to start
developing from scratch. You are a hostage.

What is the alternative, you ask?

Don't trust.

Instead, before you start a project, hire an
[independent expert]({% pst 2014/dec/2014-12-18-independent-technical-reviews %}),
who will regularly (ideally, bi-weekly) review everything
these guys are doing and tell you where and how you may lose.
This expert will update a Risk List for you. You will take necessary
preemptive actions.

Don't trust us programmers, we are smart and we are lazy. You will lose.
