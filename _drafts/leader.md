A properly organized and managed project doesn't need a leader &mdash; it needs
a manager. What is the difference? A huge one. A leader drives
people forward using personal charisma. To the contrary,
a project manager clears the road letting them drive by
themselves. The difference is serious: driving vs clearing the road.
Leadership **enslaves** them, while project management treats them
as **free and independent** self-motivated individuals.

As it [was discussed]({% pst 2016/feb/2016-02-18-holacracy-autocracy %}) already,
a project can be seen as a transaction between its team and its sponsor. We, the team,
give the sponsor our time, skills, ideas, etc. The sponsor
gives us money, new knowledge, satisfaction, etc. It's a trade.

What do we need in order to make this transaction fair and effective for both sides? We
need it to be clearly defined. That definition must include plans, schedules,
payment agenda, motivational schema, and everything else that helps us work
towards **our** goals. And our goals are our money, our new knowledge, our
satisfaction, etc.

We need a good organizer of all that. We need a project manager, who is
capable of making our work structured and logical. We actually don't even
need a manager. We don't want to see that person at all or know who that is.
All we need is a structure that will help us achieve our goals.

All that is true if we're free, independent, self-motivate and self-sufficient
professionals, who know exactly what they want and are strong enough to
focus on their goals and achieve them.

On the other hand, if we're
[office slaves]({% pst 2015/oct/2015-10-06-how-to-be-good-office-slave %}),
we will need something completely different. We will need a leader, who
will hyptonize us with his or her charisma and take put responsibility of
the entire result on his or her shoulders.

Instead of a project plan we'll have morning standups with motivational
music. Instead of a strict payment agenda we'll have team building parties.
Instead of

Of course, it's much easier to be a leader than a manager.
