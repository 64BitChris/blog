I'm frequently being asked by programmers who are planning to join
[Zerocracy]({% pst 2018/mar/2018-03-21-zerocracy-announcement %})
or have joined already and now trying to figure out how much money they can make in the platform:
Is it possible to work here full-time? Here is my answer: Why do want
to work full-time? Of course, I know why, but I would suggest
you to ask a different question instead: Is it possible to make
$100 an hour here? Unfortunately, I hear that question much less frequently.

We used to think that our income depends on the amount of time we spend
for a project. If we sit there for 8-10 hours a day, we get a full
monthly salary, which will most likely cover all our expenses. This
is what the industry calls _full-time_ engagement.

If we work in a few projects, spending a few hours a day here and there,
we have to put their payckecks together making sure they cover our
expenses. This is called _part-time_ and it's risky, since we have
to always be on alert---whether there are enough projects in the pipeline,
whether they pay enough, and where do we find new projects when these
ones finish.

Full-time employment is way more secure. However, it has a number of drawbacks.
