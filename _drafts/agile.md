[Agile Manifesto](http://www.agilemanifesto.org/) is nowadays a Bible of
so many software teams. It contains
[12 principles](http://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html), which are
supposed to show us how software development must be organized.
They were invented in 2001.
I like them and agree with all of them. However, in practice, most software teams
misunderstand them all. Here is my summary of what's going on and my
own interpretation of each principle.

<!--more-->

**Principle #1**:
"Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software."

Staying focused on "satisfy the customer" Agile adepts totally forget about
the "through" part. They think that a [happy customer]({% pst 2015/jan/2015-01-26-happy-boss-false-objective %})
is their true objective, while "continuous delivery" is something that obviously
helps, while is not really critical. It is quite the opposite &mdash; the customer
will be satisfied **if** the software is created and delivered right. If the
customer is not satisfied, we find another customer &mdash; that's the
true spirit a professional software team should adhere to. That's what
the Manifesto means, I believe. We make sure that our process is
"early and continuous" and the customer will be satisfied. We focus on improving
our process, not on satisfying the customer. Satisfaction is the consequence, not
the primary objective.

{% quote If the customer is not satisfied, we find another customer %}

**Principle #2**:
"Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage."

Most Agile teams understand "welcome" word here as a permission to forget
about any [requirements]({% pst 2015/nov/2015-11-10-ten-mistakes-in-specs %})
management at all. What is the easiest way to welcome
changes? Obviously, just get rid of any requirements documents at all!
In that case any changes will be welcome, since they won't affect anything.
There simply won't be anything to affect. But this is not what the Manifesto
means! This principle means that our requirements management process is so
**powerful** that it can accept changes at any moment. It's rather difficult to
achieve, if requirements are actually documented.

**Principle #3**:
"Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale."

This terrific rule is usually understood as an order for the entire team. The
team has to deliver frequently, while programmers are free to delivery almost
nothing and who knows when. I think that the Manifesto here is talking about
both individual and group responsibility to deliver frequently. And, I also think
that the frequency must be way higher than "couple of weeks". Today, with
modern technologies and instruments, we can deliver way faster &mdash; multiple
times per day.

**Principle #4**:
"Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project."

Working together doesn't mean working without clearly defined
rules and processes. However, most teams understand this principle as
a legalization of chaos. Since we work together, we don't need to define roles
any more, we should not document [requirements]({% pst 2015/nov/2015-11-10-ten-mistakes-in-specs %}),
we shouldn't care about responsibilities. In the end, we don't know who is
doing what and what is the structure of our team. That's not what the Manifesto
is talking about! "Working together" means faster turnaround in communications and
shorter response cycle. But it doesn't mean lack of roles and responsibilities.

**Principle #5**:
"Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done."

Trust is a great word and concept, but it doesn't replace another great
word and concept &mdash; control. Most Agile teams think that trust means
exactly that &mdash; complete lack of any validation, verification, responsibility,
and control. "We trust our programmers and they write perfect code" &mdash;
I've heard so many times. That's simply wrong. This principle means something else.
It means that when clearly defined tasks are clearly assigned to their
performers we fully delegate responsibilities to them. We
[motivate]({% pst 2014/sep/2014-09-24-why-monetary-awards-dont-work %})
them to be fully responsible for the end result. And we
[don't help]({% pst 2015/feb/2015-02-16-it-is-not-a-school %}) them.
Instead, we trust them as self-sufficient individuals, capable
of completing their tasks on their own.

**Principle #6**:
"The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation."

Face-to-face doesn't mean sitting in the same office. The Manifesto didn't say
anything about co-located or distributed teams. It's obvious that in modern software projects
virtual communications (over video calls) are way more effective than
staying together in the same country, samey city, same office, and same room.
However, most Agile adepts still promote on-site development style, using
Agile Manifesto as a proof. That's a mistake. Now face-to-face means something
very different from what it meant 15 years ago, when the Manifesto was written.

**Principle #7**:
"Working software is the primary measure of progress."

This doesn't mean that we should not measure anything else. Of course, the
working software is the **primary** measure, but there are many other
measures, which we can and must use. For example, the amount of features
documented, implemented and delivered;
or the amount of lines of code added to the project (don't smile, [read]({% pst 2014/nov/2014-11-14-hits-of-code %}));
or the amount of [bugs found]({% pst 2015/sep/2015-09-10-testing-exit-criteria %});
or the amounts of [dollars spent]({% pst 2016/jan/2016-01-19-how-expensive-is-outsourcing %}).
There are many other metrics. We can use many of them. However, a typical
mistake many Agile teams are doing is just ignoring them all. They say
"we measure only the end result". That's not what the Manifesto
is suggesting to do though.

**Principle #8**:
"Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely."

This doesn't mean that we should [burn]({% pst 2015/jun/2015-06-02-how-to-estimate-software-cost %})
customer's money indefinitely. Yes, we
should be developing at some given speed, but we must always remember about
the money we're spending &mdash; customer's money. Manifesto doesn't say anything
about the cost of development and that's probably because it was written by
those who make money (programmers) not those who spend them (customers). We must
remember that any project is first of all a money burning machine. That's why
the team must always measure its
[burn rate]({% pst 2016/jan/2016-01-19-how-expensive-is-outsourcing %})
and make sure it is aligned with
the amount of business value the team delivers. Just being a
[happy team]({% pst 2015/mar/2015-03-02-team-morale-myths-and-reality %})
is not what the Manifesto is suggesting, but many understand this principle
exactly like that.

**Principle #9**:
"Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility."

That's a perfect principle that says so much and doesn't say anything at
the same time. What exactly is "attention"? I can explain. It means
[rules and policies]({% pst 2015/oct/2015-10-13-competition-without-rules %}).
And any policy first of all means [punishment]({% pst 2016/jan/2016-01-05-how-to-punish-employees %}) to those
who violate the rules. Thus, if an Agile team really means continuous
attention to technical excellence it must have a [quality policy]({% pst 2014/aug/2014-08-13-strict-code-quality-control %}).
That policy must clearly define which design is good and which is bad, which piece
of Java code is excellent, which is ugly, etc. And the policy must say
what happens to those who [violates]({% pst 2015/nov/2015-11-24-imprisonment-for-irresponsible-coding %})
the principles of excellence. Most Agile
teams, however, understand "quality" as a great flag to hang on the wall, but
get very scared when I start asking "what happens if someone delivers low quality".

**Principle #10**:
"Simplicity &mdash; the art of maximizing the amount of work not done &mdash; is essential."

That's a great rule which most Agile teams don't follow at all. This principle
means that our tasks are small and simple enough to make sure they are either
doable or cancellable. Big tasks are the biggest threat to manageability of
any team, be it Agile or not. This principle encourages us to give programmers
small tasks, which they can easily complete. However, most of Agile adepts
simplicity being equal to stupidity. They are not equal. A simple task doesn't
mean a stupid or non-important tasks. A simple task is a clearly defined, small,
and doable work order.

**Principle #11**:
"The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams."

Self-organized doesn't mean un-organized. This rule very often is translated
as a legalization of **anarchy**. We don't need any project managers, we don't need
processes, discipline, rules, or policies &mdash; we've got
[holacracy]({% pst 2016/feb/2016-02-18-holacracy-autocracy %}) instead!
We don't even need a software architect &mdash; our programmers can make
all technical decisions at regular [meetings]({% pst 2015/jul/2015-07-13-meetings-are-legalized-robbery %})!
And we don't want our programmers
to be individually responsible for anything &mdash; they are always together
in all risks and issues. Stop that nonsense! This is not what the Manifesto means.
A self-organizing team is a team that doesn't need any supervision from the outside,
a team that has clearly defined roles inside,
a team with a perfect inner discipline,
a team with professional [management]({% pst 2016/may/2016-05-24-who-is-project-manager %}).
Not with the lack of all that.

{% quote Self-organized doesn't mean un-organized %}

**Principle #12**:
"At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly."

That's a great principle, which is translated into so-called retrospective
meetings. They work just fine, provided the decisions made at them are
making the team better. Unfortunately, in most cases, programmers in Agile teams are
trying to [survive]({% pst 2015/oct/2015-10-06-how-to-be-good-office-slave %}),
instead of making their teams more effective. Even though the
principle says that the team has to become more effective, that retrospective
meetings help programmers to become more effective (read "more secure") inside
the team. That's only natural for people, but leads to the overall degradation
of the team. It's well known that the best team is the one that is capable of
[rejecting]({% pst 2015/sep/2015-09-16-how-to-fire-someone-right %})
bad elements quickly and inevitably. Does your team do that effectively?
Retrospective meetings help in that? I doubt it. Thus, I believe that
what the Manifesto means here is not the meetings. It means that the team must have
an effective mechanism of self-regulation and self-improvement. And retrospective
meetings simply can't be that mechanism, because they prevent the team to make
difficult disciplinary decisions.
