  The very attempt to estimate a software project
  has fundamental flaws and can't be done right; instead,
  we should estimate different parameters.

"Here is the specification, how much will it cost to create this software?"
I hear this almost every day from clients of [Teamed.io](http://www.teamed.io)
and prospects that are planning to become our clients and outsource the software
development to us. My best answer is "_I don't know, it depends._"
Sounds like a strange response for someone who claims
he knows what he is doing, isn't it? Here is the 20-pages specification,
it explains all the features of the product, how come you can't estimate
the cost? I can, but I won't. Here is why.

<!--more-->

Let me ask you something else &mdash; **why do you need an estimate?**
Yes, I mean it &mdash; why do you ask me how much will it cost
to develop the software for you? I can tell you why.

Because you don't trust me.

And obviously you have all good reasons for that. Simply because we both
know that a software product is something that can stay in-development forever
and will never be finished. Look at YouTube, for example. How much, do you think,
it will take to create a website like this, where users are able to
upload their videos and then stream them? A few days for a good web developer.
Will it stream video? Yes, it will. Will it be ready to compete with YouTube?
No, it won't. Add a few hundred developers to the team, a few years, and a
few million dollars and even then you will be behind YouTube. Simply because
it's a never-ending process. Any software, no matter how big/good it is,
always needs more and more improvements and bug fixes.

Thus, when you ask me how much will it cost to create a system similar
to YouTube, according to your specifications, my honest and accurate answer
should be &mdash; "_all of your money and this won't be enough._" Will you
sign a contract and outsource the project to me after than answer? No, you won't.
That's why I have to lie and promise something like "three months and $40K".
Why would you trust me? If you're smart enough, you won't.

My point is that no matter what I promise you, I will be wrong. Terribly wrong.

What is the solution? What to do? I totally understand that you
do need a number, to make your plans and secure the money.
You need to choose the right software outsourcing partner and you
need to know what to expect and when, but...

You're asking the **wrong question**!

This question has only one valid answer and it's the answer nobody
will ever give you &mdash; the development will take forever and will
digest all of your money. All other answers are simply a lie.

I'm sorry if I brought bad news to you.

But let's get back to the original problem &mdash; why are you asking
me how much will it take to develop the software if you know that
it's a never ending process and there is basically no limit? Because you
you want to make sure that your $40,000 will be used the right way and will
produce the maximum they can produce. To get this assurance from me, you're
asking for an estimate. I'm telling you that your software will be ready
in $40K and you sleep well. Until the moment you realize that you've been
fooled. By your own self.

Your concern is perfectly valid. You do want to spend no more than $40K and you want
to get a product that will let you achieve your business goals. For example,
to get to the market and acquire first few thousand users. In other words,
your biggest worry is that your dollars will be turned into the right amount
of right software.

Any software team can consume your $40K, but each team will produce different
_amount_ of software with different _quality_.

My point is that instead of asking how much will a software cost, you should
ask how much software we can create for each dollar you give us and what
will be the quality of it.

In other words, don't ask us to estimate how much gas will it take to get
to the finish line. Because there is no finish line. Instead, ask us
how much do we charge per gallon and how many gallons we consume per mile.

Different teams use different metrics to measure their results
(to be honest, most of them don't use any). We, in
[Teamed.io](http://www.teamed.io), use
[hits-of-code]({% pst 2014/nov/2014-11-14-hits-of-code %}),
bugs, pull requests, test coverage and a few other metrics
as measurable indicators of _quantity and quality_. We know exactly how much
software we can produce for each $100 you pay us.

Collect that numbers from other teams and compare them. Also, make sure
you can control these numbers during the course of the project. That's the
guarantee you're looking for. Now you know what you're buying and how
much you're pa ying for it. In other words, like I said above, having these
numbers in front of you, you will be sure that your money are producing
the maximum amount of software they can produce, with the highest quality.

The only question left is how can you know that you're buying
the right software? In other words, you know how much
we charge per gallon and how much gallons we spend per mile, but
how do you know that we're driving the right direction and not making
too many circles or detours?

There is only one mechanism to guarantee that &mdash; regular check-points.
You should ask us whether we deliver the software in small and regular
increments and whether we allow you do regular
[indepenent reviews]({% pst 2014/dec/2014-12-18-independent-technical-reviews %})
of our progress. Also, make sure that we prioritize our technical goals,
use milestones, versionalize releases, publish release notes, etc.
Make sure that in the course of our journey you will be able to control
the progress and make corrections.

To summarize, this is wrong (because their is no "there"):

> Hey, driver, how much will it cost to get there?

And this is right:

> Hey, driver, how much do you charge per mile and
am I allowed to look at the window and correct you?

Hope I made my point clear :)
