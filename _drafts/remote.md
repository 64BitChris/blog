  Working remotely doesn't solve the key problem of
  modern management&mdash;lack of motivation for results&mdash;but
  only makes things worse.

Working remotely is definitely a trend, according to
[BLS](https://www.bls.gov/opub/ted/2016/24-percent-of-employed-people-did-some-or-all-of-their-work-at-home-in-2015.htm)
and my personal observations.
"Let them work from home"
seems to be the silver bullet for
every second startup and even some big companies, like
[Buffer](https://open.bufferapp.com/remote-team-connect/),
[Automattic](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/billion-dollar-tech-company-offices-email-glenn-leibowitz),
[Groove](https://www.groovehq.com/blog/remote-work-tips)
and
[many others](https://www.forbes.com/sites/laurashin/2017/01/31/work-from-home-in-2017-the-top-100-companies-offering-remote-jobs/).
However, in most cases, a replacement of a brick-and-mortar office with a virtual one
doesn't help companies and their <del>slaves</del> employees
become more productive.

Working from home, also known as working from anywhere,
working remotely, or simply telecommuting, usually means four
radical changes:

  * First, we replace office security cameras on the ceiling with screen
    **monitoring** software and/or web cameras constantly watching us.
    [Upwork does](https://support.upwork.com/hc/en-us/articles/211064098-Log-Time-with-the-Upwork-Desktop-App-)
    it to their thousands of <del>monkeys</del> freelancers,
    requiring them to install a background screen capturer
    and make sure it is running during the entire working time.

  * Second, we replace meeting rooms with conference software,
    like [Zoom](https://zoom.us/) or good old [Skype](https://www.skype.com/en/),
    and [learn](https://hbr.org/2015/03/how-to-run-a-great-virtual-meeting)
    how to make **virtual meetings** productive. The main principle is similar to
    the one we use in traditional meetings: make it fun. Otherwise we will
    switch to Facebook or PokerStars while the manager is
    still <del>acting</del> talking in her window.

  * Third, we replace Post-it stickies and Scrum boards with tickets and
    tasks in [Trello](https://trello.com/)
    or [any other](https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-best-alternatives-to-Trello)
    **task tracker**.
    We keep everybody busy learning that tools and filling them with data.

  * Forth, and the most important one, we replace office chit-chats with
    [**Slack**](https://slack.com/) channels or [HipChat](https://www.hipchat.com/) groups.
    Instead of being in the office at 9am
    everybody will have an ability to demonstrate the level of their
    [presenteeism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presenteeism) using emojis.

Your life, as a developer, will be very different in a team that
works remotely. It will be full of real freedom. However, there will be
certain problems:

**Harder to Prove Innocence**.
How does your manager know that you're actually working,
not watching TV, playing with your kids, or grooming your favorite
open source pets? In the office it's easier: you just sit in front of the monitor
and the boss is happy. At home or in a coffee shop you are guilty by
default, until you prove the opposite by creating new tickets,
posting emojis to Slack, and sending emails with multiple CC's.

**Harder to Find Information**.
In the office you can always ask your question out loud and
the most knowledgeable person helps you. Remotely, however, you will have
to search some wiki pages, Google Docs,
and, God forbids, Git logs. Be prepared that almost nobody
will be interested in sharing knowledge or teaching you remotely&mdash;what
is the point, if nobody sees him doing it? You will be on your own
in front of that one-year old documentation made by someone fired
right after writing it up.

**Harder to Avoid Overtime**.
In the office you just walk away with everybody else when time is up. Remotely
you will have phone calls and Slack discussions in the middle of the night on Sunday,
especially if the team is distributed across multiple time zones. Everybody
will expect 24x7 availability, since you're working from home. And changing
the status to "Do not disturb" in Skype will only offend them and seriously
damage your reputation. In a work-from-home environment good programmers are
those who are always online.

**Harder to Defend Yourself**.
You won't know where to expect the next trouble from. In the office it's easier,
you can visually observe the territory, smell conflicts in the air, see
how people move, what they talk about, and who is the next victim. Remotely
you're sitting in an isolation, extracting pieces of information from Slack.
You can easily become the next victim without even noticing it. Simply put,
they will stab you in the back while you're writing Java and thinking
about a new unit test.

**Harder Not to Waste Time**.
It sounds counter-intuitive, but sitting home you waste much more time
than in the office. Meetings will be called more frequently and they will
be less effective, thanks to constant troubles with scheduling, quality of
connection, software failures, and, of course, lack of online communication
skills. The manager will call more meetings mostly in order to convince
himself that the team is actually working: hearing your voice many times a day is
a perfect confirmation that you are busy and he is a good manager.

On a more serious note, I believe that working remotely
only makes things _worse_ when the motivation of the team
is still based on [hourly pay]({% pst 2015/jul/2015-07-21-hourly-pay-modern-slavery %}).
A slave working remotely is still a slave. Moreover, it's a slave that
is harder to manage and control. First, we have to switch to results-based
payment model and then go remote. Actually, remote work will happen automatically
right after everybody starts getting their paychecks for the results they
deliver, not the time they spend. They will simply stop showing up in the office,
but their results will keep coming to the project,
without any web cameras or Slack channels.

No surprise, many big companies have already decided to stop this telecommuning
nonsense and put their slaves back behind closed doors; take
