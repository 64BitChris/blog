  We put those who break our laws to jail. Why don't

If I drive too fast and they catch me, I may get a ticket. If I drive
under influence, and they catch me, I may go to jail. If I turn
radio too loud in the middle of the night, my neighbours call police
and I may get into trouble, if I don't stop. The law basically protects
us from making trouble to each other. Why don't we have a law
against **irresponsible coding**?

Software is part of my life. It actually **is** my **life**, not just part of it. I stare
at this MacBook much more time every day than I drive, talk or listen
to the radio.

The code is the **territory** where I
[interfere]({% pst 2014/oct/2014-10-07-stop-chatting-start-coding %})
with others. This is where
we may bother each other. Irresponsible coding is exactly how one
of us can really disturb another one. So why **police** is is not protecting
me against, say, authors of Apache Hadoop?

They created something that turns part of my life into a nightmare. Much
faster and much more severely than that drunk drivers. So, where is
the police? Why they are not protecting me, for my tax dollars? Why
that Java guys are not in **jail** yet? :)

We need a law against irresponsible coding!

How about two months imprisonment for a
