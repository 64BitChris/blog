You have a task, assigned to you, and you don't like it. You are simply
not in the mood. You don't know how to fix that bug. You have no idea
how that bloody module was designed and you don't know how it works. But
you have to fix that bug, which was reported by someone who has no clue how
this software works. You get frustrated, you blame that stupid project manager and
already-fired programmers. You spend hours just to find out
how things work. Then, more hours trying to fix. In the end,
you miss the deadline and everybody blames you. Been there, done that?

However, there is also a professional exit from this situation.
Here are some tips I recommend to my peer programmers working with me
in [teamed.io](http://www.teamed.io) projects, managed by
[XDSD methodology]({% pst 2014/apr/2014-04-17-how-xdsd-is-different %}).
In a nutshell, I'm going to explain how you can **cut corners** and stay
professional, 1) saving your nerves, 2) optimizing project's expenses,
and 3) increasing the quality of the source code.
