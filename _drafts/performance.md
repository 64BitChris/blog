Twenty years ago, the best programmer was the one
capable of fitting an entire application into a 64Kb
`.COM` file. Those who were able to get the maximum
from that poor Intel 80386 were icons of programming.

Twenty years ago computers were expensive and programmers
were cheap. That was the time of "hacker mentality".
This time is over. This mentality is not appreciated any more,

Today, computers are cheap and programmers are expensive.
This is the era of "designer mentality", when readability
of our code is much more important than its performance or
compactness.
