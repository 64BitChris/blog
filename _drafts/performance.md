  Twenty years ago we worried about performance. Now
  it is time to worry about maintainability, even though
  it may compromise the performance

Twenty years ago, the best programmer was the one
capable of fitting an entire application into a 64Kb
`.COM` file. Those who were able to get the maximum
from that poor Intel 80386 were icons of programming.

Twenty years ago computers were expensive and programmers
were cheap. That was the time of "hacker mentality".
This time is over. This mentality is not appreciated any more,
because the market situation is completely opposite.

Today, computers are cheap and programmers are expensive.
This is the era of "designers mentality", when readability
of our code is much more important than its performance or
compactness.

Let's compare some numbers. This is what we had in 1994,
which is exactly twenty years from now (btw, I was writing in C
and Assembly that time).

In 1993, Dell was selling a top-of-the-line 486
with a 66MHz processor, eight megabytes of RAM and
a 320-megabyte hard drive for $4,400.
