I was explaining how Zerocracy works to one of the prospects
yesterday. In the end, he made the decision and this is what he said
"[In Zerocracy] there is no commitment and anybody is free to leave any time,
so the risk of confiding a highly important project to such
a platform and failing to deliver it on time is very high.
We will develop it on our own with hired developers who
would have their salaries, and me as architect and project manager,
that way it would be under our entire control."
