I wrote a number of [sarcastic articles](tag/sarcasm.html)
about management and motivation, where traditional and very popular
practices were criticized. Now I decided to think it all over
and summarize want actually _motivates_ me as a programmer, when I'm
working for someone. Let's say you hire me tomorrow as a Java coder
and ask "What do you want us to do for you so
that you would be the most productive?" This would be my wish list.

<!--more-->

The list goes without any particular order.

**Remote work**.
I like to be in the office, but I hate when I have to be there from 9 till 5.
It's very important for me to have an ability to work from where
I want. Most companies declare that, but in reality I will have to "inform" you
every time I decide to stay home. Instead, I want to inform
you when I decide to visit the office. In other words, my default state
should be "not in the office."

**Isolation of tasks**.
I hate being responsible for someone's mistakes and I'm not really a good team player.
I want to solve problems on my own and be responsible for my own
success and failures. That's why clearly defined and isolated tasks motivate
me and help me stay focused and interested. I want to see them in writing
(as tickets) and I want to know exactly what is my definition of done.
Simply put, what should I do in order for a task to be considered as
completed? ле

**Responsibility borders**.
I hate to be afraid, especially if I don't really know what I have to be
afraid of. I want to know what are my possible punishments and when will they
occur. I need to know the rules of the game. Say, I commit a bug into
the code and we lose $100,000. What will happen to me? Or I don't finish the
task on the deadline. Or I don't answer the email. Or I miss a bug during
a code review. Or I break the `master` branch. What are the consequences?
Their clear explanation will seriously boost my motivation.

**Open source**.
I'm a big fan of open source. If you are not, I most probably won't like to
work for you. If your company makes some code open and I will be part of
this process, that will seriously affect my motivation, because I will achieve
two goals at the same time: make money and become more popular in the
open source world. Working in purely closed software projects is a demotivating
factor for me.

**Project visibility**.
I'd love to see my name close to a project that is visible to the world.
And it must not necessarily be Google or Facebook. Actually, in that companies
regular programmers are way less visible than in smaller startups. So, unless
you make me a VP/Engineering, I won't consider a position
in a big company interesting in that aspect. The most interesting project
would be a small startup with an ambitious goal and high exposure in media.
Being there even as a regular programmer will motivate me a lot.

**Clear hierarchy**.
Yes, I've heard about
[holacracy]({% pst 2016/feb/2016-02-18-holacracy-autocracy %}),
[flat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flat_organization) and
[self-managing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flat_organization#Self-managing_teams) teams, and
other modern ideas. I hate them all. I believe that any management is based
on
[power and force]({% pst 2016/sep/2016-09-27-command-control-innovate %}),
and the best way to avoid negative aspects of these
rather violent concepts is to organize them. Without a clear and well defined
hierarchy of roles a team very quickly turns into a
[snake pit]({% pst 2015/oct/2015-10-13-competition-without-rules %}), with
politics, back stabbing and behind-the-scene games. So, if you can't tell me
exactly who is my boss and what is the chain of command in the group, I
simply won't consider this place seriously and won't be motivated.

**No Agile/Scrum, please**.
Do I need to say
[anything]({% pst 2016/jul/2016-07-11-mistakes-in-agile-manifesto %})
else here?

**Payment structure**.
I hate to guess about money, I prefer to know the numbers and the logic
behind them. I want to know exactly how much I'm going to get and when.
I want to know when the numbers will go up and how I can affect that. Also,
I'd like to know the payment policy of the company and, ideally, salaries
or rates of people around me. Jealosy, which comes together with a
surprising information that someone is getting more than I do, doesn't
motivate at all, even if my pay is decent. It would be much easier for me
if I would know everything from the first day.

**Business transparency**.
I hate working for big ideas, if they are not mine. Mostly because I know
that almost all of them
[fail]({% pst 2016/jan/2016-01-12-good-programmers-dont-work-for-equity %}).
Working for a failure and being told that
our future is bright doesn't really motivates me, at all. That's why I would
expect you to tell me honestly why a meeting with investors took three hours
instead of one and why the door was so tightly closed. Also, I would be
willing to know why our CTO quit a few weeks ago and now works for our
competitors. Also, I'd like to know our honest situation on the market,
and why the web traffic stats are going down. In other words,
I'm either a [slave]({% pst 2015/oct/2015-10-06-how-to-be-good-office-slave %})
kept in the dark, or I know
[the truth]({% pst 2015/mar/2015-03-02-team-morale-myths-and-reality %}) and I'm motivated
(no matter how ugly is the truth).

**Payments per results**.
I haven't seen that anywhere, except my own projects, but I believe that's how
good teams should be structured: everybody must be paid
[for results]({% pst 2015/jul/2015-07-21-hourly-pay-modern-slavery %}),
not per hour/week/month/year. If you want me to be truly motivated, you have to
invent a payment structure where my paychecks will correspond to my results.
I do realize that this may require you to change the entire management
system, so don't really insist. But you have to remember that as long as
you pay me for the time I will try to do my best to <del>steal from you</del> use
it for my own benefit.

**Career path**.
I have no problem starting as a junior developer, but I have to know exactly
what is my future and when will it happen. I want to become a CTO, no matter
what. And it's not about the title, but about the amount of technical
[authority]({% pst 2014/oct/2014-10-12-who-is-software-architect %}) and
[responsibility]({% pst 2015/may/2015-05-11-software-architect-responsibilities %})
I will have. I want it all. If I don't see a clear path to
achieve that, I will be very demotivated and will treat my job as
temporary. I will always be looking for a [better place]({% pst 2017/jan/2017-01-24-career-advice %}),
where it's easier
to become a CTO. So, it's your job to make that career growth obvious for me.
If it will never be possible to become a CTO, say so too. The truth is
better anyway.

**A strong boss**.
This is probably the most important requirement I would have. I can't work
under a weak manager, this will seriously demotivate me from the first day.
I will probably write another blog post about who is that "strong manager,"
but in a nutshell it's someone who is ready to fight for his or her
own ideas, rights, thoughts, decisions, etc. A weak manager is the one who is
swimming with the current. Working under such a manager is a huge
frustration and a waste of time. I will be demotivated and no money will
hold me back.

Of course, I don't think that this list is applicable for everybody. Other programmers
may have some other points or may disagree with mine.
