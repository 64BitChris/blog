[Here](http://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html) it is:
"Build projects around motivated individuals.
Give them the environment and support they need,
and trust them to get the job done."
First, I found myself totally disagreeing with it.
Then, after a few minutes of thinking I realized that it is absolutely
in line with what [Zerocracy](https://www.zerocracy.com) is preaching.

First, why I though that I'm against it. Because of this part:
"trust them to get the job done." I believe that trust, if it's
a replacement of control, is an obvious sign of management weakness.
I [wrote]({% pst 2017/nov/2017-11-21-trust-pay-lose %}) about it recently.
The more you trust, the more you eventually lose.
