Recently I said a few words in my Telegram group about "women in tech,"
which lead to some negative reaction on Twitter. I believe I owe my readers
an explanation. Some of them already got confused and came to me with
the question: "You're so much against slavery, where this male
chauvinism is coming from?" Let me explain what's going on. Indeed,
I'm a big fan of freedom, but recent hysteria around gender equality
is not helping us to become more free, instead causing quite
the opposite effect.

When I was a kid my parents and my teachers told me that I had to be
a gentleman. That literally meant that I had to treat women with respect
and always remember that they were weaker than us men&mdash;physically
and emotionally.

I had to open the door in front of them, I was not allowed to fight with them
as I did with my boyfriends, I was punished for cursing in
front of them, and many other things. I did all that not only because
of the teaching, but also cause I saw that they indeed were weaker. They were
phisycally and emotionally different from us boys. They played dolls,
we played wars. They wore pink and white skirts and blouses, we wore
shorts and t-shirts. They cried when someone was offending them and
we were supposed to be stronger, never cry and protect them. It was always
obvious that we were the trouble makers, but also the protectors that
little creatures eventually one day will entrust their lives to.

Now it seems that I was raised as a sexist. Do I feel ashamed? Not at all.

Do I believe that gender equality is about making men and women
fully equal in all life aspects? Not at all.

We must _not_ be equal, because we are different.

And there are many other categories of people in modern societies, which
possess special rights or are not allowed to do certain things. Simply put,
they are discriminated, for good. For example, kids are not allowed to
buy alcohol and watch porn. Senior citizens receive pension
even though they don't work anymore. People with disabilities
sit in a bus where everybody else is not allowed to. Such _inequalities_ are only
making us humans. We need them.

The same is true for that special category of people I was taught to respect
and protect: women. And no matter what extreme feminists say, I will
remain the same. I do believe in inequality between men and women. I want
to see us as gentlemen and ladies. Not just gender-less people.

Thanks to that inequality men find women attractive, fall in love with them,
marry them and make kids. Thanks to that inequality many years ago my dad asked
my mon out, kissed her, proposed, and helped me meet this world.

Now back to the main problem: women in tech. I'm a programmer myself,
I write and debug code every day. I also manage programmers and projects.
My 20+ years of experience in coding tells me that this job is not fun
most of the time. It's hard, it requires a lot of rigid logical thinking,
it's rather boring, and it's a constant war against machines and other
programmers, who produce unmaintainable and unreadable code.

I don't feel good about sending women, who I was raised to protect and respect,
to that war. I also personally don't like the idea of women being police officers,
soldiers, surgeons, or firefighters, even though it's not up to me to decide
what they do for a living. That jobs are stressful and dangerous, both
physically and emotionally. Not that I believe that women can't take this
stress, I just don't want them to suffer. There are plenty of gentlemen who can do that
instead.

Do I respect women who write code on a daily basis? Yes, a lot. Because I understand
how much stress they have to go through. Would I recommend my girlfriend to do
the same. I don't think so.

Am I a sexist? Maybe so. But that's how I was raised, that's who I am.
