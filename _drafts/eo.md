It's time to do it! We started to work on a new programming language. It's
name is **EO** (as in "Elegant Objects"): [eolang.org](http://www.eolang.org).
It's open source and community driven:
[yegor256/eo](https://github.com/yegor256/eo) GitHub repo. It's still a
very early draft, but the direction is more or less clear: it has to be
truly object-oriented, no compromises. You're welcome to join us.

<!--more-->

Why yet another language? Because there are no object-oriented languages
on the market that are really object-oriented, to may knowledge. Here is
what I think do not belong to a pure object-oriented language:

  * static methods
  * classes (only types and objects)
  * implementation inheritance
  * mutability
  * NULL
  * reflection
  * constants
  * type casting
  * annotations
  * operators (`for`, `while`, `if`, etc)

And many other minor mistakes Java and C++ are full of.

At the moment we think that EO will compile into Java. Not into byte-code,
but into `.java` files, later compilable to byte-code.

I really count on your contribution. Please, submit your ideas as
tickets and pull request to
[yegor256/eo](https://github.com/yegor256/eo) GitHub repo.
