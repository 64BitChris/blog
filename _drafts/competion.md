  motivation.

When your team is choosing which technical decision to make,
who has the final say? When one of your colleagues asks
for a raise, who decides and what his or her decision is based on?
When it's necessary to work overtime, how it's decided
who should stay in the office?
I'm expecting you to shrug shoulders. You're right, these questions never
have explicit answers in modern organizations. We are used to work
in a more "democratic" way, where such decisions are made
**subjectively**, by managers or just more senior employees.
Is this how it should be?

We are trying to **avoid explicity** in these sensitive subjects. Indeed,
how can we tell Jeff that his salary is lower than the one
of Monica because his performance is worse?
This will definitely lead to depression and negativity
in the team, right?

What I'm trying to say is that **we don't set rules**. We think that
strict and explicit rules, related to their performance,
offend creative people. Well, all people.

We avoid explicity in performance appraisal.

And this is totally wrong!

This is a **mistake** and it causes big problems!

When a group doesn't have explicitly defined principles of
survival and growth, it starts to create them, **naturally**. When
people don't know what exactly needs to be done in order to get
a 15% raise, they get this information anyway. Guess what
this information will be about? Right &mdash; you have
[to make your boss happy]({% pst 2015/jan/2015-01-26-happy-boss-false-objective %})
and that's how your chances for a raise get higher.

Instead of working towards the goals set by the organization,
we are fighting with each other for the attention of our boss.
Instead of focusing on the results and their quality, we
are reading the mood of our manager. Our fear becomes a guide for us.

Competition is **inevitable** in a group. Especially if the group consists
of creative people. Creativity is all about competition. Each of us
wants to be better than others and this is what drives **innovations**.
But, if the team has no rules, even a minor competition seriously
and negatively affects motivation.

If you want your team be creative and productive, clearly and explicitly
define rules of competition. Make sure everybody at any time can get a clear
and straight-forward answers to, for example, these questions:

  * Who is the best developer in our team?

  * Why my salary is lower than Jeff's?

  * What I need to do in order to get a raise?

  * On what conditions will I be fired?

Can you ask these questions in your team and get explicit answers?
