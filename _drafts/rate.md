I'm getting a few emails every day from programmers
interested to work with us remotely. The first question I usually
ask is "what is your rate?" What surprises me is how
often people under-estimate and over-estimate themselves.

I hear very different numbers, from $5 to $500 per hour. I never
say no, but usually come up with my own estimate. This article
explains what factors I do and don't take into account. These are
my personal criteria, don't take them as an industry standard. However,
I find them logical and I'll try to explain that logic.

## +1 Open Source Contribution

This is the first and the most important characteristic of a
software developer. Do you contribute to open source projects?
Do you have your own open source libraries that are used by
the community? Do you write code that is publicly available and used?

If you have nothing to show here, I see three posible causes.

You're **too shy to share** your code because **it's crap**. This is
not a good sign for me.

You work from nine till five, for food, **without passion**. Actually,
nobody manifest it that way. Instead, I often hear something like
"my company doesn't pay me for open source contribution and
at home I want to spend time with my family".

You don't know what to write and where to contribute.
