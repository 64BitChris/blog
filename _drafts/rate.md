I'm getting a few emails every day from programmers
interested to work with [Teamed.io](http://www.teamed.io) remotely.
The first question I usually ask is "what is your rate?"
(we pay [by the hour]({% pst 2014/apr/2014-04-17-how-xdsd-is-different %}))
What surprises me is how
often people incorrectly estimate themselves, in both directions.

I hear very different numbers, from $5 to $500 per hour. I never
say no, but usually come up with my own estimate. This article
explains what factors I do and don't take into account. These are
my personal criteria, don't take them as an industry standard.
I find them objective and logical &mdash; let me explain.

## Open Source Contribution

This is the first and the most important characteristic of a
software developer. Do you contribute to open source projects?
Do you have your own open source libraries that are used by
some community? Do you write code that is publicly available and used?

If you have nothing to show here, I see three posible causes.

First, you're **too shy to share** your code because **it's crap**. Obviously,
this is not a good sign. Not because your code could be bad, but because
you're not brave enough to face this fact and improve. In our teams we
[pay a lot of attention]({% pst 2014/aug/2014-08-13-strict-code-quality-control %})
to the quality of code and most of our
new team members got surprised by how high is our quality bar. You will also
be surprised. The question is whether you will be able to adopt and improve
or you will give up and quit. If you didn't share your code before
and never dealt with a negative feedback, you won't feel comfortable
in our projects, where quality requirements are very high.

Second possible cause is that
you work from nine till five, for food, **without passion**. Actually,
nobody manifests it that way. Instead, I often hear something like
"my company doesn't pay me for open source contribution and
at home I want to spend time with my family". In a modern software
development most of the code we're working with is open source &mdash;
libraries, frameworks, tools, instruments, etc. Almost everything you're using
in your commercial projects is open source. By paying your salary your
employer does already invest into open source products,
because you're an active user of them. The problem is that *you* are not
interested to become more active in that contribution.
I see it as a lack of passion and self-motivation.
Will you be an effective developer in our projects? Not at all, because our
entire management model relies on [self-motivation]({% pst 2014/apr/2014-04-17-how-xdsd-is-different %}).

The last possible cause is that
you don't know what to write and where to contribute, which means
**lack of creativity**. As I mentioned above, almost everything we're using
now is open source, and it is full of bugs and not-yet-implemented features.
At the same time, you don't see any areas for improvement? You don't
know what can be done better? You're not able to at least find, report and fix
a bug in some open source product you're using every day? This means
that you won't be able to find areas of improvement in our projects as well,
while we rely on your ability to
[discover problems creatively]({% pst 2014/apr/2014-04-13-bugs-are-welcome %}).

Thus, if your Github account is empty and your CV doesn't position yourself
as "an active contributor to Linux kernel" (yeah, why not?), I immediately
lose interest. On the other hand, when I see a 100+ stars project in your
Github account, I get excited and ready to offer a higher rate.

## Georgraphic Location

It is a common practice to pay higher rates to those who live in more
expensive countries. When I'm getting resumes from San Francisco programmers,
their rates are $70+ per hour. Same skills and experience cost
$15-20 in Karachi. The reason here is the cost of life &mdash;
it is much higher in the US than in Pakistan.

However, this reason doesn't sound logical to me. If you're driving a more
expensive car, we have to pay you a higher salary? The same with the
place to stay. You've chosen the country that
you live in. You're using all the benefits of a well-developed country
and you're paying for them. It's your choice. You decided to spend more money
for the quality of your life &mdash; what it has to do with me?

Want to pay $30 for a lunch? Become a better engineer. Until then,
buy a hot dog for a few bucks. Just saying that
"I'm already here and my lunch costs $30" is not an argument.

Thus, the more expensive is the place where you live, the less money will
stay in your pocket. For us it means that $100 will motivate a programmer
from Karachi much stronger than the same $100 will motivate the same person,
if she would live in San Francisco. Thus, we prefer to work with people
whose expenses are lower. Our money will simply work better.

## StackOverflow.com Reputation

We all know what StackOverflow is but very few people (suprisingly few!)
actively contribute to it. If your profile there is empty (or you don't have
one) I realize that you 1) don't have any questions to ask
and 2) you have nothing to answer.

First, if you're not asking anything there, you are not growing. Your education
process stopped some time ago, probably right after you got an office job.
Or maybe you're too shy to ask? Or you can't describe your questions
in an accurate and precise format? Or maybe all your questions already
have answers? In either case, it's sad.

Second, if you're not answering, you simply have nothing to say. In most cases
this means that you're not solving complex and unique problems.
You're simply wiring together well-known components and
collect your paychecks.

Very often I hear people saying that they solve most of their problems
by asking their colleagues sitting next to them in the office. They say
they simply don't need StackOverflow (or similar resources, if they exist)
because their team is so great that any questions can be answered internally.
That's good for the team and bad for you. You don't have a very important skill
of finding an answer in a public Internet. In our projects we
[discourage]({% pst 2014/oct/2014-10-07-stop-chatting-start-coding %})
any horizontal communications between programmers, and you won't be
able to get any help from anyone. You will be on your own and you will fail,
because you used to be patronized by someone senior, in your office.

StackOverflow is not just an indicator of how smart you are and how many
upvotes you for got for the ["best programming joke"](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/234075/what-is-your-best-programmer-joke).
It is a proof that you can find answers
to your questions by communicating with people you don't know.
It is a very important skill.

## Years of Experience

"I'm writing Java for 10 years!" &mdash; so what? This number means only
one thing to me &mdash; you managed to survive in some office for ten years.
Or maybe in a few offices. You managed to convience someone that he
has to pay you for ten years of sitting in his building. Does it mean
that you were writing something useful?
Does it mean that your code was perfect? It doesn't mean anything of that.

Years of experience is a false indicator. It actually may play against yourself,
in combination with other indicators mentioned above. If your CV says that
you just started to program two years ago and your Github
and StackOverflow accounts are empty &mdash; there is still a chance
you will improve. You're just in the beginning of your career. However,
if your CV says that you're a "10-years seasoned architect" with zero
open source contribution &mdash; this means that either you're lying about
your that ten years or you're absolutely useless as an architect.

My point is that "years of experience" argument should be used very carefully.
Play this card only if you have other merits. Otherwise, keep it to yourself.

## Certifications

Oracle, Zend, Amazon, IBM, MySQL, etc. &mdash;
I'm talking about these certifications. In order to get them you should
pass an exam. Not an easy one and not online. It is a real exam taken in
a certification center, where you're sitting in front of a computer for a few
hours, without any books or Internet access, answering questions. Rather
humiliating activity for a respected software developer? Indeed. And there
is a high probability of failure, which is also rather embarassing.

It is a very good sign, if you managed to go through this. If you've done
it a few times, even better. However, if you earned no certifications
in your entire career, it is one of the following reasons:

First, you're **afraid to lose**. A serious certification may cost a few hundred
dollars (I paid over $700 for [SCEA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_Certification_Program))
and you will not get a refund if you
fail. If you're afraid to lose, you're afraid to fight. This means,
you'll chicken out in a real-life situation, where a complex problem
will need to be solved.

Second, you **don't invest** into your profile. This most probably means that you don't
want to change companies and prefer to find a peaceful office, where you
can stay forever. I remember I said once to a friend of mine &mdash;
"you will greately improve your CV if you pass this certification". He
answered with a smile &mdash; "I hope I won't need a CV any more, I like
this company". This attitude is very beneficial for the company you're
working for, but it is definitely against you.

In my experience, the best team players are those who work for themselves.
Healthy individualism is a key success factor. If your primary objective
is to earn for yourself (money, reputation, skills, or knowledge) &mdash;
you will be very effective in our projects. Certifications in your
profile is an indicator of that healthy individualism we're looking for.

## Skills Variety

The more technologies or programming languages you know the less you cost.
I'm not saying that it's not possible to be an expert in many things at the same time
&mdash; it is obvious. I'll give you a more pragmatic reason &mdash;
competition. There are thousands of "Java7 programmers" on the market &mdash;
we can easily choose whoever we need. But there are not so many
"Hadoop programmers" or "XSLT designers".

If you focus yourself on some specific area and become an expert there,
your chances to find a job are lower, but the money you will get is bigger.
We're usually paying more to narrow-skilled specialists, mostly because
we have no choice. If a project we're working on needs a Lucene expert,
we'll find the right person and will try to do our best to get him/her on
board. Doing our best means increasing the price, in most cases.

Thus, when I'm hearing that you're "experienced in MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle and Sqlite"
I realize that you know very little about databases.

## Talks and Publications

I think it is obvious that having a blog (about programming, not about
your favorite cat) is a positive factor. Even better is to be an
occasional speaker at conferences or meetups. When it is a blog, I
pay attention to the amount of comments people leave for your articles.
If it is a conference, the most important criteria is how difficult it
was to get to the list of speakers.

Both blog articles and conference presentations make you much more
valuable as a specialist. Mostly because they demonstrate that some
people already reviewed your work and your talent. And it was not just
a single employer, but a group of other programmers and engineers.
This means that we also can rely on your opinions.

Besides that, if you write and present regularly, you have a very important
skill/talent &mdash; you can present your ideas in a "digestable" way.
In our project we
[discourage informal communications]({% pst 2014/oct/2014-10-07-stop-chatting-start-coding %})
and use ticketing systems instead. In that tickets you will have
to explain your ideas, questions or concerns so that everybody will
understand you. Without enough presentation skills you won't survive
in your projects.

BTW, some software developers even file patents in their names &mdash; why
can't you do this?

## Previous Employment

I usually don't pay much attention to this section of your CV. Our management
model is [so different]({% pst 2014/apr/2014-04-17-how-xdsd-is-different %})
from anything you can see anywhere else that it doesn't really matter
how many times you were fired before and how senior
position you have/had with your full-time employer. Even if your title
is "CTO of Twitter" &mdash; it doesn't mean anything to me.

My experience tells me that the bigger the company and the higher the position
in it &mdash; the further away you stay from the source code and from
real technical decisions. Most of the time these VPs and CTOs are spending for
management meetings and internal politics.

I'm much more interested in **what** you've done over the last years than
in **where** you've done it and how did you they call you while you were
doing it.

## Education

BSc, MSc, PhD... do we care? Not really. Education is very similar to
the "previous employment" mentioned above.

## Rates

**$100+** per hour we gladly pay to an expert who owns a few popular open source
products; his/her StackOverflow score is above 20K; he has certifications,
articles, presentations, and maybe even patents.

**$50+** we pay to a professional programmer who has open
source projects on his own or is an active contributor; his StackOverflow
score is over 5K; he is writing about software development; he
possesses a few certifications.

**$30+** we pay to a programmer who regularly contributes to
open source code; he is present in StackOverflow; he has some
certifications.

**$15** we pay to everybody else.

Don't get me wrong and don't take these numbers personally. The rate
you're getting is a measurable metric of your professional level not of you as a person.
Besides, the level is not static, it is changing every day, and it's entirely in your hands.

I wrote this article mostly in order to motivate you to grow.
