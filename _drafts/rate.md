I'm getting a few emails every day from programmers
interested to work with us remotely. The first question I usually
ask is "what is your rate?" What surprises me is how
often people under-estimate and over-estimate themselves.

I hear very different numbers, from $5 to $500 per hour. I never
say no, but usually come up with my own estimate. This article
explains what factors I do and don't take into account. These are
my personal criteria, don't take them as an industry standard. However,
I find them logical and I'll try to explain that logic.

## +1 Open Source Contribution

This is the first and the most important characteristic of a
software developer. Do you contribute to open source projects?
Do you have your own open source libraries that are used by
the community? Do you write code that is publicly available and used?

If you have nothing to show here, I see three posible causes.

You're **too shy to share** your code because **it's crap**. Obviously,
this is not a good sign. Not because your code could be bad, but because
you're not brave enough to face this fact and improve. In our teams we
[pay a lot of attention]({% post_url 2014/aug/2014-08-13-strict-code-quality-control %})
to the quality of code and most of our
new team members got surprised by how high is our quality bar. You will also
be surprised. The question is whether you will be able to adopt and improve
or you will give up and quit. If you didn't share your code before
and never dealt with a negative feedback, you won't feel comfortable
in a project where quality requirements are high.

You work from nine till five, for food, **without passion**. Actually,
nobody manifests it that way. Instead, I often hear something like
"my company doesn't pay me for open source contribution and
at home I want to spend time with my family". In a modern software
development most of the code we're working with is open source &mdash;
libraries, frameworks, tools, instruments, etc. Almost everything you're using
in your commercial projects is open source. By paying your salary your
employer does already invest into open source products,
because you're an active user of them. The problem is that you are not
interested to become more active. Lack of passion and self-motivation.
Will you be an effective developer in our projects? Not at all, because our
entire management model relies on self-motivation.

You don't know what to write and where to contribute, which means
**lack of creativity**. As I mentioned above, almost everything we're using
now is open source, and is full of bugs and not-yet-implemented features.
At the same time, you don't see any areas for improvement? You don't
know what can be done better? You're not able to at least find, report and fix
a bug in some open source product you're using every day? This means
that you won't be able to find areas of improvement in our projects as well,
while we rely on your ability to
[discover problems creatively]({% post_url 2014/apr/2014-04-13-bugs-are-welcome %}).

Thus, if your Github account is empty and your CV doesn't position yourself
as "an active contributor to Linux kernel" (yeah, why not?), I immediately
lose interest. On the other hand, when I see a 100+ stars project in your
Github account, I get excited and ready to offer a higher rate.
