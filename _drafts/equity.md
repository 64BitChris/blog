  Equity or cash? It seems that working for

  I don't think it's true.

"You're a good programmer. I'm a great entrepreneur. This is a
breakthrough idea. Help me build it. I don't have cash. I will
give you equity. Deal?" I hear this at least once a month. And
I always say No. Not because I don't like your idea. Indeed, it
is really interesting. Not because I'm too busy. I would
definitely find time for a good idea. Not that. I say "No" because
I don't think you're a good entrepreneur.

<!--more-->

You want a good programmer to build your product. Or maybe a group
of good programmers. And you are ready to give me some equity
in exchange. This is reasonable.

But what is your part of the deal?

How much do you put on the table?

You're saying that you're a good entrepreneur, right? How come
you don't have money? How come you can't find them to pay
for the work of a good programmer?

I will create a product for you, but you will most certainly
fail. You **already** failed. You failed to find initial
investment for the business, to cover its initial expenses.
Why will you succeed after the product is ready?

A good programmer will never work for equity. Not because a good
programmer is greedy, or doesn't want to risk, or doesn't believe
in new ideas. Not at all.

A good programmer wants to work with a **good** entrepreneur. And
a good entrepreneur knows how to find money.

Period.
