I'm a big fan of rules and discipline in software development, see for example
[Are You a Hacker or a Designer?]({% pst 2014/oct/2014-10-26-hacker-vs-programmer-mentality %}).
Also, I'm a big fan of object-oriented programming in its pureness, for example
[Seven Virtues of a Good Object]({% pst 2014/nov/2014-11-20-seven-virtues-of-good-object %}).
I'm also a co-founder and CTO of Teamed.io, a software development
company where I put my admiration of discipline and clean design into practice.

I want to encourage you to share my passion. Not just by reading this blog,
but through making real open source software, in a disciplined way.
This award is for those who is brave enough to swim against the current and
values the quality above everything else.

Send me your own project for review and take participation in the contest.

 * One person can submit up to 3 projects.

 * Submissions are accepted until the 1st of September, 2015.

 * Submissions must be sent via email to [moq@yegor256.com](mailto:moq@yegor256.com).
   All I need is your Github login and repository name. I will check commit
   history to make sure you're the main contributor to the project.

 * Any submission can be refused without explanation.

 * All submissions will be published at this page (including refused ones).

 * Results are announced on the 15th of October, at this page and by email.

 * The best project gets **$5,000**.

 * The decision is made by myself and is not negotiable
   (although, I may invite other people to help me make the right decision).

Each project must be:

 * Open source.

 * Primarily object-oriented.

What gives you higher chances of winning:

 * Strict and visible principles of design.

 * Continuous delivery.

 * Traceability of changes.

 * Self-documented source code.

 * Strict rules of code formatting.

What doesn't matter:

 * Popularity. Even if you nobody is using your
   product it is still eligible for this award. I don't care about
   popularity, but only about quality.

 * Programming language. I believe that any language, being used correctly,
   can be used to design a high quality product.

 * Buzz and trends. Even if your project is yet another parser of command
   line arguments, it's still eligible for the award. I don't care about
   your marketing position, only about quality.
