Rules:

 * One person can submit up to 3 projects.

 * Submissions are accepted until the 1st of September, 2015.

 * Submissions must be sent via email to [moq@yegor256.com](mailto:moq@yegor256.com).
   All I need is your Github login and repository name. I will check commit
   history to make sure you're the main contributor to the project.

 * Any submission can be refused without explanation.

 * All submissions will be published at this page (including refused ones).

 * Results are announced on the 15th of October, at this page and by email.

 * The best project gets $5000.

 * The decision is made by myself and is not negotiable.

Each project must be:

 * Open source.

 * At least 5K lines of code.

 * At least one year old.

What gives you higher chances of winning:

 * Strict principles of design.

 * Continuous delivery.

 * Traceability of changes.

 * Self-documented source code.

 * Strict rules of code formatting.

What doesn't matter:

 * Popularity. Even if you nobody is using your
   product it is still eligible for this award. I don't care about
   popularity, but only about quality.

 * Programming language. I believe that any language, being used correctly,
   can be used to design a high quality product.

 * Buzz and trends. Even if your project is yet another parser of command
   line arguments, it's still eligible for the award. I don't care about
   your marketing position, only about quality.

By the way, if you want to sponsor this award,
