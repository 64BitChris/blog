**CC Your Boss**.
Add your boss in a CC for as many emails as possible. The more emails
that come from you, the more valuable you are. Your boss
must see that you're actively involved in many communications and that
it's simply impossible to replace you. Besides that, CCing the boss
is a sign of respect. She or he will never forget that.

**Sigh, Don't Laugh**.
You must look very concerned about situations regarding the project, the
team, the management, the office space, and everyone's future. If you're
not concerned and laugh about it, how can you be trusted? That's a clear 
sign that you're not taking your job seriously, and who knows what you will
do tomorrow. Don't be like that. Instead, always look a bit sad.
God forbid you look happy in front of the boss.

**Care About Everything**.
No matter what the discussion is about, you care about the subject. There
is nothing involving the team that doesn't bother you. You must show that you
feel responsible for every problem and each task. Also, when there
is a discussion in the office and someone is doing his own thing, paying
no attention to the subject, you should ask, "Doesn't this concern you at all?"
Make him feel guilty for not being careful enough &mdash; that will
give you a lot of points for "being on top of all things."

**Look Tired**.
Always look a bit tired, as if you were working all night and barely got
a few hours of sleep. Also, try to make it obvious that you were fixing
some old bug in the system that nobody except you really cares about. You must not
look too energetic &mdash; this disrespects your boss. He didn't give you
enough work to wear you out completely? That means he is a bad manager. Instead,
you should even joke that "our boss knows how to keep us busy." That flattery
will definitely please even a smart person.
