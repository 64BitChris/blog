**CC Your Boss**.
Put your boss in CC at as many emails as possible. The more emails
are coming from you, the more valuable person you are. The boss
must see that you're actively involved in many communications and that
it's simply impossible to replace you. Besides that, CC'ing the boss
is a sign of respect. She or he will never forget that.

**Sigh, Don't Laugh**.
You must look very concerned about the situation with the project, the
team, the management, the office space, and the future of all of us. If you're
not concerned and laugh, how can we trust you? You're basically not taking
seriously the business we are all in together. Who knows what will
you do tomorrow... Don't be like that. Instead, always look a bit sad.
God forbid you to look happy in front of the boss.

**Care About Everything**.
No matter what the discussion is about, you care about the subject. There
is nothing in the team that doesn't bother you. You must show that you
feel responsible for every problem and each task. Also, when there
is a discussion in the office and someone is doing his own things paying
no attention to the subject you should say: "doesn't this concern you at all?"
Make them feel guilty of not being careful enough &mdash; that will
give you a lot of points for "being on top of all things."

**Look Tired**.
Always look a bit tired, as if you were working all night and barely had
a few hours sleep. Also, try to make it obvious that you were fixing
some old bug in the system, which nobody except you really care about. You must not
look too energetic &mdash; this disrespects your boss. He didn't give you
enough work to wear you out completely? That means he is a bad manager? Instead,
you should even joke that "our boss knows how to keep us busy." That flattery
will definitely please even a smart person.
