What is a "proper" object in object-oriented programming? What is not
a proper one? What is the difference? It is a very polemic subject, but
a very important one. Unless we undertand what an object is how can
we write object-oriented software? Well, we can, but will it be
an object-oriented programming?

Unfortunately, this is not an exact science. There are many opinions
about what a good object is, in OOP. Here is my four qualities
of a good object.

## It Exists In Real Life

An employee, a department, an HTTP request, a table in MySQL,
a line in a file, or a file itself are proper objects. Because they exist in
real-life even when our software doesn't work.

A controller, a parser, a service locator,
a singleton, or a factory are **not** good objects
(yes, most of GoF patterns are anti-patterns!).
They don't exist apart from your software, in real life.

## It Is Unique

A good object should always encapsulate something, in order
to be unique. If there is nothing to encapsulate, an object may
have identical clones, which, I believe, is bad. Here is an example
of a bad object, which may have clones:

{% highlight java %}
class Status {
  private URL page = new URL("http://www.google.com");
  public int read() throws IOException {
    return HttpURLConnection.class.cast(
      this.page.openConnection()
    ).getResponseCode();
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

Every instance of

Obviously, utility classes, which have only static methods,
can't instantiate good objects.

## It Is Immutable

A good object should never change its encapsulated state/knowledge
(see also [Objects Should Be Immutable]({% post_url 2014/jun/2014-06-09-objects-should-be-immutable %})).
It doesn't mean that its methods always return the same. Such a "dead end" object
would be of a very little use. Instead, a good object is very dynamic
but never changes its internal knowledge, for example:

{% highlight java %}
class Status {
  private URL page;
  public Status(URL url) {
    this.page = url;
  }
  public int read() throws IOException {
    return HttpURLConnection.class.cast(
      this.page.openConnection()
    ).getResponseCode();
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

Even though method `read()` may return different values, the
object is immutable. It points to a certain web page and will
never point anywhere else (will never change its encapsulated state).
Of course, a good object doesn't have
[setters]({% post_url 2014/sep/2014-09-16-getters-and-setters-are-evil %}).

## It Is Alive

An object must expose some functionality, through non-static methods.
Objects without methods are not good objects.
