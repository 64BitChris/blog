When you hire a software developer (individual or a team), there are
basically two types of contracts:
[fixed price](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed-price_contract) or
[time-and-material](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_and_materials).
They are fundamentally different but the truth is that in either case &mdash;
you lose.

In eXtremely Distributed Software Development
([XDSD](http://www.xdsd.org)) methodology everything is different, including
the way we invoice our clients.

The difference between fixed-cost and T&M is in who takes the risk of spending
money and getting nothing in return. This risk is huge in software
development industry, especially in outsourcing.
[Over 80%](http://www.projectsmart.co.uk/docs/chaos-report.pdf) of all
software projects fail to achieve their objectives, but very few programmers (if ever)
fail to get their monthly salaries. What does it tell us?
I guess, it means that in all failures you &mdash; the client &mdash; will be the loser.

In **"Time & Material"** you will simply pay and pray. If your programmers
appear to be honest workaholics you may get lucky and get something done.
As you see the numbers above, this is rarely the case. Don't fool yourself,
in your project they will be exactly the opposite. Even if you go for micro-management
and corporal punishment, your overall costs will be much higher than expected
and the quality will suffer.

This is how a monthly T&M invoice will look like. No matter how
good or bad was the code written during that month &mdash; you still have
to pay the bill. How many more invoices you will get until the
product is done? Nobody knows.

In **Fixed Price** you will feel secure at the beginning &mdash; "the statement
of work specifies everything and the price is fixed, how can I lose?"
According to the statistics above, programmers are much smarter than their
clients. You will lose in quality. Yes, you will get something for that
fixed price, but it will be a throw-away software. And when you decide to
modify it, new costs will bubble up. In the end, the whole project is ruined
and your money are turned into programmers' salaries. This model is even more
risky than T&M, where you at least have a chance.

So, what is the solution? Is it possible to have win-win
contracts with programmers?

Yes, it is.

We don't do fixed price because

Remember, in XDSD we work with a stream of micro-tasks, usually completed
in less than an hour. Each completed task immediately gets into your
billing statement
