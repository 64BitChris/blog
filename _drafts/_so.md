I've [said before]({% pst 2014/oct/2014-10-29-how-much-do-you-cost %})
that StackOverflow reputation is very important
for us, when we make a decision of how much we would pay
a software developer. There were many complaints about this metric,
for example here, here, and here. In a nutshell, so many of you
disagreed and said that the amount of up-votes at StackOverlow was
nothing more than an indicator of time someone spent on answering
some stupid questions of some junior programmers. Let me disagree and
explain why your activity at this platform is so important for your career.
