  your reputation will be high; if you don't use it,
  you're not a professional software engineer.

I've [said before]({% pst 2014/oct/2014-10-29-how-much-do-you-cost %})
that StackOverflow reputation is very important
for [us](http://www.teamed.io), when we make a decision of how much we would pay
a software developer. There were many complaints about this metric,
for example [here](http://www.yegor256.com/2014/10/29/how-much-do-you-cost.html#comment-1704113248)
and [here](http://www.yegor256.com/2014/10/29/how-much-do-you-cost.html#comment-1697910905).
In a nutshell, so many of you
disagreed and said that the amount of StackOverlow up-votes was
nothing more than a measurement of the amount of time someone spent on answering
some stupid questions of some clueless programmers. Let me disagree and
explain why your activity at this platform is so important for your career.

Basically, your StackOverflow profile demonstrates five skills you either
have or not. They may not be as important for an office <del>slave</del>
worker, but if you're going to work
[remotely]({% pst 2016/aug/2016-08-05-distributed-teams-are-higher-quality %}),
they are crucial.

**How to Search**.
StackExchange knowledge base is huge and contains answers to almost any
software question you may ask. You have to know how to search it
and not only via Google. You have to be familiar with the platform and
its key features, and you can't learn that without being an active user.
When your reputation is high it's a clear indicator for me, your potential
employer, that you're aware how to find the right information in this
knowledge base no.1.

**How to Ask**.
Asking a friend near by the coffee machine is one thing. Asking a community
of 6+ million developers is a totally different thing. You have to learn
how to explain your problem, how to formulate the question, how to label
it and title. Try it for the first time and you will see that it's not
easy at all: Your questions will sound immature, silly, ambiguous and will
end with "Best regards" (something you shouldn't do at SO). And, of course,
they will get zero up-votes. Later, when you improve, you will be surpised
to see that more and more of them get up-votes and your reputation
grows. This will be the indicator of your "question asking" skill growing up.
For me, your potential employer, it's a very important skill.

**How to Answer**.
Initially, you will be afraid to answer. Then, most of your answers will
be down-voted. Then, some of them will be accepted as best answers. Eventually,
some of them will start getting up-votes. Until that happen, you will go
through a lot of frustration and negative emotions. You will learn how to
make your answers helpful&mdash;not just to your friends, because they don't want
to offend you by saying that you have no idea what you're talking about, but
to strangers, who don't care about you personally, but only about the information
you're able to deliver. That's the skill you can't buy, you have to earn it.
And it's crucial in a distributed team.

**How to Deal with Morons**.
You know what to do with them in the office, but in the Internet they are
much more aggressive and offensive. And there are many of them. You need
to learn and practice a lot before you become competent enough to fetch
information out of that programming community without pulling your hair
out and screaming into the monitor. StackOverflow will help you a lot,
both through questions you will ask and answers you will try to give. And
you can't learn that in the office dealing with your friends.

**How to Deal with Smartasses**.
Some people there are very smart and knowledgeable and they will not always
be polite when you become too annoying with your questions or mistakes in
using the platform. Again, your office friends won't teach you how to
deal with that gurus so that you can fetch their knowledge, you have
to be actively involved in StackOverflow discussions. This skill is very
important for distributed programming, when you have to solve most of the
problems on your own.

To summarize, StackOverflow is a must have _instrument_ for any modern
software developer, no matter what your programming language is, your age,
your project or your professional level. It's like an IDE and unit tests&mdash;you
just use them in order to develop faster. Some people are still using
[vim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_%28text_editor%29) or
[emacs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emacs)
and write no tests, but you don't want to be like them.

StackOverflow is not just a web site, where you may have an account, if you feel
like it. It's a _mandatory_ instrument you have to use if you want me, your
potential employer, to value you as a serious engineer. And if you use
this instrument on a daily basis, your reputation will inevitably be high.

By the way, this is my [StackExchange profile](http://stackexchange.com/users/63162).
I've earned the majority of my reputation a few years ago, now I'm mostly getting up-votes
for the answers and questions I've posted earlier. However, I keep using
StackOverflow as I code, every day.
