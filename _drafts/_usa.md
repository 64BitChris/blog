Silicon Valley is a great place to be in. Or maybe not. I've spent five years there,
from 2011 till 2016. I did enjoy some parts of it, while other were not that enjoyable
at all. Here is a quick summary of what's wrong with this territory. I can't speak about
the rest of the United States, since I haven't seen many other places. I've
been in Seattle, New York, Los Angeles, Albuquerque, Washington, and probably a few other
cities I can't remember. They are better. Not much, but better. The territory
between San Francisco and San Jose, also known as Silicon Valley, is not
something you see in the TV Series. It is absolutely different. It is...

## It Is Distasteful

The way people dress up, the cars they buy, the way they decorate their
houses, the food they eat, the women they marry, the web sites they design---have
no taste, at all. And I'm not only speaking about ordinary middle class. I've
seen rich and poor, they all find Chinese take-away boxes
of something smelly pretty tasty and think that Chevrolet is a car.

While being richer than people I've met in, say, Amsterdam or Moscow, inhabitans
of the Valley don't know how to enjoy their money. And the longer you stay
there, the less eager you become to find beauty in life. You turn into a robot
focused on making money, to buy a one-million-dollar three-bedroom half-a-house,
which will smell cheap Indian food you will buy at the corner, because home cooking is not
cost-efficient.

Maybe this is how it should be, if a country wants its people to work, instead
of having fun and carelessly enjoying life. Americans do work. Don't get me wrong,
it's good. This is what I love in the Valley---it's very focused on results.
But the price it pays---the ugliness of everything around you---seems too high for me.

## It Is Insanely Correct ... Not

You have to expect them Social Justice Warriors everywhere:
amongst your co-workers, gym buddies, close friends, employers, and employees.
You have to be constantly on alert. You can't say "blacks" or "chicks," you have
to remember that they are afro-americans and ladies. You can't joke about
gays, immigrants, homeless, women, mexicans, and many other
"categories." Well, you can, but be prepared to get into trouble, which
you may never resolve.

What's funny is that <del>almost</del> every single white male I've met there was a racist, but
not publicly, of course. They all claimed to be tolerant but in a private
conversation were often whispering the n-word into my ear, while
speaking about the race problem. They always had a handful of racist jokes
when talking about their house keepers, who were all mexicans.

## It Is Unappetizing

Yes, unappetizing. Did I choose the right word? I'm talking about food.
I mentioned it already, but it deserves a special section. CNN
[thinks](https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/world-best-food-cultures/index.html)
that USA "cuisine" is the 10th best in the world, while Russian one is
not even in the list. You know, I remember when I was in one office in Mountain
View and we were going to have a lunch. Every day they were picking a different
cuisine, like Korean, Japanese, Italian, and so on. I asked them, why can't we
try American one for a change? They got surprised and Mike said: "We don't have one,"
and then added "Do you want hamburgers?"

As Ashley Lutz and Mallory Schlossberg perfectly noted in their
[ranked list](https://www.businessinsider.com/most-american-foods-of-all-time-2015-7)
of the best American dishes (check it out to get the idea of what they eat):
"When it comes to cuisine, America lives up to the adage 'bigger is better.'"
That's definitely true. Every dish you get in a restaurant will be big. Huge.
You know why? Not because they eat that much, but because they take what's left
home. In order to warm it up in the morning and have a free breakfast.

Aside from that, the way the food is served can't even nearly be compared
with what you can experience in Paris, Milan, Munich, or Moscow. I once
saw a road ad saying something like "Food! $5.00 per pound!" Was it a joke?
I don't know, and I don't think so.
