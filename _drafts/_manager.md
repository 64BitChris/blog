How to be a good manager?
It's not so difficult:
lead, mentor and coach;
harness energy and drive action;
never settle for mediocrity;
champion excellence;
foster sequential and consequential learning;
do with, not for;
recognise and reward;
listen;
engage;
embrace.
If this simple recipe doesn't work, there is something wrong with you.
To help you out, I will try to break it down to pieces.
