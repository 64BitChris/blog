There are four phases in every project my team is working with:

 1. Thinking

 2. Building

 3. Coding

 4. Using

The first phase is about thinking. The result is a baselined
specification.

The result of the second phase is a minimum value product (MVP)
or a proof of concept (PoC) or a prototype or a skeleton. There
are many names.

The third phase is all about adding a meat to the skeleton.

The fourth one is about helping users to use it.
