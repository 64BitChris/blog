There are four phases in every project [Teamed.io](http://www.teamed.io)
is working with:

 * **Thinking**.
   We're trying to understand what is the problem that the product
   is going to solve. We're also investigating its boundaries &mdash;
   who will work with the software (actors) and how (user stories).
   Deliverables: specification.
   Duration: from 2 days up to 3 weeks.
   Participants: product owner, analyst(s), architect, project manager.

 * **Building**.
   The software architect is creating a [proof-of-concept](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_concept)
   (aka [MVP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product) or prototype or a skeleton).
   It is a one-man job that is done almost without any interaction
   with anyone. The architect builds the product according to the
   specification in a very limited time frame. The result will have
   multiple bugs and open ends, but it will implement the main user story.
   The architect also configures continuous integration and delivery pipelines.
   Deliverables: working software.
   Duration: 2-5 days.
   Participants: architect.

 * **Fixing**.
   At this phase we are adding all the meat to the skeleton. The phase
   takes most of the time and budget and involves many participants.
   In some projects we're inviting up to 50 people at the same time.
   Since we treat all incosistencies as bugs, the phase is mostly about
   finding, reporting and fixing bugs, in order to stabilize the product
   and make it ready for the market launch. We are incrementing and
   releasing the software multiple times a day, preferably to its user
   champions.
   Deliverables: bug fixes via pull requests.
   Duration: from weeks to months.
   Participants: programmer(s), designer(s), tester(s), code reviewer(s), architect, project manager.

 * **Using**.
   At this final phase we launch the product to its end-users
   and
