There is a great book called
[Software Requirements](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00JDMPMOA/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00JDMPMOA&linkCode=as2&tag=yegor256com-20&linkId=PRSWJK34HNP355LK)
written by Karl Wiegers, about, well, software requirements.
It's a must read for every software engineer, I believe. No
need to repeat what it says, but there are a few very
simple and very typical mistakes we keep making in our
specs. I keep seeing them in our documents again and again,
that's why decided to summaries. Twelve most critical and typical of them.
