In the [How Much Do You Cost?]({% pst 2014/oct/2014-10-29-how-much-do-you-cost %})
post, last year, I said that open source contribution is a very
important factor in defining who is good and who is bad. I mean programmers.
I was saying that if you're not contributing to open source, if your
GitHub profile is not full of projects and commits, your "value", as a
software developer, is low. Simply because this lack of open source
activity tells everybody that you're not passionate about software
development and are simply working for money. I keep getting angry comments,
every week. Let me answer them all here.

The gist of all that comments is this: "I don't contribute to open source,
but I'm still very passionate about software development". Then, there is
a list of reasons why the author of the comment doesn't contribute:

  * I spend my free time with my family
  * I'm already busy in the office, why doing any extra work?
  * I'm well paid, why doing anything for free?
  * My employer doesn't allow me to contribute to open source
  * My company won't pay me for writing open source code

Good excuses, but let's try to look at it with

Today, it's not possible at all to create any software without using
open source components. I'm sure, nobody will argue with this. Only something
very basic and simple can be created without code reuse. Nah, I'm wrong. Even
super small pieces of software can't be created without open source
"neighbours". At least, you need an operating system and a programming language.
In most cases, they are open source (Microsoft is an exception and it must die).

Thus, no matter what software you're creating, you're using modules,
created for you by others. Someone else spent his or her time, to help you.

Now, you're not giving anything back. I'm curious, why is that?

There are could be two reasons. The first one is that you just don't care.
They give you something and you're not giving anything back. You simply
don't feel like being a player on this market. You take their libraries,
re-use them in your product, collect a paycheck and go home. You don't care
what will happen with the industry, with that programmers, with the language
you're writing in, with the platform, etc. You don't want to improve the
libraries, you don't want to create and share new ones, you don't want to
report bugs and feature requests, you don't want to send patches and pull
requests to them.

I do understand that. Millions of programmers are like that, you're not alone.
But, please, don't tell me that you're passionate about software development.
Just admit that you don't care. It's not a crime, after all. You're not stealing
anything... (although, I actually think that you are, but that's a different story)

That was the first reason why you may not contribute.
However, in most cases, my typical opponent is telling me that he or she does care,
but just can't. There are obstacles, right? Your family is taking
all your free time and in the office you simply are not allowed to
work on something that is outside of business scope. I can imagine that,
but let's see what's happening behind the scene.

You're telling me that your company doesn't care about software industry,
right? They don't allow you to give anything back to the open source community.
They want you to use that free libraries and give nothing back. And it is their
corporate strategy. I doubt that it's the case though.
Did you ask your CTO about it?

I strongly believe that in 95% cases, when you explain that your software
seriously depends on a few open source libraries, which may need some
improvements, your boss will have nothing against you becoming a contributor.
Try it.

Sometimes, the boss will say that he/she doesn't care about any open source
and wants you to focus on your product. Maybe this will happen rather often,
I don't know.

In that case, my next question is philosophical. You're working for such a person and
such a company. You're accepting their paychecks. Aren't you a part
of this team and this mentality? If you don't walk away, you accept this
attitude. You're part of it. It's you, who don't care. Not just them.
Because of your existence they have an ability to not care.

If tomorrow they will ask you to use stolen software, you may say
that you had no choice: "My boss asked me to do this. I did care about
copyright and strongly believed that software authors must be paid. But
I had to steal, because that's what my company was asking me to do".
Does it sound like a good excuse?

The same story with open source. If you do care and you're passionate
about software development &mdash; you will either contribute actively,
or walk away from the company that doesn't share your passion. You can't
walk away because of some reasons? Than don't tell me about your passion.
Simply admit that you're too weak to follow your passion.

Again, it's not a crime. It's just who you are.
