Revenue means **cash** that is coming to your bank account every month,
from your customers. Not investors. Customers. Those who are buying
your products or your service. You are doing everything you can
to make sure this number grows. Mostly because you use this money
to pay your rent, buy food and settle that graphic designer's invoices.
Without revenue your business will die, right? Yes, maybe. But, in my experience,
a growing revenue may kill you even faster than its absence.

I see this rather typical pattern in many startups we're interviewing
in [SeedRamp](http://www.seedramp.com). The idea is great, the prototype
works, first customers are on board, first payments are coming in,
founders are excited. They spend all their energy to make sure that
customers are happy by making new features, fixing bugs and employing
new customer retention tools. They are also trying to acquire new
customers, paying for marketing, promotion and AdWords. The numbers
are growing every month and ... they don't realize that they are
actually **killing** their own startup.

There is a big difference between a
[lifestyle business](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifestyle_business)
and a [startup company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startup_company).
You create a lifestyle business in order to generate revenue and become
rich by taking part of its
[profit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profit_%28accounting%29) as
[dividends](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dividend).
A good example of a lifestyle business is a
cafe, a bakery, a law firm, a body shop, or a web development studio.
Your goal in a lifestyle business is to **make money**, for yourself. Your
goal is the profit, as part of the revenue.
On the first day and in five years. You could be making
$500 a month or $100 million a year, as a founder of that business &mdash;
it is still a lifestyle business.

A startup company is a different story.

Your customers and your revenue is not the goal in a startup, but just
an **instrument** that helps you achieve your real goal &mdash;
[valuation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_valuation). You are
supposed to use your revenue and customer base to convince investors
that the prototype works and your valuation is already high enough. Moreover,
a steadily growing revenue must be used as a primitive demonstration of a future
[customer acquisition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_acquisition_management)
model. But it is not the result by itself. It is just an instrument,
a mean, a tool.

When you focus on your revenue, you're turning your startup into
a lifestyle business.
