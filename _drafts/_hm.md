You know, I'm well aware of the recent hysteria around
[sexual harrassment](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/30/technology/women-entrepreneurs-speak-out-sexual-harassment.html)
and fully understand what consequences this blog post may cause:
the incoming [stream of hate](/testimonials.html) will increase. So be it,
I still need to say what I have to say. I recently discovered that
I'm a [sexist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexism),
a [misogynist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misogyny), and
a [male chauvinist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chauvinism#Male_chauvinism).
To discover that I [shared](https://twitter.com/restless_amg/status/881176174650687488)
some thoughts about "women in tech" in my
[Telegram group](https://t.me/joinchat/AAAAAEJFMRzsRTRxM3ec6A)
and immediately got all that titles. Now I'm concerned&mdash;am I that bad
and must be isolated? Let me share my beliefs with you and hear your opinions.

I believe that men and women are different: physically, intellectually, and emotionally.
<del>God</del> The Nature designed us to do different things in our lives.
If we want to be happy we must celebrate our differences,
they are making us attractive to each other,
sometimes they trigger _love_.

I believe that logic is the masculine skill of a human brain, while
emotion is the feminine one. In other words, men are designed to think and
women are designed to feel. Of course, every person has a combination of both,
but men are more logical, while women are more emotional, by design.

I believe that [gender equality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_equality),
as a social movement, is damaging us. Giving us too much rights
is like making heroin legal: smart people will use it wisely, while
others will abuse it. For example, I would make heavy athletics for women
and facial makeup for men illegal. We are not made equal, we have
differences, and I enjoy seeing that differences.

I believe that writing code (aka "programming") is the job where logical
skills are much more important than feelings. Thus, if a woman
wants to celebrate her feminine skills and stay attractive to men,
she better stay away from jobs that require strictly logical thinking.
There are many other jobs in tech, where feelings will win, for example
product/project management, graphic design, customer/investor relationship,
sales, marketing.

I believe that homosexuality is a
[personality disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personality_disorder)
similar to [sociopathy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychopathy#Sociopathy).
If a male doesn't feel sexual desire towards females, it's only sad.
The opposite is also true. I believe that in most cases this is the result
of gender equality being abused by the society.

I believe that asking a woman out if I find her sexually attractive
has nothing to do with harrassment, no matter who is that woman&mdash;a client, a job
candidate, an investor, or a waitress. I also believe that seeing a woman as
a [sexual object](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_objectification)
first and a person second is only natural when the relationship
between the two just starts.

I believe that sexual instinct is the primary driving motivator of our behavior,
no matter who we are&mdash;programmers, venture capitalists, graphic
designers, taxi drivers, or plumbers.
Recent [feministic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feminism)
attempts to suppress that basic instinct will inevitably lead to serious social
troubles in the future.

I believe in love.

Am I a sexist, a mysogynist and a male chauvinist?
Is there something wrong with me, Doc?
