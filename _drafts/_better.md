OK, it's time to publish this piece. I've been dancing around for quite a while,
telling you how to make [more per hour]({% pst 2014/oct/2014-10-29-how-much-do-you-cost %}),
how to manage those [stupid managers]({% pst 2017/aug/2017-08-01-how-to-manage-a-manager %}) that don't let you grow,
how to [boost your career]({% pst 2017/jan/2017-01-24-career-advice %}),
how to deal with [office slavery]({% pst 2015/oct/2015-10-06-how-to-be-good-office-slave %}).
Here is a plain simple list of recommendations for you: what do you do
if you want to be a more successful programmers. Not a better algorithm
designer, even though it's important. Not a funnier <del>clown</del>
[team player]({% pst 2018/aug/2018-08-29-soft-skills %}), even though it's
also important. But a more successful software engineer, both financially
and socially.

There is no particular order, just everything I have in mind, in one list.

**Make Your Own Product**.
Learning how to program and programming are not same things. The best,
and the only right way to learn is "by doing." The best way of doing is
creating something meaningful and important. If it's your own product---even
better. If someone pays you for that---best.

...

**Change Languages**.

**Go Full Cycle**.

**Open Sources**.
Like I said in my talk [_How Bright Is Your Future?_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGbteQpTNCA)
at RigaDevDays, the future of software will almost entirely be open source. The
amount of code companies keep in house is decreasing every year. You have
to be an open source advocate, if you want to be successful. If you are still
[afraid]({% pst 2015/dec/2015-12-22-why-dont-you-contribute-to-open-source %}),
or don't have time, [reconsider]({% pst 2017/may/2017-05-30-why-contribute-to-open-source %}).
Writing code for yourself and your office buddies, and writing it for a few
thousand anonymous GitHub hooligans---are two different stories. You will
need time to get up to speed in this wild territory. Took me three years.
Don't wait, start now.

**Unit Test**.
Almost everything I learned about

**Statically Analyze**.

**Ask at Stackoverflow**.

**Earn Certificates**.

**Go to Job Interviews**.

**Change Jobs**.

**Change Places**.

**Read Books**.

**Follow Key People**.

**Lurke**.

**Attend Conferences**.
