OK, it's time to publish this piece. I've been dancing around for quite a while,
telling you how to make [more per hour]({% pst 2014/oct/2014-10-29-how-much-do-you-cost %}),
how to manage those [stupid managers]({% pst 2017/aug/2017-08-01-how-to-manage-a-manager %}) that don't let you grow,
how to [boost your career]({% pst 2017/jan/2017-01-24-career-advice %}),
how to deal with [office slavery]({% pst 2015/oct/2015-10-06-how-to-be-good-office-slave %}).
Here is a plain simple list of recommendations for you: what do you do
if you want to be a more successful programmers. Not a better algorithm
designer, even though it's important. Not a funnier <del>clown</del>
[team player]({% pst 2018/aug/2018-08-29-soft-skills %}), even though it's
also important. But a more successful software engineer, both financially
and socially.

There is no particular order, just everything I have in mind, in one list.

**Make Your Own Product**.
Learning how to program and programming are not same things. The best,
and the only right way to learn is "by doing." The best way of doing is
creating something meaningful and important. If it's your own product---even
better. If someone pays you for that---best.

...

**Change Languages**.

**Go Full Cycle**.
Writing code that "works on your laptop" is a great achievement ... of a junior
programmer. A senior one knows that it's only a part of the job. A smaller one.
The bigger part is turning your "working" code into a market-ready product,
which means merging and auto-testing, compiling and packaging for multiple platforms,
staging and acceptance testing, bug reporting, metrics collecting, A/B testing,
stress and load testing, deploying to production, and even reporting to investors.
Modern software development lifecycle is a giant mess. Do you know how it all works?
You don't? You don't care? You are not a senior developer.

**Open Your Sources**.
Like I said in my talk [_How Bright Is Your Future?_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGbteQpTNCA)
at RigaDevDays, the future of software will almost entirely be open source. The
amount of code companies keep in house is decreasing every year. You have
to be an open source advocate, if you want to be successful. If you are still
[afraid]({% pst 2015/dec/2015-12-22-why-dont-you-contribute-to-open-source %}),
or don't have time, [reconsider]({% pst 2017/may/2017-05-30-why-contribute-to-open-source %}).
Writing code for yourself and your office buddies, and writing it for a few
thousand anonymous GitHub hooligans---are two different stories. You will
need time to get up to speed in this wild territory. Took me three years.
Don't wait, start now.

**Test Everything**.
To be honest, almost everything I've learned about software quality, I owe
to the painful hours of writing unit tests, mocks, fixtures, stubs, integration
tests, and so on. I truly believe that a professional programmer spends more
time for creating automated tests than for writing production code. That's why
I'd recommend you to focus on testing, if you want to become a better engineer.
Start with the great book [_Growing Object-Oriented Software, Guided by Tests_](http://amzn.to/1PBpoDT)
by Steve Freeman and Nat Pryce and make yourself [a rule]({% pst 2017/mar/2017-03-24-tdd-that-works %}):
every line of code, you are in doubt about, must be proven by a test.

**Statically Analyze**.
Well, half of my knowledge about software quality I owe to unit testing. The
other half---to static analyizers. I learned much more from Checkstyle and PMD
than from all Java books I've ever read. Every new programming language I learn
I start with configuring the strictest static analyzer I can find and listening
to its complains. I'd recommend you do the same. Listen to your tools and make
sure your code is 100% complaint with their quality expectations. Don't just
use them as recommendation providers, but make yourself a rule: never commit
anything that doesn't fully pass all static analyzers.

**Humiliate Yourself at StackOverflow**.
You know they say that in order to ask the right question you have to know
almost the entire answer. Friends, online chats, and office kitchen talks are
great places to find help ... for junior programmers. Those people understand you
no matter how stupid your questions are and this is how they spoil you. You don't
grow while talking to them and getting their help. You degrade. Instead, you should
ask where nobody knows you and will only answer if your question is perfectly
formulated and expressed. There are many places, but StackOverflow is the best.
Make sure every question you have goes to StackOverflow first. Then you may share the
link with your buddies. But StackOverflow comes first.

**Earn Certificates**.
I've got some of them and I'm planning to get more, even though I'm not really
a programmer [on a payroll]({% pst 2015/jul/2015-07-21-hourly-pay-modern-slavery %})
and I'm not going to be employed by any enterprise that
cares about badges in
[my CV](https://latexonline.cc/compile?git=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fyegor256%2Fblog&target=_latex%2Fresume-boring.tex&command=pdflatex&trackId=1520166474432).
Still, I want more certificates. Why? Because I learn a lot when I pass them.
And when I fail (I did, twice, up to now). There are two things certificates
give you: 1) they help you fill up your knowledge gaps, and 2) they boost your
self-respect (when and if you pass, of course). Make yourself a rule: one
new certificate every year.

**Go to Job Interviews**.
“Changing jobs every couple of years used to look bad on a resume. It told
recruiters you can't hold down a job, can't get along with colleagues, or
that you're simply disloyal and can’t commit. That stigma is fast
becoming antiquated. Workers who stay with a company longer than
two years are said to get paid 50% less,” according to
[Vivian Giang](https://www.fastcompany.com/3055035/you-should-plan-on-switching-jobs-every-three-years-for-the-rest-of-your-).
The bottom line is that you must be ready to change the job, because you will, soon.
If you won't, you will lose. Regular job interviews is the best way to prepare
yourself. Make it a rule: every three months you go to an interview.

**Change Jobs**.

**Change Places**.

**Read Books**.

**Follow Key People**.
I mean Twitter (I'm [@yegor256](https://twitter.com/yegor256)),
Facebook ([here](https://www.facebook.com/yegor256) I am),
Telegram ([my channel](https://t.me/yegor256news)),
Instagram ([click here](https://instagram.com/yegor256) to follow me), and, of course,
GitHub (I'm [@yegor256](https://github.com/yegor256)). What's new you can hear from me?
Maybe not so much, probably, but you will get a feeling of what's goin on
in my life, where I'm heading, what I read, what I write, etc. Who do I follow?
All authors of all books I like, all bloggers I ever enjoyed reading,

**Lurke**.

**Attend Conferences**.
