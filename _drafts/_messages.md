[Alan Kay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Kay) is the father of OOP.
He was the designer of [Smalltalk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smalltalk),
the first object-oriented language.
Later, however, in 1998
[he said](http://lists.squeakfoundation.org/pipermail/squeak-dev/1998-October/017019.html)
that the very term "object" was misleading and a more appropriate one
would be "messaging."
What do I think about that? I think he was wrong.
