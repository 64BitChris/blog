Ever heard about "panic driven development"?
[Google it](https://www.google.com/search?q=panic+driven+development).
I don't know your situation, but I'm getting this from every second client.
"We need this now, pick up the phone!" is a replacement of a business plan.
Sudden phone calls, emails to all available addresses
at the same time, "ASAP", "immediately", and "now"&mdash;are the
most popular management instruments. What do you do in such situations?
How do you manage that type of clients? I'm still trying to find the
right solution. The next few paragraphs are mostly addressed to my current
and future clients.

First of all, I totally understand why you, my dear client, are doing this. I understand
that you are in a very tough spot. You need something done. And we're lazy,
chaotic, expensive and... smarter than you. Admit it, way smarter.
We're developing software for years, seeing clients after clients, robbing
them, and watching how they suffer.

You guys hire us without analyzing the contract. You

contracts
no management - just controllers
a lot of trust
no static quality
no tech reviews
no unit testing
9-to-5 work format
no metrics
no devops best practices
no rewards/punishment
you hide real concerns
you don't allow us to talk freely

So, what else can I say? Calm down and try to enjoy it.
