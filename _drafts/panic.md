Ever heard about "panic driven development"?
[Google it](https://www.google.com/search?q=panic+driven+development).
I don't know your situation, but I'm getting this from every second client.
"We need this now, pick up the phone!" is a replacement of a plan.
Sudden phone calls, emails to all available addresses
at the same time, "ASAP", "immediately", and "now"&mdash;are the
most popular management instruments. What do you do in such situations?
How do you manage that type of clients? I'm still trying to find the
right solution. The next few paragraphs are mostly addressed to my current
and future clients.

First of all, I totally understand why you, my dear client, are doing this. I understand
that you are on a very tough spot: you need something done. And we're lazy,
chaotic, expensive and... _smarter than you_.

Admit it, way smarter. We're developing software for years, seeing
clients after clients, robbing them, and watching how they suffer. You're
not the first, not the last. The demand for programmers in the world now
is two times higher than the industry can supply. We're in a very comfortable
position. We control the situation, we're in charge. Not you, even though
you're paying and thinking that you are the customer.

**You trust us?** Thanks for that!
We'll use it against you when things go south.
The contract says you pay by the time! Thus, no matter how bad
is the product code, how much time we wasted, how many promises we broke,
you still pay us&mdash;full price. You don't like it? Try to get away.
You will lose everything you already invested, since our code is almost
unmaintainable and you will have to start from scratch.

**You don't know what TDD is?** Thanks for that!
Maybe we will write tests

**You want us to work in the office?**
Thanks! This "being in the office" activity is so much easier
for us than "achieving" any results. We will sit in the office you're
paying for, scrolling Facebook and doing our own things and side projects.
You want us to be in the office? We are in the office.

**You pay us monthly?**
Thanks to that, our primary motivation is to stay with you till
the end of the month. We don't care about your business goals, your
problems, your strategy. You're just a cash cow for us. That's why
you have to yell, cry, and scream to get something done. Behind your back
we laugh at you.

You think you're the boss and we're coders?

You don't want to offend us with external reviews?

You believe in people, not metrics?

You don't really know what continous delivery is?

no management - just controllers
no static quality
no tech reviews
you hide real concerns
you don't allow us to talk freely

So, what else can I say? Don't panic, dear client, calm down. You're in
good hands. We'll suck you dry and maybe you will get something done. If
you are super lucky and we're in good mood.
