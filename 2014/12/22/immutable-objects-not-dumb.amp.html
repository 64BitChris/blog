      <h1>Immutable Objects Are Not Dumb</h1>
      <p>After a few recent posts about immutability, including
<a href="/2014/06/09/objects-should-be-immutable.html">&quot;Objects Should Be Immutable&quot;</a> and
<a href="/2014/12/09/immutable-object-state-and-behavior.html">&quot;How an Immutable Object Can Have State and Behavior?&quot;</a>,
I was surprised by the number of comments saying that I badly misunderstood
the idea. Most of those comments stated that an immutable object must always behave
the same way &mdash; that is what immutability is about. What kind of immutability
is it, if a method returns different results each time we call it?
This is not how well-known immutable classes behave. Take, for example, <code>String</code>, <code>BigInteger</code>,
<code>Locale</code>, <code>URI</code>, <code>URL</code>, <code>Inet4Address</code>, <code>UUID</code>, or wrapper classes for primitives, like <code>Double</code> and
<code>Integer</code>. Other comments argued against
<a href="/2014/11/20/seven-virtues-of-good-object.html">the very definition</a>
of an immutable object as a representative of a mutable real-world entity. How
could an immutable object represent a mutable entity? Huh?</p>

<p>I&#39;m very surprised. This post is going to clarify the definition of an immutable
object. First, here is a quick answer. How can an immutable object represent a mutable entity?
Look at an immutable class,
<a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/io/File.html"><code>File</code></a>,
and its methods, for example <code>length()</code> and <code>delete()</code>. The class is immutable, according
to Oracle documentation, and its methods may return different values each time
we call them. An object of class <code>File</code>, being perfectly immutable,
represents a mutable real-world entity, a file on disk.</p>

<p>In <a href="/2014/06/09/objects-should-be-immutable.html">this post</a>, I said
that &quot;an object is immutable if its state can&#39;t be modified after it is created.&quot;
This definition is not mine; it&#39;s taken from
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321349601/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0321349601&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=yegor256com-20&amp;linkId=PHMGYYT46MJV2JLO">Java Concurrency in Practice by Goetz et al.</a>, Section 3.4
(by the way, I highly recommend you read it). Now look at this class
(I&#39;m using <a href="http://http.jcabi.com">jcabi-http</a> to read and write over HTTP):</p>

<p>What is the &quot;state&quot; in this class? That&#39;s right, <code>this.uri</code> is the state. It
uniquely identifies every object of this class, and it is not modifiable. Thus,
the class makes only immutable objects. And each object represents a
mutable entity of the real world, a web page with a URI.</p>

<p>There is no contradiction in this situation. The class is perfectly immutable,
while the web page it represents is mutable.</p>

<p>Why do most programmers I have talked to believe that
if an underlying entity is mutable, an object is mutable too? I think the
answer is simple &mdash; they think that objects are
data structures with methods. That&#39;s why, from this point of view,
an immutable object is a data structure that never changes.</p>

<p>This is where the fallacy is coming from &mdash; an object is
<strong>not a data structure</strong>. It is a living organism representing
a real-world entity inside the object&#39;s living environment (a computer program).
It does encapsulate some data, which helps to locate the entity in the real world. The encapsulated
data is the <strong>coordinates</strong> of the entity being represented. In the case
of <code>String</code> or <code>URL</code>, the coordinates are the same as the
entity itself, but this is just an isolated incident, not a generic rule.</p>

<p>An immutable object is not a data structure that doesn&#39;t change, even
though <code>String</code>, <code>BigInteger</code>, and <code>URL</code> look like one. An object is immutable
if and only if it doesn&#39;t change the coordinates of the real-world entity
it represents. In the <code>Page</code> class above, this means that an object of
the class, once instantiated, will never change <code>this.uri</code>. It will
always point to the same web page, no matter what.</p>

<p>And the object doesn&#39;t guarantee anything about the behavior of that web page. The page
is a dynamic creature of a real world, living its own life. Our object
can&#39;t promise anything about the page. The only thing it promises is that
it will always stay loyal to that page &mdash; it will never forget or change
its coordinates.</p>

<p>Conceptually speaking, immutability means loyalty, that&#39;s all.</p>
