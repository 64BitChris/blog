      <h1>Avoid String Concatenation</h1>
      <p>This is "string concatenation", and it is a bad practice:</p>



<p>Why? Some may say that it is slow, mostly because parts of
the resulting string are copied multiple times. Indeed, on every <code>+</code> operator,
<code>String</code> class allocates a new block in memory and copies everything
it has into it; plus a suffix being concatenated. This is true,
but this is not the point here.</p>



<p>Actually, I don't think performance in this case is a big issue.
Moreover, there were <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/925423">multiple experiments</a>
showing that concatenation is not that slow when compared to other
string building methods and sometimes is even faster.</p>

<p>Some say that concatenated strings are not localizable because in
different languages text blocks in a phrase may be positioned
in a different order. The example above can't be translated to,
say, Russian, where we would want to put a name in front of
"привет." We will need to localize the entire block of code,
instead of just translating a phrase.</p>

<p>However, my point here is different. I strongly recommend
avoiding string concatenation because it is <strong>less readable</strong>
than other methods of joining texts together.</p>

<p>Let's see these alternative methods. I'd recommend three of them (in order of preference):
<code>String.format()</code>,
Apache <code>StringUtils</code> and
Guava <code>Joiner</code>.</p>

<p>There is also a <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/StringBuilder.html"><code>StringBuilder</code></a>,
but I don't find it as attractive as <code>StringUtils</code>. It is a useful
builder of strings, but not a proper replacer or string
concatenation tool when readability is important.</p>

<h2 id="string-format">String.format()</h2>

<p><a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/String.html#format%28java.lang.String,%20java.lang.Object...%29"><code>String.format()</code></a>
is my favorite option. It makes text phrases easy to understand
and modify. It is a static utility method that mirrors
<a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstdio/sprintf/"><code>sprintf()</code></a> from C.
It allows you to build a string using a pattern and substitutors:</p>



<p>When the text is longer, the advantages of the formatter become
much more obvious. Look at this ugly code:</p>



<p>This one looks much more beautiful doesn't it:</p>



<p>Please note that I'm using argument indexes in order to make
the pattern even more localizable. Let's say, I want
to translate it to Greek. This is how will it look:</p>



<p>I'm changing the order of substitutions in the pattern,
but not in the actual list of methods arguments.</p>

<h2 id="apache-stringutils-join">Apache <code>StringUtils.join()</code>
</h2>

<p>When the text is rather long (longer than your screen width),
I would recommend that you use the utility class
<a href="http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-lang/javadocs/api-2.6/org/apache/commons/lang/StringUtils.html"><code>StringUtils</code></a>
from Apache <a href="http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-lang/">commons-lang3</a>:</p>



<p>The need to include an additional JAR dependency
to your classpath may be considered a downside with this method
(get its latest versions in <a href="http://search.maven.org/">Maven Central</a>):</p>



<h2 id="guava-joiner">Guava Joiner</h2>

<p>Similar functionality is provided by
<a href="http://google.github.io/guava/releases/16.0/api/docs/com/google/common/base/Joiner.html"><code>Joiner</code></a>
from Google <a href="https://code.google.com/p/guava-libraries/">Guava</a>:</p>



<p>It is a bit less convenient than <code>StringUtils</code> since you always
have to provide a joiner (character or a string placed between text blocks).</p>

<p>Again, a dependency is required in this case:</p>



<p>Yes, in most cases, all of these methods work slower than
a plain simple concatenation. However, I strongly believe
that <strong>computers are cheaper than people</strong>. What I mean is that
the time spent by programmers understanding and modifying ugly
code is much more expensive than a cost of an additional server
that will make beautifully written code work faster.</p>
