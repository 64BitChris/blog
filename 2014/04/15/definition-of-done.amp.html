      <h1>Definition Of Done</h1>
      

<p><a href="https://www.scrum.org/Resources/Scrum-Glossary/Definition-of-Done">Definition of Done (DoD)</a> is a
key definition used in Scrum and the one we also use in <a href="http://www.xdsd.org">XDSD</a>.</p>

<p>DoD is an exit criteria of a simple atomic task and answers the question:"am I
done with this task?" Moreover, DoD answers the question: "will I be paid for
the task?"</p>

<p>In <a href="http://www.xdsd.org">XDSD</a>, the definition of "done" is very simple — the task is done
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_and_only_if">iff</a>
its author accepts the deliverables.</p>



<p>At <a href="http://www.xdsd.org">XDSD</a>, our first and most important principle states that someone is paid only
when he provides deliverables. Combining the definition of done and the
principle of paying only for deliverables provides us a very important
conclusion: we do not pay for un-finished tasks.</p>

<p>Every task has its own time budget. Regardless of the number of people who
worked on a task previously, only the last one — the one who managed to provide
a working deliverable — receives payment.</p>

<p>To better understand this principle, you should read:
<a href="/2014/04/13/no-obligations-principle.html">No Obligations Principle</a>.</p>

<p>Your goal as a developer working on a task should be to close it and receive
payment as soon as possible. To that end, here are few things that can help you
complete tasks and receive payments without too much frustration:</p>

<ul>
<li>Don't even start a task unless you're sure you can finish it;</li>
<li>Ask any and all questions of the task author in advance (before beginning work);</li>
<li>Don't assume anything — ask if you're not sure;</li>
<li>Stay after the author to close tasks — be aggressive, no matter who is he/she;</li>
<li>Don't expect any help from anyone — you're on your own;</li>
<li>Ask PM about payment if you don’t receive it automatically after an author closes your task(s)</li>
</ul>

<p>It is important to remember that, as a developer, it is your responsibility to
ensure that tasks are closed and you receive payment.</p>
