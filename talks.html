Below is a list of all venues I&#39;ve been talking at with my short
summary of their quality. Well, not just a summary, but an evaluation.
Not every conference is as good as some others. That&#39;s why I decided to
give them some feedback, at least here (see below).</p>

It was a surprisingly well organized one-day event with over 300 attendees,
two tracks, and inexpensive entry ticket ($75). Even though their budget
was rather low they paid for travel and hotel and invited speakers mostly
from abroad. The audience was well prepared for my talk, I&#39;ve got many questions
right after the presenation and during the rest of the day. However, the
venue was not really comfortable and the content was mostly outdated.</p>

Almost everything was done perfectly at this event. There were over 500 attendees
and just two tracks (when I was speaking). The venue was very comfortable,
modern and located in a walking distance from the center. All the logistics
were done perfectly, the food was of high quality, the team was personally
there and in permanent contact with speakers. It&#39;s asolutely a must to be there
again.</p>

It was a very big event with, I guess, about 1500 visitors and nine (!) tracks.
What was good is that they paid for all travel expenses and the venue was
really modern. Aside from that, everything else was not so good. There was
no focus in content, the audience wasn&#39;t prepared at all, there were many
sponsor boothes, but a total lack of attention to the content. Besides that,
I haven&#39;t even met organizers.</p>

There were about 400 people, 2-3 tracks and a terrible venue. Seriously,
the place was a total disaster, even though it&#39;s a newly built conference
center. The sound, the location of rooms, the after-talk areas &mdash; everything
was uncomfortable. Also, the content was not really well selected. They invited
a few star speakers just because of their names, which usually is a mistake.
The after-party was good though. It seemed that organizers tried to do this event
with love, but the venue and speakers, unfortunately, didn&#39;t play along.</p>

There were over 400 people, two days, and four tracks. The venue, the food,
the transportation were rather good, taking into account ticket price. Besides
that, the audience was very motivated and engaged. The only downside was a very
short time slot for each talk (30 minutes), very short breaks (10 minutes) and
the amount of speakers. It felt too crowded. Asided from that, I would definitely
try to visit it again.</p>

The organization was very good. Not perfect, but very good. There were about
300 people and four tracks (I think it&#39;s too many). The only problem was
with the content. It looked like they paid too much attention to logistics
and forgot about content. Aside from that, definitely a place to see again.</p>

The venue, the logistics, the food, the organization, the size (over 1000 people),
and the preliminary screening of my presentation... everything was very good. What I didn&#39;t like
is the amount of tracks (too many) and the list of speakers, which, I believe,
almost copied JPoint. Would be great to see new faces. Overall impression was
very positive, definitely will try to attend it next year.</p>

Surprisingly, the conference was very good. Just two tracks for about 400
attendees, motivated audience, good equipment, video recording, etc. What I
obviously didn&#39;t like was the venue (not really comfortable), the mess with
the schedule (my talk was delayed for over 30 minutes), and an absense
of focus on some specific subject. Aside from that, it was a positive experience.</p>

It was a rather small conference (around 150 people) without any specific
focus. The venue (Radisson) was perfect, but the amount of tracks too big. There
were less than 30 people in my room. Also, the organization was rather messy
and my talk was delayed for over 20 minutes.</p>

Even though it&#39;s a big (over 1000 people) and popular European conference about Java, my
overall impression is not really positive. The venue was not
comfortable at all (it was a cinema), there were no tables for food and we
were eating lunch in cinema chairs :) The amount of talks and tracks was
too big, the audience was very disfocused. What seriously affected my
impression is the way listeners were leaving the rooms during the talks,
check this <a href="https://twitter.com/yegor256/status/731113702691352576">tweet</a>.
Besides that, the organization was rather formal and messy. There is a lot
of room for improvement.</p>

The conference was rather small (around 150 people), but well organized. What
I didn&#39;t really like was the food and the venue (we even had some other
conference going in the next room to us). Also, the audience was not really
engaged and prepared, as it seemed to me. I believe, this event may improve
and become better, the potential is definitely there.</p>

It was an interesting event, mostly because the audience was full
of questions and really interested in project management. The location, the
food, logistics, etc. were good enough. I didn&#39;t really like the content
other speakers were delivering. I suspect that most of them were invited
there because of their names.</p>

There were about 250 people. The location was not good at all &mdash;
it was a cinema. Also, the audience was so serious or so shy that it
was rather difficult to present. Not just for me. Also, I got an impression
that speakers were invited just because of their names, not the content they
deliver. Aside from that, the impression was positive.</p>

It was a very big (over 1200 people) and a very well organized
Java conference. The food, the location, the logistics, everything. My
presentation was carefully screened beforehand by the organizers and I received a few
valuable corrections. The content, I would say, was not so perfect. I would
recommend to look at new names in the industry and invite those who are less
known but working on something hot and interesting. Besides that, the event
was perfect.</p>

It was one of the best conferences I&#39;ve attended so far. A very well organized,
carefully planned, in a perfect and rather expensive location. Besides that,
my speech was screened beforehand. I even had to make it over Skype and some
corrections were received. What I would suggest to invite new speakers &mdash;
it seems that there are almost the same faces every year.</p>

It was a huge event with, I guess, over 1500 attendees. Even on my presentation
there were over 150 people in the room. The location, the food, the logistics &mdash;
everything was good. The only negative part is a total disfocus of the
content. Speakers were talking just about everything. I didn&#39;t even understand

The event was free-to-enter, but very well organized. The location was
comfortable, the audience motivated enough and the organizers really
cared about the event. The only bad thing was a total absence of speakers
screening. Nobody checked my presentation before and I can only assume
that the same happened to other speakers.</p>

The place was good, the food was very good, the organization was not bad, but
the audience was rather old and out-of-subject. Maybe system engineering is
not really my thing, but most of these guys live somewhere in 1990. And there
were less than a hundred people for four tracks. Just about twenty per
presentation. It&#39;s not really a conference, but more like a meetup.</p>

It&#39;s a very small conference, with barely ten (!) people in the room. The
talks were separated in six rooms, with no specific focus on subjects. Moreover,
I don&#39;t think they did any prepareation of speakers or even selection of them.
Clearly, the event was there only to make money. The only thing I enjoyed
was the city, one of my favorites, &mdash; Seattle. Aside from that, it was

Looks like these DataRobot (the sponsor of the event) guys
care about quality and do this with passion. There were about 180 people at
my speech and the reaction of the audience was rather active. What this event can improve
is to pay attention to the preparation of speakers and limiting their number
to just four. They had too many (six) and most of the talks were rather boring, overloaded
with text-rich slides. Also, the place should definitely be changed, NSC Olimpiyskiy
is just a trash. To be honest, there previous event in Fedoriv Hub was much better
(I would give it an &quot;A&quot;).</p>

That was a huge event with, I would say, over 2000 participants and almost
zero efforts from organizers to make it interesting. Talks were mostly
from sponsors, promoting their own products, or from clowns making
living by talking about &quot;why writing clean code is important&quot;.
Needless to say that they didn&#39;t
compensate travel expenses of speakers, while making a lot of money
on tickets. It was a waste of time and money.</p>

interested and engaged. The place was comfortable, equipment was of
good quality, the focus was right on my talk, since I was the only presenter.

The place was a total trash (small rooms in NSC Olimpiyskiy) with bad light,
bad sound and lack of proper ventilation. There was no preparation of talks
or any communication with speakers. These guys are just making money
in a hype market. It&#39;s a shame.</p>

There were less than a hundred people in total, separated by, I guess, four rooms.
A rather small event, but participants were active. Agile is in general
a very boring subject, maybe that&#39;s why the event was also rather slow, despite
all the attempts of organizers to make it fun.</p>
