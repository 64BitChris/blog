What they still\nare missing, I believe, is the interaction between speakers and the audience\noutside of the presentation rooms.

Maybe because it was not Java community, I didn't\nget as much value from the event as I was getting from JPoint, but the\noverall impression was good.

Its\nstrong points are the social activities between speakers, the community,\nequipment, location, accommodation, and help with travel. Its weak points\nstill are the content and its focus on the Russian-speaking community.

This was\nmy first time there, and I enjoyed almost everything: the location, the\norganization, travel planning, equipment, and audience. The only thing I didn't\nlike was the quality of food. Aside from that, I would say that JBreak is an\neven better event than JPoint.

The venue (Radisson) was perfect, but the number of tracks was too many. There\nwere fewer than 30 people in my room.

The venue was not\ncomfortable at all (it was a cinema), there were no tables for food, and we\nwere eating lunch in cinema chairs :) The number of talks and tracks was\ntoo many, and the audience was very unfocused. What seriously affected my\nimpression was the way listeners left the rooms during the talks;\ncheck out this [tweet](https://twitter.com/yegor256/status/731113702691352576).\nBesides that, the organization was rather formal and messy.

What\nI didn't really like was the food and the venue. (We even had some other\nconference going on in the room next to us.) Also, the audience was not really\nengaged nor prepared, as it seemed to me. I believe this event may improve\nand become better; the potential is definitely there.\n\n<div class=\"talk-event\">&nbsp;</div>\n<aside class=\"venue-rate green\">B-</aside>\n<img src=\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pt9uHp35fwM/mqdefault.jpg\" class=\"past-talk\" alt=\"NTPM 2016\"/>\nMeetings or Discipline;\n[New Trends in Project Management](http://ntpm.pl/);\nGdynia, Poland;\n26 April 2016;\n[slides](http://www.slideshare.net/YegorBugayenko/meetings-or-discipline),\n[photos](https://www.facebook.com/yegor256/posts/10209365963416001),\n[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pt9uHp35fwM).\nIt was an interesting event, mostly because the audience was full\nof questions and really interested in project management. The location, the\nfood, logistics, etc. were good enough. I didn't really like the content\nother speakers were delivering, though. I suspect that most of them were invited\nthere because of their names.\n\n<div class=\"talk-event\">&nbsp;</div>\n<aside class=\"venue-rate green\">B-</aside>\n<img src=\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-Y4XS7ZtQ2g/mqdefault.jpg\" class=\"past-talk\" alt=\"JET Conference 2016\"/>\nAn Immutable Object-Oriented Web Framework;\nJET Conference;\nMinsk, Belarus;\n25 April 2016;\n[photos](https://www.facebook.com/yegor256/posts/10209351820262431),\n[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y4XS7ZtQ2g).\nThere were about 250 people present. The location was not good at all&mdash;it was a cinema.\nAlso, the audience was so serious or so shy that it\nwas rather difficult to present. Not just for me. Also, I got an impression\nthat speakers were invited just because of their names, not the content they\ndeliver. Aside from that, the impression was positive.\n\n<div class=\"talk-event\">&nbsp;</div>\n<aside class=\"venue-rate green\">A-</aside>\n<img src=\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aER4uwyFbqQ/mqdefault.jpg\" class=\"past-talk\" alt=\"JPoint 2016\"/>\nORM - это обидно (ORM Is an Offensive Anti-Pattern);\n[JPoint 2016](http://javapoint.ru/en/);\nMoscow, Russia;\n22-24 April 2016;\n[slides](http://www.slideshare.net/YegorBugayenko/orm-is-offensive),\n[photos](https://www.facebook.com/yegor256/posts/10209338227802628),\n[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aER4uwyFbqQ).\nIt was a very big (more than 1,200 people) and a very well-organized\nJava conference. The food, the location, the logistics, everything. My\npresentation was carefully screened beforehand by the organizers, and I received a few\nvaluable corrections. The content, I would say, was not so perfect. I would\nrecommend looking at new names in the industry, and invite those who are less\nknown but working on something hot and interesting.

Besides that,\nmy speech was screened beforehand. I even had to present it over Skype, and some\ncorrections were received.

Even for my presentation,\nthere were 150 people in the room. The location, the food, the logistics&mdash;everything was good.\nThe only negative part was a total lack of focus on the\ncontent.

The location was\ncomfortable, the audience was motivated enough, and the organizers really\ncared about the event. The only bad thing was a total absence of speaker\nscreening.

There were about 180 people at\nmy speech, and the reaction from the audience was rather active. What this event can improve\non is to pay attention to the preparation of speakers and limit their number\nto just four. They had too many (six), and most of the talks were rather boring, overloaded\nwith text-rich slides. Also, the place should definitely be changed; NSC Olimpiyskiy\nis just trash.

What they still\nare missing, I believe, is the interaction between speakers and the audience\noutside of the presentation rooms.

Its\nstrong points are the social activities between speakers, the community,\nequipment, location, accommodation, and help with travel. Its weak points\nstill are the content and its focus on the Russian-speaking community. It would be\ngreat if they could make their events more international and less \&quot;Russian-only.\&quot;\nAside from that, this is definitely an event I would try to attend again.\n\n&lt;div class=\&quot;talk-event\&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;aside class=\&quot;venue-rate green\&quot;&gt;A&lt;/aside&gt;\n&lt;img src=\&quot;https://i.ytimg.com/vi/85B3FV_sB60/mqdefault.jpg\&quot; class=\&quot;past-talk\&quot; alt=\&quot;JBreak 2017\&quot;/&gt;\nUtility Classes Are Killing Us;\n[JBreak 2017](https://2017.jbreak.ru/speakers/yegor-bugayenko/);\nNovosibirsk, Russia;\n4 April 2017;\n[видео](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85B3FV_sB60) (with English subtitles),\n[slides](https://www.slideshare.net/YegorBugayenko/utility-classes-are-killing-us).\nYet another great event by [JUG.ru](https://jug.ru/) in Siberia. This was\nmy first time there, and I enjoyed almost everything: the location, the\norganization, travel planning, equipment, and audience. The only thing I didn't\nlike was the quality of food. Aside from that, I would say that JBreak is an\neven better event than JPoint. Maybe because I like smaller one-day events more than\nbigger ones that take a few days.\n\n&lt;div class=\&quot;talk-event\&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;aside class=\&quot;venue-rate green\&quot;&gt;B+&lt;/aside&gt;\n&lt;img src=\&quot;https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MSBf2RftCKo/mqdefault.jpg\&quot; class=\&quot;past-talk\&quot; alt=\&quot;DevOn Summit 2017\&quot;/&gt;\nA Few Best Practices for Time-Wasting on a Software Team;\n[DevOn Summit 2017](http://www.devonsummit.com/speakers/);\nDelft, The Netherlands;\n30 March 2017;\n[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSBf2RftCKo).\nSurprisingly, the event was rather good, even though it was commercial\nand put on by a private company (usually such events suck). This one was well-\norganized with interesting speakers, good equipment, and a lot of passion\nfrom the team. I received a lot of negative comments from the audience about\nmy subject, but that's how it has to be with the problem I'm discussing. I'll\ndefinitely recommend it next year.\n\n&lt;div class=\&quot;talk-event\&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;aside class=\&quot;venue-rate green\&quot;&gt;B-&lt;/aside&gt;\n&lt;img src=\&quot;https://i.ytimg.com/vi/TLM9eN0b6zo/mqdefault.jpg\&quot; class=\&quot;past-talk\&quot; alt=\&quot;AgileDays 2017\&quot;/&gt;\nИзбавляйтесь от экспертов;\nAgileDays 2017;\nMoscow, Russia;\n24 March 2017;\n[видео](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLM9eN0b6zo).\nThe event was rather big, and the audience rather active, but I didn't really\nfeel like I was \&quot;there.\&quot; In the two days I was there, I didn't even meet anybody\nfrom the team that organized it. I was by myself, sitting in the lobby, waiting\nfor my slot&amp;mdash;this is not what motivates a speaker. Aside from that,\neverything was decent: the food, the equipment, the location, the travel, etc.\nI believe it's important to be there, because the event is rather big.\n\n&lt;div class=\&quot;talk-event\&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;img src=\&quot;https://i.ytimg.com/vi/biE86esgFAE/mqdefault.jpg\&quot; class=\&quot;past-talk\&quot; alt=\&quot;AgileDays 2017\&quot;/&gt;\nСемь врагов нашей мотивации;\nAgileDays 2017;\nMoscow, Russia;\n24 March 2017;\n[видео](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biE86esgFAE).\n\n&lt;div class=\&quot;talk-event\&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;aside class=\&quot;venue-rate orange\&quot;&gt;C&lt;/aside&gt;\n&lt;img src=\&quot;https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lvoQZGsY56k/mqdefault.jpg\&quot; class=\&quot;past-talk\&quot; alt=\&quot;Kharkiv PMDay 2017\&quot;/&gt;\nManagement Without Managers;\n[Kharkiv PMDay](http://kh.pmday.org/yehor-buhayenko2017s/);\nKharkiv, Ukraine;\n4 March 2017;\n[slides](https://www.slideshare.net/YegorBugayenko/management-without-managers),\n[видео](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvoQZGsY56k) (with English subtitles).\nYet another event by [LemBS](http://lembs.com/), this time in Kharkiv.\nThe organization was rather good: the travel and accommodation, the food, the\nequipment.

For that size of a conference, organizers need\nto do way more \&quot;social\&quot; work for speakers and everybody else. I made almost\nno connections there, and most people I met had the same problem. It's a typical\nissue for big conferences&amp;mdash;you simply get lost.

I liked the event. A few things definitely\nneed to be improved, though: the food and the number of tracks. There were too many tracks,\nI guess, for the number of people who attended. It would be better to invite fewer\nspeakers and focus the audience on the best of them. And spend\nthe money they saved on better food.\n\n&lt;div class=\&quot;talk-event\&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;img src=\&quot;https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cGcCcxx4xrg/mqdefault.jpg\&quot; class=\&quot;past-talk\&quot; alt=\&quot;JavaDay Kyiv 2016\&quot;/&gt;\nJava vs. OOP;\n[JavaDay Kyiv 2016](http://javaday.org.ua/kyiv/);\nKyiv, Ukraine;\n15 October 2016;\n[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGcCcxx4xrg).\n\n&lt;div class=\&quot;talk-event\&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;img src=\&quot;https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Y-16C5yhKLo/mqdefault.jpg\&quot; class=\&quot;past-talk\&quot; alt=\&quot;JavaDay Kyiv 2016\&quot;/&gt;\nTrial by Combat for OOP Honor (in Russian);\n[JavaDay Kyiv 2016](http://javaday.org.ua/kyiv/);\nKyiv, Ukraine;\n15 October 2016;\n[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-16C5yhKLo).\n\n&lt;div class=\&quot;talk-event\&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;img src=\&quot;https://i.ytimg.com/vi/A-9FjaOIsw8/mqdefault.jpg\&quot; class=\&quot;past-talk\&quot; alt=\&quot;Object Thinking Meetup #2\&quot;/&gt;\nWhy Static Methods Are Evil;\n[Object Thinking Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Object-Thinking/events/232602670/);\nStanford, Palo Alto, CA, USA;\n9 August 2016;\n[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-9FjaOIsw8).\n\n&lt;div class=\&quot;talk-event\&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;img src=\&quot;https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pynZF10U880/mqdefault.jpg\&quot; class=\&quot;past-talk\&quot; alt=\&quot;Object Thinking Meetup #1\&quot;/&gt;\nHow Anemic Objects Kill OOP;\n[Object Thinking](http://www.meetup.com/Object-Thinking-in-Silicon-Valley/events/228145728/) (Meetup #1);\nPalo Alto, CA, USA;\n12 July 2016;\n[slides](http://www.slideshare.net/YegorBugayenko/how-anemic-objects-kill-oop),\n[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pynZF10U880).\n\n&lt;div class=\&quot;talk-event\&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;aside class=\&quot;venue-rate green\&quot;&gt;B-&lt;/aside&gt;\n&lt;img src=\&quot;https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3dJP_LtUGgg/mqdefault.jpg\&quot; class=\&quot;past-talk\&quot; alt=\&quot;SLC DevOpsDays 2016\&quot;/&gt;\n8 Maturity Levels of Continuous Integration;\nSalt Lake City DevOpsDays;\nSalt Lake City, UT, USA;\n15 June 2016;\n[slides](http://www.slideshare.net/YegorBugayenko/eight-maturity-levels-of-continuous-integration),\n[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dJP_LtUGgg).\nThere were about 250 people with just one track and a pretty good\norganization, even though the budget was rather low.

Even though the budget\nwas rather low, they paid for travel and hotel, and invited speakers mostly\nfrom abroad. The audience was well-prepared for my talk, and I got many questions\nright after the presentation and throughout the rest of the day.

There were more than 500 attendees\nand just two tracks (when I was speaking). The venue was very comfortable,\nmodern, and located within walking distance from the center. All the logistics\nwere done perfectly, the food was of high quality, the team was personally\nthere and in permanent contact with speakers.

Aside from that, everything else was not so good. There was\nno focus on content, the audience wasn't prepared at all, and there were many\nsponsor booths.

Seriously,\nthe place was a total disaster, even though it's a newly built conference\ncenter. The sound, the location of rooms, the after-talk areas&amp;mdash;everything\nwas uncomfortable. Also, the content was not really well-selected. They invited\na few star speakers just because of their names, which is usually a mistake.\nThe after-party was good, though.

The venue, the food, and\nthe transportation were rather good, taking into account the ticket price. Besides\nthat, the audience was very motivated and engaged. The only downside was a very\nshort time slot for each talk (30 minutes), very short breaks (10 minutes), and\nthe number of speakers. It felt too crowded.

Not perfect, but very good. There were about\n300 people and four tracks (I think it's too many). The only problem was\nwith the content.

Just two tracks for about 400\nattendees, a motivated audience, good equipment, video recording, etc. What I\nobviously didn't like was the venue (not really comfortable), the mess with\nthe schedule (my talk was delayed for more than 30 minutes), and an absence\nof focus on a specific subject.

The venue (Radisson) was perfect, but the number of tracks was too many. There\nwere fewer than 30 people in my room.

The venue was not\ncomfortable at all (it was a cinema), there were no tables for food, and we\nwere eating lunch in cinema chairs :) The number of talks and tracks was\ntoo many, and the audience was very unfocused. What seriously affected my\nimpression was the way listeners left the rooms during the talks;\ncheck out this [tweet](https://twitter.com/yegor256/status/731113702691352576).\nBesides that, the organization was rather formal and messy.

What\nI didn't really like was the food and the venue. (We even had some other\nconference going on in the room next to us.) Also, the audience was not really\nengaged nor prepared, as it seemed to me.

The food, the location, the logistics, everything. My\npresentation was carefully screened beforehand by the organizers, and I received a few\nvaluable corrections.

The audience was actively\nengaged and asked a lot of questions. There were about a hundred people at my talk.\nThe quality of the location was average, and my expenses\nwere not reimbursed. Also, the content was not really well-prepared or monitored.\n\n&lt;div class=\&quot;talk-event\&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;aside class=\&quot;venue-rate green\&quot;&gt;B-&lt;/aside&gt;\n&lt;img src=\&quot;https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dE0_j4Kk6jo/mqdefault.jpg\&quot; class=\&quot;past-talk\&quot; alt=\&quot;Agilia Conference 2016\&quot;/&gt;\nMeetings Help Us and Kill Our Projects;\n[Agilia Conference 2016](http://agiliaconference.com/agilia-conference-2016/speakers/yegor-bugayenko/);\nOlomouc, Czech Republic;\n5 April 2016\n[slides](http://www.slideshare.net/YegorBugayenko/meetings-help-us-and-kill-our-projects),\n[photos](https://www.facebook.com/yegor256/posts/10209204748545730),\n[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dE0_j4Kk6jo).\nThere were more than 250 people and just two main tracks&amp;mdash;a good setup.\nIt was a comfortable location, careful organization, good food, and expenses were\npaid. The only problem was the content. Most presentations\nwere rather boring and not well-prepared.

Maybe system engineering is\nnot really my thing, but most of these guys live somewhere in the 1990s. And there\nwere fewer than a hundred people for four tracks. Just about 20 per\npresentation. It's not really a conference but more like a meetup.\n\n&lt;div class=\&quot;talk-event\&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;aside class=\&quot;venue-rate red\&quot;&gt;F-&lt;/aside&gt;\nMicroservices as Chat Bots;\n[CascadiaIT](http://casitconf.org/casitconf16/talks/);\nSeattle, WA, USA;\n12 March 2016;\n[slides](http://www.slideshare.net/YegorBugayenko/microservices-as-chat-bots),\n[photos](https://www.facebook.com/yegor256/posts/10208900274414067).\nIt was a very small conference, with barely 10 (!) people in the room. The\ntalks were separated into six rooms, with no specific focus on subjects. Moreover,\nI don't think they did any preparation of speakers or even selection of them.\nClearly, the event was there only to make money. The lone thing I enjoyed\nwas the city, one of my favorites,&amp;mdash;Seattle.

There were about 180 people at\nmy speech, and the reaction from the audience was rather active. What this event can improve\non is to pay attention to the preparation of speakers and limit their number\nto just four. They had too many (six), and most of the talks were rather boring, overloaded\nwith text-rich slides. Also, the place should definitely be changed; NSC Olimpiyskiy\nis just trash. To be honest, the previous event at Fedoriv Hub was much better\n(I would give it an \&quot;A\&quot;).\n\n&lt;div class=\&quot;talk-event\&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;aside class=\&quot;venue-rate red\&quot;&gt;F&lt;/aside&gt;\n&lt;img src=\&quot;https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mHCwlZSlZeU/mqdefault.jpg\&quot; class=\&quot;past-talk\&quot; alt=\&quot;DeveloperWeek 2015\&quot;/&gt;\nTalk to Your Microservice Via a Chat Bot, Not UI;\n[DeveloperWeek 2016](http://www.developerweek.com/);\nSan Francisco, CA, USA;\n17 February 2016;\n[slides](http://www.slideshare.net/YegorBugayenko/chat-bots-are-the-new-ui),\n[photos](https://www.facebook.com/yegor256/posts/10208695807182514),\n[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHCwlZSlZeU).\nThis was a shame for the entire industry&amp;mdash;a money-making event with\nzero attention to quality.

Talks were mostly\nfrom sponsors promoting their own products or from clowns making a\nliving by talking about \&quot;why writing clean code is important.\&quot;\nNeedless to say, they didn't\ncompensate travel expenses for speakers, even while making a lot of money\non tickets.

What they still\nare missing, I believe, is the interaction between speakers and the audience\noutside of the presentation rooms.

Maybe because it was not Java community, I didn't\nget as much value from the event as I was getting from JPoint, but the\noverall impression was good.

Its\nstrong points are the social activities between speakers, the community,\nequipment, location, accommodation, and help with travel. Its weak points\nstill are the content and its focus on the Russian-speaking community. It would be\ngreat if they could make their events more international and less \"Russian-only.\"\nAside from that, this is definitely an event I would try to attend again.\n\n<div class=\"talk-event\">&nbsp;</div>\n<aside class=\"venue-rate green\">A</aside>\n<img src=\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/85B3FV_sB60/mqdefault.jpg\" class=\"past-talk\" alt=\"JBreak 2017\"/>\nUtility Classes Are Killing Us;\n[JBreak 2017](https://2017.jbreak.ru/speakers/yegor-bugayenko/);\nNovosibirsk, Russia;\n4 April 2017;\n[видео](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85B3FV_sB60) (with English subtitles),\n[slides](https://www.slideshare.net/YegorBugayenko/utility-classes-are-killing-us).\nYet another great event by [JUG.ru](https://jug.ru/) in Siberia. This was\nmy first time there, and I enjoyed almost everything: the location, the\norganization, travel planning, equipment, and audience. The only thing I didn't\nlike was the quality of food. Aside from that, I would say that JBreak is an\neven better event than JPoint. Maybe because I like smaller one-day events more than\nbigger ones that take a few days.\n\n<div class=\"talk-event\">&nbsp;</div>\n<aside class=\"venue-rate green\">B+</aside>\n<img src=\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MSBf2RftCKo/mqdefault.jpg\" class=\"past-talk\" alt=\"DevOn Summit 2017\"/>\nA Few Best Practices for Time-Wasting on a Software Team;\n[DevOn Summit 2017](http://www.devonsummit.com/speakers/);\nDelft, The Netherlands;\n30 March 2017;\n[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSBf2RftCKo).\nSurprisingly, the event was rather good, even though it was commercial\nand put on by a private company (usually such events suck). This one was well-\norganized with interesting speakers, good equipment, and a lot of passion\nfrom the team. I received a lot of negative comments from the audience about\nmy subject, but that's how it has to be with the problem I'm discussing.

I was by myself, sitting in the lobby, waiting\nfor my slot&mdash;this is not what motivates a speaker.

The venue was not\ncomfortable at all (it was a cinema), there were no tables for food, and we\nwere eating lunch in cinema chairs :) The number of talks and tracks was\ntoo many, and the audience was very unfocused. What seriously affected my\nimpression was the way listeners left the rooms during the talks;\ncheck out this [tweet](https://twitter.com/yegor256/status/731113702691352576).\nBesides that, the organization was rather formal and messy.

What\nI didn't really like was the food and the venue. (We even had some other\nconference going on in the room next to us.) Also, the audience was not really\nengaged nor prepared, as it seemed to me. I believe this event may improve\nand become better; the potential is definitely there.\n\n<div class=\"talk-event\">&nbsp;</div>\n<aside class=\"venue-rate green\">B-</aside>\n<img src=\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pt9uHp35fwM/mqdefault.jpg\" class=\"past-talk\" alt=\"NTPM 2016\"/>\nMeetings or Discipline;\n[New Trends in Project Management](http://ntpm.pl/);\nGdynia, Poland;\n26 April 2016;\n[slides](http://www.slideshare.net/YegorBugayenko/meetings-or-discipline),\n[photos](https://www.facebook.com/yegor256/posts/10209365963416001),\n[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pt9uHp35fwM).\nIt was an interesting event, mostly because the audience was full\nof questions and really interested in project management. The location, the\nfood, logistics, etc. were good enough. I didn't really like the content\nother speakers were delivering, though. I suspect that most of them were invited\nthere because of their names.\n\n<div class=\"talk-event\">&nbsp;</div>\n<aside class=\"venue-rate green\">B-</aside>\n<img src=\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-Y4XS7ZtQ2g/mqdefault.jpg\" class=\"past-talk\" alt=\"JET Conference 2016\"/>\nAn Immutable Object-Oriented Web Framework;\nJET Conference;\nMinsk, Belarus;\n25 April 2016;\n[photos](https://www.facebook.com/yegor256/posts/10209351820262431),\n[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y4XS7ZtQ2g).\nThere were about 250 people present. The location was not good at all&mdash;it was a cinema.\nAlso, the audience was so serious or so shy that it\nwas rather difficult to present. Not just for me. Also, I got an impression\nthat speakers were invited just because of their names, not the content they\ndeliver. Aside from that, the impression was positive.\n\n<div class=\"talk-event\">&nbsp;</div>\n<aside class=\"venue-rate green\">A-</aside>\n<img src=\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aER4uwyFbqQ/mqdefault.jpg\" class=\"past-talk\" alt=\"JPoint 2016\"/>\nORM - это обидно (ORM Is an Offensive Anti-Pattern);\n[JPoint 2016](http://javapoint.ru/en/);\nMoscow, Russia;\n22-24 April 2016;\n[slides](http://www.slideshare.net/YegorBugayenko/orm-is-offensive),\n[photos](https://www.facebook.com/yegor256/posts/10209338227802628),\n[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aER4uwyFbqQ).\nIt was a very big (more than 1,200 people) and a very well-organized\nJava conference. The food, the location, the logistics, everything. My\npresentation was carefully screened beforehand by the organizers, and I received a few\nvaluable corrections. The content, I would say, was not so perfect. I would\nrecommend looking at new names in the industry, and invite those who are less\nknown but working on something hot and interesting. Besides that, the event\nwas perfect.\n\n<div class=\"talk-event\">&nbsp;</div>\n<aside class=\"venue-rate green\">A</aside>\n<img src=\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/F4N25kZ2zQU/mqdefault.jpg\" class=\"past-talk\" alt=\"JPoint 2016 Students Day\"/>\nОбъектно-Ориентированное Вранье (Object-Oriented Lies);\n[Student Day](http://students.javapoint.ru/talks/bugaenko/)\nMoscow, Russia;\n22-24 April 2016;\n[slides](http://www.slideshare.net/YegorBugayenko/object-oriented-lies),\n[photos](https://www.facebook.com/yegor256/posts/10209338227802628),\n[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4N25kZ2zQU).\nIt was one of the best conferences I've attended so far, very well-organized and\ncarefully planned in a perfect and rather expensive location. Besides that,\nmy speech was screened beforehand. I even had to present it over Skype, and some\ncorrections were received. I would suggest inviting new speakers&mdash;it seems there are almost the same faces every year.\n\n<div class=\"talk-event\">&nbsp;</div>\n<aside class=\"venue-rate green\">B-</aside>\n<img src=\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gL4XwP-EBOg/mqdefault.jpg\" class=\"past-talk\" alt=\"WEBIT.Festival 2016\"/>\nContinuous Integration May Have Negative Effects;\n[WEBIT.Festival 2016](http://www.webit.bg/speaker.php?id=2128);\nSophia, Bulgaria;\n20 April 2016;\n[photos](https://www.facebook.com/yegor256/posts/10209310350105703),\n[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gL4XwP-EBOg).\nIt was a huge event with, I'd guess, more than 1,500 attendees. Even for my presentation,\nthere were 150 people in the room. The location, the food, the logistics&mdash;everything was good.\nThe only negative part was a total lack of focus on the\ncontent.

The location was\ncomfortable, the audience was motivated enough, and the organizers really\ncared about the event. The only bad thing was a total absence of speaker\nscreening. Nobody checked my presentation beforehand, and I can only assume\nthat the same happened to other speakers.\n\n<div class=\"talk-event\">&nbsp;</div>\n<aside class=\"venue-rate green\">B+</aside>\n<img src=\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xbovkm0tTn0/mqdefault.jpg\" class=\"past-talk\" alt=\"AgileEE 2016\"/>\nMeetings Are a Threat to Code Quality;\n[AgileEE 2016](http://kiev2016.agileee.org/);\nKiev, Ukraine;\n9 April 2016\n[slides](http://www.slideshare.net/YegorBugayenko/meetings-are-a-threat-to-code-quality),\n[photos](https://www.facebook.com/yegor256/posts/10209222357985955);\n[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbovkm0tTn0).\nThe organization, food, location, audience, welcoming, and departing were very good, but\nthe content was rather poor.

Maybe system engineering is\nnot really my thing, but most of these guys live somewhere in the 1990s. And there\nwere fewer than a hundred people for four tracks. Just about 20 per\npresentation.

The\ntalks were separated into six rooms, with no specific focus on subjects. Moreover,\nI don't think they did any preparation of speakers or even selection of them.\nClearly, the event was there only to make money.

There were about 180 people at\nmy speech, and the reaction from the audience was rather active. What this event can improve\non is to pay attention to the preparation of speakers and limit their number\nto just four. They had too many (six), and most of the talks were rather boring, overloaded\nwith text-rich slides. Also, the place should definitely be changed; NSC Olimpiyskiy\nis just trash.

It was my second year with these guys and I liked it more than in 2016. The travel, the food, the equipment, the venue were very good. What they still are missing, I believe, is the interaction between speakers and the audience outside of the presentation rooms. They need to work harder, I believe, to connect me with my listeners before the show and after it. Also, to connect me with other speakers. Aside from that, they are definitely growing, I will try to attend next year.</p><div class="talk-event">&nbsp;</div><aside class="venue-rate green">B+</aside><p><img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3QT7jaoOa9w/mqdefault.jpg" class="past-talk" alt="DotNext 2017" /> TDD Upside Down; <a href="https://dotnext-moscow.ru/2017/msk/talks/3ehxgjdfiiws4kkygqa4qc/">DotNext 2017</a>; Moscow, Russia; 12-13 November 2017; <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/secret/cUPqyS0ZwPhKL6">slides</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QT7jaoOa9w">видео</a>. The event was organized by JUG.ru guys (authors of JPoint and Joker) and it was rather good, as usual. Maybe because it was not Java community, I didn’t get as much value from the event as I was getting from JPoint, but the overall impression was good. The accomodation, the venue, the equipment, the food were perfect. What I missed was the promotional part and the social activity around the talks.</p><div class="talk-event">&nbsp;</div><p><img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VQtdNQd7wIU/mqdefault.jpg" class="past-talk" alt="Семинар в ДНУ" /> Four factors of success; <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10214062047615171">Семинар в ДНУ</a> (Днепропетровский Государственный Университет, факультет “Международные Отношения,” кафедра “Международная Экономика”)<br /> Dnepr, Ukraine; 13 September 2017; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQtdNQd7wIU">видео</a>.</p><div class="talk-event">&nbsp;</div><aside class="venue-rate green">B-</aside><p><img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nVmRY4Ri4CA/mqdefault.jpg" class="past-talk" alt="PgDay 2017" /> PostgreSQL + Liquibase + Docker + Maven + Java = Integration Tests; <a href="https://pgday.ru/ru/2017/speakers/136">PgDay 2017</a>; St.Peterburg, Russia; 5-7 July 2017; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVmRY4Ri4CA">video</a>. The conference was well organized, but rather small for five tracks. There were no more than 30 people at my talk. The venue was far away from the city center which made it difficult to see the historic center of Saint Peterburg. The equipment was not of a high quality. The food was great, the audience was well prepared, the organizers friendly.</p><div class="talk-event">&nbsp;</div><aside class="venue-rate green">B</aside><p><img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cv23Z6xpwDw/mqdefault.jpg" class="past-talk" alt="JDK.IO 2017" /> Java Annotations Are a Bad Idea; <a href="http://www.jdk.io/">JDK IO 2017</a>; Copenhagen, Denmark; 19-20 June 2017; <a href="https://youtu.be/cv23Z6xpwDw">video</a>, <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/YegorBugayenko/java-annotations-are-a-bad-idea">slides</a>. The food, the accomodation, the audience, the equipment was good. The location was rather far away from the hotel. Aside from that, the conference was surprisingly good, even though I was told that in 2016 there were not enough attendees. This year there were just two tracks, about 80 people at my talk. Will be glad to visit again.</p><div class="talk-event">&nbsp;</div><aside class="venue-rate green">C+</aside><p><img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/oiNI2jF46h0/mqdefault.jpg" class="past-talk" alt="BDMSummit 2017 Summer" /> Make Customers Trust You; <a href="http://bdmsummit.com/yegor-bugayenko-2017s/">BDMSummit 2017</a>; Kiev, Ukraine; 17 June 2017; <a href="https://youtu.be/oiNI2jF46h0">video</a>, <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/YegorBugayenko/make-customers-trust-you">slides</a>.

There were some technical problems in my talk (you can see them in the video), but aside from that the event was interesting and well-organized. The team definitely did it with passion and invested a lot of effort in it. Maybe a better warming up social procedures would be helpful next year.

As usual, this conference was very good, but this year something was missing. The venue was perfect, the accomodation, the team, the audience, the equipment at the highest level. I guess the content could be better with the budget these guys have available. More cutting-edge talks, more panel discussions, more provocation, more scandals. It was rather quiet and routine.

The event was very big, but many things were not as good as I would expect. It was in the cinema, as in 2016—not the best location, if you ask me. The food was average, the accomodation too.

JPoint is one of the best tech conferences I’ve spoken at so far. Its strong points are the social activities between speakers, the community, equipment, location, accommodation, and help with travel. Its weak points still are the content and its focus on the Russian-speaking community. It would be great if they could make their events more international and less “Russian-only.” Aside from that, this is definitely an event I would try to attend again.</p><div class="talk-event">&nbsp;</div><aside class="venue-rate green">A</aside><p><img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/85B3FV_sB60/mqdefault.jpg" class="past-talk" alt="JBreak 2017" /> Utility Classes Are Killing Us; <a href="https://2017.jbreak.ru/speakers/yegor-bugayenko/">JBreak 2017</a>; Novosibirsk, Russia; 4 April 2017; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85B3FV_sB60">видео</a> (with English subtitles), <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/YegorBugayenko/utility-classes-are-killing-us">slides</a>. Yet another great event by <a href="https://jug.ru/">JUG.ru</a> in Siberia. This was my first time there, and I enjoyed almost everything: the location, the organization, travel planning, equipment, and audience. The only thing I didn’t like was the quality of food. Aside from that, I would say that JBreak is an even better event than JPoint. Maybe because I like smaller one-day events more than bigger ones that take a few days.</p><div class="talk-event">&nbsp;</div><aside class="venue-rate green">B+</aside><p><img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MSBf2RftCKo/mqdefault.jpg" class="past-talk" alt="DevOn Summit 2017" /> A Few Best Practices for Time-Wasting on a Software Team; <a href="http://www.devonsummit.com/speakers/">DevOn Summit 2017</a>; Delft, The Netherlands; 30 March 2017; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSBf2RftCKo">video</a>. Surprisingly, the event was rather good, even though it was commercial and put on by a private company (usually such events suck). This one was well- organized with interesting speakers, good equipment, and a lot of passion from the team. I received a lot of negative comments from the audience about my subject, but that’s how it has to be with the problem I’m discussing. I’ll definitely recommend it next year.</p><div class="talk-event">&nbsp;</div><aside class="venue-rate green">B-</aside><p><img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/TLM9eN0b6zo/mqdefault.jpg" class="past-talk" alt="AgileDays 2017" /> Избавляйтесь от экспертов; AgileDays 2017; Moscow, Russia; 24 March 2017; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLM9eN0b6zo">видео</a>. The event was rather big, and the audience rather active, but I didn’t really feel like I was “there.” In the two days I was there, I didn’t even meet anybody from the team that organized it. I was by myself, sitting in the lobby, waiting for my slot—this is not what motivates a speaker. Aside from that, everything was decent: the food, the equipment, the location, the travel, etc. I believe it’s important to be there, because the event is rather big.</p><div class="talk-event">&nbsp;</div><p><img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/biE86esgFAE/mqdefault.jpg" class="past-talk" alt="AgileDays 2017" /> Семь врагов нашей мотивации; AgileDays 2017; Moscow, Russia; 24 March 2017; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biE86esgFAE">видео</a>.</p><div class="talk-event">&nbsp;</div><aside class="venue-rate orange">C</aside><p><img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lvoQZGsY56k/mqdefault.jpg" class="past-talk" alt="Kharkiv PMDay 2017" /> Management Without Managers; <a href="http://kh.pmday.org/yehor-buhayenko2017s/">Kharkiv PMDay</a>; Kharkiv, Ukraine; 4 March 2017; <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/YegorBugayenko/management-without-managers">slides</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvoQZGsY56k">видео</a> (with English subtitles).

The event was <del>pretty</del> too big; I would say about 800 attendees, 60 speakers, six tracks, and three full days plus workshops. For that size of a conference, organizers need to do way more “social” work for speakers and everybody else. I made almost no connections there, and most people I met had the same problem. It’s a typical issue for big conferences—you simply get lost. At this one, they had every chance to make a great event, but… Aside from that, the venue was great, the food was good, and the travel and accommodation were perfect.

The venue was great, the size average (about 500 people), and organizers were very friendly and motivated. I liked the event. A few things definitely need to be improved, though: the food and the number of tracks. There were too many tracks, I guess, for the number of people who attended. It would be better to invite fewer speakers and focus the audience on the best of them.

It was a surprisingly well-organized one-day event with more than 300 attendees, two tracks, and an inexpensive entry ticket ($75). Even though the budget was rather low, they paid for travel and hotel, and invited speakers mostly from abroad. The audience was well-prepared for my talk, and I got many questions right after the presentation and throughout the rest of the day.

The sound, the location of rooms, the after-talk areas—everything was uncomfortable. Also, the content was not really well-selected. They invited a few star speakers just because of their names, which is usually a mistake. The after-party was good, though.

Surprisingly, the conference was very good. Just two tracks for about 400 attendees, a motivated audience, good equipment, video recording, etc. What I obviously didn’t like was the venue (not really comfortable), the mess with the schedule (my talk was delayed for more than 30 minutes), and an absence of focus on a specific subject.

Even though it’s a big (more than 1,000 people) and popular European conference about Java, my overall impression was not really positive. The venue was not comfortable at all (it was a cinema), there were no tables for food, and we were eating lunch in cinema chairs :) The number of talks and tracks was too many, and the audience was very unfocused. What seriously affected my impression was the way listeners left the rooms during the talks; check out this <a href="https://twitter.com/yegor256/status/731113702691352576">tweet</a>.

The conference was rather small (around 150 people), but well-organized. What I didn’t really like was the food and the venue. (We even had some other conference going on in the room next to us.) Also, the audience was not really engaged nor prepared, as it seemed to me.

It was an interesting event, mostly because the audience was full of questions and really interested in project management. The location, the food, logistics, etc. were good enough. I didn’t really like the content other speakers were delivering, though. I suspect that most of them were invited there because of their names.</p><div class="talk-event">&nbsp;</div><aside class="venue-rate green">B-</aside><p><img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-Y4XS7ZtQ2g/mqdefault.jpg" class="past-talk" alt="JET Conference 2016" /> An Immutable Object-Oriented Web Framework; JET Conference; Minsk, Belarus; 25 April 2016; <a href="https://www.facebook.com/yegor256/posts/10209351820262431">photos</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y4XS7ZtQ2g">video</a>. There were about 250 people present. The location was not good at all—it was a cinema. Also, the audience was so serious or so shy that it was rather difficult to present. Not just for me. Also, I got an impression that speakers were invited just because of their names, not the content they deliver.

It was a very big (more than 1,200 people) and a very well-organized Java conference. The food, the location, the logistics, everything. My presentation was carefully screened beforehand by the organizers, and I received a few valuable corrections. The content, I would say, was not so perfect. I would recommend looking at new names in the industry, and invite those who are less known but working on something hot and interesting. Besides that, the event was perfect.</p><div class="talk-event">&nbsp;</div><aside class="venue-rate green">A</aside><p><img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/F4N25kZ2zQU/mqdefault.jpg" class="past-talk" alt="JPoint 2016 Students Day" /> Объектно-Ориентированное Вранье (Object-Oriented Lies); <a href="http://students.javapoint.ru/talks/bugaenko/">Student Day</a> Moscow, Russia; 22-24 April 2016; <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/YegorBugayenko/object-oriented-lies">slides</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/yegor256/posts/10209338227802628">photos</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4N25kZ2zQU">video</a>. It was one of the best conferences I’ve attended so far, very well-organized and carefully planned in a perfect and rather expensive location. Besides that, my speech was screened beforehand.

It was a huge event with, I’d guess, more than 1,500 attendees. Even for my presentation, there were 150 people in the room. The location, the food, the logistics—everything was good. The only negative part was a total lack of focus on the content. Speakers were talking about everything.

The event was free to attend but very well-organized. The location was comfortable, the audience was motivated enough, and the organizers really cared about the event.

The place was good, the food was very good, the organization was not bad, but the audience was rather old and out-of-subject.

It was a very small conference, with barely 10 (!) people in the room. The talks were separated into six rooms, with no specific focus on subjects. Moreover, I don’t think they did any preparation of speakers or even selection of them. Clearly, the event was there only to make money. The lone thing I enjoyed was the city, one of my favorites,—Seattle.

Looks like these DataRobot (the sponsor of the event) guys care about quality and do this with passion. There were about 180 people at my speech, and the reaction from the audience was rather active. What this event can improve on is to pay attention to the preparation of speakers and limit their number to just four. They had too many (six), and most of the talks were rather boring, overloaded with text-rich slides. Also, the place should definitely be changed; NSC Olimpiyskiy is just trash. To be honest, the previous event at Fedoriv Hub was much better (I would give it an “A”).</p><div class="talk-event">&nbsp;</div><aside class="venue-rate red">F</aside><p><img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mHCwlZSlZeU/mqdefault.jpg" class="past-talk" alt="DeveloperWeek 2015" /> Talk to Your Microservice Via a Chat Bot, Not UI; <a href="http://www.developerweek.com/">DeveloperWeek 2016</a>; San Francisco, CA, USA; 17 February 2016; <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/YegorBugayenko/chat-bots-are-the-new-ui">slides</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/yegor256/posts/10208695807182514">photos</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHCwlZSlZeU">video</a>.

This was a huge event with, I would say, more than 2,000 participants and almost no effort from organizers to make it interesting.
