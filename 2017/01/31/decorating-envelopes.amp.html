      <h1>Decorating Envelopes</h1>
      <p><del>Sometimes</del> Very often I need a
<a href="/2016/09/20/oop-without-classes.html">class</a> that implements an
interface by making an instance of another class. Sound weird? Let me show
you an example. There are many classes of that kind in the
<a href="http://www.takes.org">Takes Framework</a>,
and they all are named like <code>*Wrap</code>. It's a convenient design concept that,
unfortunately, looks rather verbose in Java. It would be great to have something
shorter, like in <a href="http://www.eolang.org">EO</a> for example.</p>





<p>Take a look at
<a href="https://github.com/yegor256/takes/blob/1.1/src/main/java/org/takes/rs/RsHtml.java"><code>RsHtml</code></a>
from <a href="http://www.takes.org">Takes Framework</a>. Its design looks
like this (a simplified version with only one primary constructor):</p>



<p>Now, let's take a look at that
<a href="https://github.com/yegor256/takes/blob/1.1/src/main/java/org/takes/rs/RsWrap.java"><code>RsWrap</code></a>
it extends:</p>



<p>As you see, this "decorator" doesn't do anything except "just decorating."
It encapsulates another <code>Response</code> and passes through all method calls.</p>

<p>If it's not clear yet, I'll explain the purpose of <code>RsHtml</code>. Let's
say you have text and you want to create a <code>Response</code>:</p>



<p>Instead of doing this
<a href="/2015/02/26/composable-decorators.html">composition of decorators</a>
over and over again in many places, you use <code>RsHtml</code>:</p>



<p>It is very convenient, but that <code>RsWrap</code> is very verbose. There are too many
lines that don't do anything special; they just forward all method
calls to the encapsulated <code>Response</code>.</p>

<p>How about we introduce a new concept, "decorators", with a new
keyword, <code>decorates</code>:</p>



<p>Then, in order to create an object, we just call:</p>



<p>We don't have any new methods in the decorators, just constructors.
The only purpose for these guys is to create other objects and encapsulate
them. They are not really full-purpose objects. They only help us
create other objects.</p>

<p>That's why I would call them "decorating envelopes."</p>

<p>This idea may look very similar to the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factory_%28object-oriented_programming%29">Factory</a> design pattern,
but it doesn't have
<a href="/2014/05/05/oop-alternative-to-utility-classes.html">static methods</a>,
which we are trying to avoid in
<a href="/2016/08/15/what-is-wrong-object-oriented-programming.html">object-oriented programming</a>.</p>
