      <h1>My Favorite Websites</h1>
      <p>I recently <a href="/2017/06/27/my-environment.html">published</a>
a summary of the software and hardware I'm using every day. Now I'll
list my most favorite websites and online services, which help me do my
daily job: write code and manage projects.</p>



<p><br>
<a href="https://www.gmail.com">Gmail</a>
is the best email system. It aggregates all my accounts
in one place: all emails are coming to the <code>@gmail.com</code> address
and I have a few aliases for sending responses.
<a href="https://calendar.google.com">Google Calendar</a> helps me keep my plans in sync,
and <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/my-drive">Google Drive</a> helps me
share documents with friends sometimes.</p>

<p><br>
<a href="https://github.com/yegor256">GitHub</a>
is where we keep our source code repositories. I was also using
<a href="https://bitbucket.com">Bitbucket</a>
a few years ago, but didn't really like it.
GitHub is the the best, no doubts.</p>

<p><br>
<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/187141/yegor256">StackOverflow</a>
is where I learn new technologies, ask questions, answer them sometimes
and really enjoy working with the community. When I have some free time
I just search by
<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/design-patterns">"design-patterns"</a> or
<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/oop">"oop"</a>
tags in order to find relevant questions and answer them if I can.</p>

<p><br>
<a href="http://www.godaddy.com">Godaddy</a> is where I register all domain
names. Their user interface is terrible, but their
prices are the lowest. So, I'm with them for at least eight years already.</p>

<p>
<br>
<a href="http://analytics.google.com">Google Analytics</a>
and <a href="https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/home">Google Webmasters</a>
are two systems where I track
my entire web traffic of all my websites. Both systems are terrible, performance
and interface wise. But since it's Google, we have to stay with them,
to see how they understand web statistics. I'm also using
<a href="https://hit.ua">hit.ua</a>.</p>

<p>
<br>
<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a>
and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/">/r/programming</a> at Reddit
seem to be the best sources of news for me. I open them a few times a week.</p>

<p>
<br>
<a href="http://www.facebook.com">Facebook</a>
and <a href="http://www.twitter.com">Twitter</a>
are the social networks I'm spamming regularly. They are far from being
perfect, but they totally dominate the market.
I was using these guys, but they seem to be dead now:
LinkedIn, Google+.</p>

<p><br>
<a href="http://amzn.to/2ufwBbw">Amazon</a>
is where I buy everything that is not food or clothes.</p>

<p><br>
<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/">AWS</a>
is where I keep all
<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/">my data</a>,
<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/route53/">my DNS</a>,
<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/">my servers</a>,
and some other things. I'm with them since they
launched S3 (in 2006).</p>

<p><br>
<a href="https://contabo.com/">Contabo</a>
is where I host servers, which I need 24x7. Their prices are great
and the service is pretty decent. I'm with them for at least five years.</p>

<p><br>
<a href="https://papertrailapp.com/?thank=9e5dc6">Papertrail</a>
is where all my logs are being aggregated. I tried a few other
systems, but these guys seem to be the best. I even was paying them something
some time ago, but stoppedâ€”their free package seems to be sufficient
enough for my volumes.</p>

<p><br>
<a href="https://www.sentry.io">Sentry</a>
is where all my errors are being sent to, from production systems.</p>

<p><br>
<a href="https://www.buffer.com">Buffer</a>
is helping me to spam Twitter and Facebook more effectively. I pay
them for the premium package and have no regrets. The service really
helps me deliver content to the social networks on schedule.</p>

<p><br>
<a href="http://www.youtube.com">YouTube</a>
is where I keep my video content. I also stream
<a href="/webinars.html">my webinars</a> there.</p>

<p><br>
<a href="http://www.soundcloud.com">SoundCloud</a>
is where I'm listening to music and keep my own channel with
<a href="/shift-m.html">Shift-M</a> podcast and other audio content.</p>

<p><br>
<a href="https://qdc.qbo.intuit.com/qbo30/login">QuickBooks</a>
is where I keep all my bookkeeping accounts, for all my companies.</p>

<p>Did I forget anything?</p>
