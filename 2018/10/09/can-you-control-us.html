According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_%28management%29&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;, it means “setting standards, measuring actual performance and taking &lt;em&gt;corrective action&lt;/em&gt;.” What are the corrective actions in the context of people management? There are two: rewards and punishments. In order to keep even the &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/08/13/strict-code-quality-control.html&quot;&gt;most talented people&lt;/a&gt; under control, we have to reward them for their successes and punish or &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/09/16/how-to-fire-someone-right.html&quot;&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt; them for their failures.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The question is how you do that. How do you reward and how do you punish?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Even if you don’t want to admit that you do it, you still do. You reward and you punish. How does it happen in a traditional management model with the “hired developers” my prospective client was talking about?

We are way smarter than you. We know how to pretend to be working, while doing something else. We know how to create an illusion that we are loyal to the project, while searching the market for a new job. We know how to organize our time such that you only get ten percent of it, if you are lucky.

He texted me today: “[At Zerocracy] there is no commitment and anybody is free to leave any time, so the risk of entrusting a highly important project to such a platform and failing to deliver it on time is very high. We will develop it on our own with hired developers who will have salaries, and I’ll be architect and project manager, that way it will be under our entire control.” I think this word “control” he used deserves a comment.</p><figure class="jb_picture"><img itemprop="image" alt="The Drop (2014) by Michaël R. Roskam" src="/images/2018/10/the-drop.jpg" longdesc="#c9f2bfd5" /><figcaption id="c9f2bfd5">The Drop (2014) by Michaël R. Roskam</figcaption></figure><p>First, I know how much we hate the word “control” when it’s being applied to us sensitive and fragile individuals, also known as computer geeks. We don’t want to be under anyone’s control. We also don’t want to control others. We prefer to think that things just move forward on their own, not because someone stays on top of them and controls them.</p><p>However, this is an illusion.</p><p>We and our projects have to be under control in order for the projects to be completed.</p><p>OK, replace it with managed, organized, or (I love this word) orchestrated.</p><p>The bottom line is: you control it or you lose it.</p><p>What does control technically mean? According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_%28management%29">Wikipedia</a>, it means “setting standards, measuring actual performance and taking <em>corrective action</em>.” What are the corrective actions in the context of people management? There are two: rewards and punishments. In order to keep even the <a href="/2014/08/13/strict-code-quality-control.html">most talented people</a> under control, we have to reward them for their successes and punish or <a href="/2015/09/16/how-to-fire-someone-right.html">fire</a> them for their failures.</p><p>The question is how you do that. How do you reward and how do you punish?</p><p>Even if you don’t want to admit that you do it, you still do. You reward and you punish. How does it happen in a traditional management model with the “hired developers” my prospective client was talking about?
