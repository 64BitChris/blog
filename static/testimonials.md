This is what _some_ of my readers think about me. The list is
sorted by my personal preference, the most interesting comments
are at the top.

"You're a self opinionated asshole and I hope you suffocate
under the weight of your giant ego, you clueless asshole."&mdash;anonymous (by email)

"Yegor you are a professional name-dropper, a talker, not a doer,
so please stop pretending your own dumb mantras, certs, "methodologies" like
"puzzle-driven-development" (seriously?) mean jack-shit because you SUCK
and are constipated with your own opinions. You are the epitome of
what Dijkstra (a doer, unlike you) said was wrong with software development
so go fuck yourself. I understand that you have to promote your business
but goddamn you would probably choke any programmer who worked under
you by dictating what angle they held a bloody pencil at you dip. Please stop"&mdash;anonymous (by email)

"You are great at writing code that is painful to understand, use and explain."&mdash;[Ross W.](http://www.yegor256.com/2015/12/08/temporal-coupling-between-method-calls.html#comment-2401444164)

"The author is the type of person that embodies everything that's
wrong with this industry: hypocritical, holds people to
a standard he doesn't meet, lacks basic empathy and
the ability to put himself in another person's shoes&mdash;some kind
of coward/sociopath hybrid. Would be laughable if it wasn't pathetic."&mdash;[NoOne](http://www.yegor256.com/2015/12/22/why-dont-you-contribute-to-open-source.html#comment-3099486424)

"That may be the most stupid use of object orientation I have ever seen"&mdash;[Tor D.](http://www.yegor256.com/2014/05/05/oop-alternative-to-utility-classes.html#comment-2705418724)

" ... insightless nonsense"&mdash;[@andreasdotorg](https://twitter.com/andreasdotorg/status/756138631325061120)

"I have still a good opinion of you but some posts are just holy crap"&mdash;[Siv N.](http://www.yegor256.com/2015/12/08/temporal-coupling-between-method-calls.html#comment-2423190347)

"A great intellectual masturbator of concepts that never gets his
hands really dirty; in other words a misleader. Go back to your
bedroom and play with your dick."&mdash;[Martin L.](http://www.yegor256.com/2014/12/01/orm-offensive-anti-pattern.html#comment-2601044224)

"If I would be the one to decide what is irresponsible coding
you would be imprisoned for a lifetime by me."&mdash;[David R.](http://www.yegor256.com/2015/11/24/imprisonment-for-irresponsible-coding.html#comment-2376244941)

"You're a smug, pontificating prick."&mdash;anonymous

"You are a moron that probably does not work in any real application ever, and I hope you won't"&mdash;[Peter V.](http://www.yegor256.com/2014/12/01/orm-offensive-anti-pattern.html#comment-2854491117)

"Are you an idiot?"&mdash;[Asshat](http://www.yegor256.com/2014/10/29/how-much-do-you-cost.html#comment-1871518471)

"Probably the biggest pile of stinky cow shit I have ever read"&mdash;[@migrrrr](https://twitter.com/migrrrr/status/771689354913873920)

"You're a sociopath."&mdash;[Odain](http://www.yegor256.com/2014/10/12/who-is-software-architect.html#comment-2359146551)

"I quickly lost interest in your blog because you clearly are a dick."&mdash;[Philippe](http://www.yegor256.com/2014/10/29/how-much-do-you-cost.html#comment-1697848370)
