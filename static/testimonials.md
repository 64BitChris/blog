This is what my readers think about me. If you want to add
something, just [email me](mailto:me@yegor256.com).

"I have still a good opinion of you but some posts are just holy crap"
&mdash; Siv N.

"You're a self opinionated asshole and I hope you suffocate
under the weight of your giant ego, you clueless asshole."
&mdash; anonymous

"You are great at writing code that
is painful to understand, use and explain."
&mdash; Ross W.

"If I would be the one to decide what is irresponsible coding
you would be imprisoned for a lifetime by me."
&mdash; David R.

"A great intellectual masturbator of concepts that never gets his
hands really dirty; in other words - a misleader. Go back to your
bedroom and play with your dick."
&mdash; Martin L.
