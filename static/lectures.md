I can visit your office with a lecture about object-oriented
programming, project management, DevOps or software engineering
in general. And it's **free**!

Just pick any post on the blog and I will make a one-hour lecture about it,
right in your office. The lecture itself will take 30 minutes.
Then, we will spend another 30 minutes for Q&A.

The only thing you must pay for is **professional** video recording
and photo shooting (two video operators, one photographer, standalone
sound recording, editing afterwards).
Depending on the location, this will cost you somewhere
around $200-500. The lecture will be published on
[my YouTube channel](http://www.youtube.com/user/technoparkcorp), to
give everybody an ability to watch it too.

If your office is where I stay currently (I travel very often,
in the United States, Western and Eastern Europe), there will be
no travel involved. Otherwise, I will also ask you to reimburse travel
expenses. But, it's better just to synchronize your schedule with my
travel plans.

Interested? [Email me](mailto:lecture@yegor256.com).
