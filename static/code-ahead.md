"Code Ahead" will be my second book. It will be about software engineering. It
will contain a number of best practices, which help software live longer.
All of that principles I've learned from my practical experience. It will
be published in February, 2017.

Aug 15, 2016:
I finally found the right name for this book: "Code Ahead". It is derived
from "think ahead", with a focus on code and coders. The book will
explain what I think has to be done in any software project to make
the lifetime of the software longer.
