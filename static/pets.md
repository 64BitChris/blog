It's a full list of my pet projects (which are still alive). If interested
in helping any of them, don't hesitate to [email](mailto:pets@yegor256.com).
Also, there are a number of projects, which I haven't fully started yet,
because I don't have enough time. If you're a Java or Ruby programmer, I'd be
interested to discuss a co-founding opportunity for you: I will pay for
all project expenses and you will write software. We will be co-founders.
[Email me](mailto:cofounder@yegor256.com).
