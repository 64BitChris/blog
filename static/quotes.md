Here is a more or less complete list of my favorite quotes.

&mdash;
"There is nothing of which we are more certain
than the feeling of our self, of our own ego."
[Sigmund Freud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmund_Freud),
[Civilization and its Discontents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilization_and_Its_Discontents), 1930.

&mdash;
"What is good? &mdash; All that heightens the feeling of power, the
will to power, power itself in man. What is bad? &mdash; All
that proceeds from weakness. What is happiness? &mdash;
The feeling that power increases &mdash; that a resistance is overcome."
[Friedrich Nietzsche](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Nietzsche),
[The Antichrist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Antichrist_%28book%29)
