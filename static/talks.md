This is where I'll be talking soon.
I'm updating this list very often, but still,
follow me [on Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/yegor256) and [on Lanyrd](http://lanyrd.com/profile/yegor256/)
for the most recent news.
Below is a list of all venues I've been talking at with my short
summary of their quality. Well, not just a summary, but an evaluation.
Not every conference is as good as some others. That's why I decided to
give them some feedback, at least here (see below).

It was an interesting event, mostly because the audience was full
of questions and really interested in project management. The location, the
food, logistics, etc. were good enough. I didn't really like the content
other speakers were delivering. I suspect that most of them were invited
there because of their names.

There were about 250 people. The location was not good at all &mdash;
it was a cinema. Also, the audience was so serious or so shy that it
was rather difficult to present. Not just for me. Also, I got an impression
that speakers were invited just because of their names, not the content they
deliver. Aside from that, the impression was positive.

It was a very big (over 1200 people) and a very well organized
Java conference. The food, the location, the logistics, everything. My
presentation was carefully screened beforehand by the organizers and I received a few
valuable corrections. The content, I would say, was not so perfect. I would
recommend to look at new names in the industry and invite those who are less
known but working on something hot and interesting. Besides that, the event
was perfect.

It was one of the best conferences I've attended so far. A very well organized,
carefully planned, in a perfect and rather expensive location. Besides that,
my speech was screened beforehand. I even had to make it over Skype and some
corrections were received. What I would suggest to invite new speakers &mdash;
it seems that there are almost the same faces every year.

It was a huge event with, I guess, over 1500 attendees. Even on my presentation
there were over 150 people in the room. The location, the food, the logistics &mdash;
everything was good. The only negative part is a total disfocus of the
content. Speakers were talking just about everything. I didn't even understand
why my presentation was accepted there :)

The event was free-to-enter, but very well organized. The location was
comfortable, the audience motivated enough and the organizers really
cared about the event. The only bad thing was a total absence of speakers
screening. Nobody checked my presentation before and I can only assume
that the same happened to other speakers.

The conference was rather small, but well focused. The audience was actively
engaged and asked a lot of questions. About a hundred people at my talk.
The quality of the location was average and my expenses
were not reimbursed. Also, the content was not really well-prepared or monitored.

There were over 250 people and just two main tracks &mdash; good setup.
A comfortable location, careful organization, good food, expenses
paid. The only problem was the content. Most presentations
were rather boring and not well prepared. Aside from that, I liked it.

The place was good, the food was very good, the organization was not bad, but
the audience was rather old and out-of-subject. Maybe system engineering is
not really my thing, but most of these guys live somewhere in 1990. And there
were less than a hundred people for four tracks. Just about twenty per
presentation. It's not really a conference, but more like a meetup.

It's a very small conference, with barely ten (!) people in the room. The
talks were separated in six rooms, with no specific focus on subjects. Moreover,
I don't think they did any prepareation of speakers or even selection of them.
Clearly, the event was there only to make money. The only thing I enjoyed
was the city, one of my favorites, &mdash; Seattle. Aside from that, it was
a time wasting event for me.

Looks like these DataRobot (the sponsor of the event) guys
care about quality and do this with passion. There were about 180 people at
my speech and the reaction of the audience was rather active. What this event can improve
is to pay attention to the preparation of speakers and limiting their number
to just four. They had too many (six) and most of the talks were rather boring, overloaded
with text-rich slides. Also, the place should definitely be changed, NSC Olimpiyskiy
is just a trash. To be honest, there previous event in Fedoriv Hub was much better
(I would give it an "A").

This was a shame for the entire industry &mdash; money making event with
zero attention to quality. Just random speakers, random attendees, random
subjects &mdash; just anything that will help them make money on selling
tickets.

That was a huge event with, I would say, over 2000 participants and almost
zero efforts from organizers to make it interesting. Talks were mostly
from sponsors, promoting their own products, or from clowns making
living by talking about "why writing clean code is important".
Needless to say that they didn't
compensate travel expenses of speakers, while making a lot of money
on tickets. It was a waste of time and money.

There were about 50 people in the room, most of whom were rather
interested and engaged. The place was comfortable, equipment was of
good quality, the focus was right on my talk, since I was the only presenter.
I've got a number of leads from this event.

The event was rather big, over 300 people in the room. However, the audience
was rather passive and presentations were mostly from sponsors. The event was there
mostly to make money, which is always a downside. The location was rather
bad &mdash; an old Soviet-time hotel.

The place was a total trash (small rooms in NSC Olimpiyskiy) with bad light,
bad sound and lack of proper ventilation. There was no preparation of talks
or any communication with speakers. These guys are just making money
in a hype market. It's a shame.

There were less than a hundred people in total, separated by, I guess, four rooms.
A rather small event, but participants were active. Agile is in general
a very boring subject, maybe that's why the event was also rather slow, despite
all the attempts of organizers to make it fun.
