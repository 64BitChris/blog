"256 Bloghacks" is a book about blogging. It says everything
I can say about my blogging experience here, at this blog. I put
all my numbers there, all stats and all secrets. It is a collection
of hints, hacks, ideas, and recommendations. Hopefully it will help
young bloggers to achieve some success, at least initially. My blog
is not really big, but it gets 60,000 unique monthly visitors now
and keeps growing. You will definitely learn something new from this
book.
