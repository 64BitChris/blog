If you find my ideas interesting, and want to get deeper into them,
we may organize an on-site tranining for your team. There are three
topics I'm training for: object-oriented programming, DevOps, and
project management.

Usually, it's a one full-day **6-hours** course, split into two parts by
three hours each. There could be from four to sixteen people in the room.

The cost: **$500/hour** (plus travel and accomodation expenses).

As a bonus, all course participants get a copy
of one of [my books](/books.html).

Text me in [Telegram](https://t.me/yegor256) or [email](mailto:trainings@yegor256.com) when ready.
