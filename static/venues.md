This is a very opinionated and subjective list of conferences,
which I [attented recently](/talks.html), as a speaker. They rate us speakers,
why shouldn't we rate them, right? It's a rated list, where the best places
I've seen so far are at the bot and the worst are at the bottom. The best
rate is **A+**, while the worst is **F**.

Looks like these DataRobot (the sponsor of the event) guys
care about quality and do this with passion. There were about 180 people at
my speech and audience reaction was rather active. What this event can improve
is to pay attention to the preparation of speakers and limiting their number
to just four. They had too many and most of talks were rather boring, overloaded
with text-rich slides. Also, the place should definitely changed, NSC Olimpiyskiy
is just a trash.
