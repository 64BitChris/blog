This is a very opinionated and subjective list of conferences,
which I [attented recently](/talks.html), as a speaker. They rate us speakers,
why shouldn't we rate them, right? It's a rated list, where the best places
I've seen so far are at the bot and the worst are at the bottom. The best
rate is <span class="green">**A+**</span>, while the worst is
<span class="red">**F-**</span>.

[The Entrepreneurs' Club](https://www.facebook.com/events/166135913758018/); 11 February 2016; Palo Alto, USA<br/>
There were about 50 people in the room, most of whom were rather
interested and engaged. The place was comfortable, equipment was of
good quality, the focus was right on my talk, since I was the only presenter.
I've got a number of leads from this event.

[Kyiv DevOps Day](https://www.facebook.com/events/1492540384386929/); 27 February 2016; Kyiv, Ukraine<br/>
Looks like these DataRobot (the sponsor of the event) guys
care about quality and do this with passion. There were about 180 people at
my speech and the reaction of the audience was rather active. What this event can improve
is to pay attention to the preparation of speakers and limiting their number
to just four. They had too many (six) and most of the talks were rather boring, overloaded
with text-rich slides. Also, the place should definitely be changed, NSC Olimpiyskiy
is just a trash. To be honest, there previous event in Fedoriv Hub was much better
(I would give it an "A").

[DevOpsDays Warsaw 2015](http://devopsdays.pl/); 25 November 2015; Warsaw, Poland<br/>
The event was rather big, over 300 people in the room. However, the audience
was rather passive and presentations were mostly from sponsors. The event was there
mostly to make money, which is always a downside. The location was rather
bad &mdash; an old Soviet-time hotel.

[Distributed Agile Teams, Flock 2015](http://distributed-agile-teams.org/workshops/); 20 November 2015; Berlin, Germany<br/>
There were less than a hundred people in total, separated by, I guess, four rooms.
A rather small event, but participants were active. Agile is in general
a very boring subject, maybe that's why the event was also rather slow, despite
all the attempts of organizers to make it fun.

[BuildStuff 2015](http://buildstuff.com.ua/); 23 November 2015; Kyiv, Ukraine<br/>
The place was a total trash (small rooms in NSC Olimpiyskiy) with bad light,
bad sound and lack of proper ventilation. There was no preparation of talks
or any communication with speakers. These guys are just making money
in a hype market. It's a shame.

[DevNexus 2016](https://www.devnexus.com/s/speakers#Yegor_Bugayenko); 16 February 2016; Atlanta, USA<br/>
That was a huge event with, I would say, over 2000 participants and almost
zero efforts from organizers to make it interesting. Talks were mostly
from sponsors, promoting their own products, or from clowns making
living by talking about "why writing clean code is important".
Needless to say that they didn't
compensate travel expenses of speakers, while making a lot of money
on tickets. It was a waste of time and money.

[DeveloperWeek 2016](http://www.developerweek.com/); 17 February 2016; San Francisco, USA<br/>
This was a shame for the entire industry &mdash; money making event with
zero attention to quality. Just random speakers, random attendees, random
subjects &mdash; just anything that will help them make money on selling
tickets.

[CascadiaIT](http://casitconf.org/casitconf16/talks/); 12 March 2016; Seattle, USA<br/>
It's a very small conference, with barely ten (!) people in the room. The
talks were separated in six rooms, with no specific focus on subjects. Moreover,
I don't think they did any prepareation of speakers or even selection of them.
Clearly, the event was there only to make money. The only thing I enjoyed
was the city, one of my favorites, &mdash; Seattle. Aside from that, it was
a time wasting event for me.
