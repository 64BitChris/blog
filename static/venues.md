This is a very opinionated and subjective list of conferences,
which I [attented recently](/talks.html), as a speaker. They rate us speakers,
why shouldn't we rate them, right? It's a rated list, where the best places
I've seen so far are at the bot and the worst are at the bottom. The best
rate is **A+**, while the worst is **F**.
