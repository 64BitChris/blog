[Elegant Objects](/elegant-objects.html) (Volume 1)
is my first book. It is about object-oriented
programming, from an idealistic and, maybe, a bit futuristic
point of view. There are 23 independent recommendations for
a practical OOP designer on how to make code cleaner, classes
more solid and architecture more visible.

[256 Bloghacks](/256-bloghacks.html) is a book about blogging,
disclosing all techniques, secrets and tactics I'm using at this blog.
It contains many small and big recommendations,
which I would be glad to hear when I started blogging. Unfortunately,
I didn't have that book back then. You have a chance to learn everything
in just one go.
