[Elegant Objects](/elegant-objects.html) (Volume 1)
is my first book. It is about object-oriented
programming, from an idealistic and, maybe, a bit futuristic
point of view. There are 23 independent recommendations for
a practical OOP designer on how to make code cleaner, classes
more solid and architecture more visible.
Published: 22 Feb 2016. I'm writing the **second volume** now,
which is going to be published before the end of 2016.
