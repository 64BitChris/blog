"Elegant Objects" is my first book. It is about object-oriented
programming, from an idealistic and, maybe, a bit futuristic
point of view. There are 23 independent recommendations for
a practical OOP designer on how to make code cleaner, classes
more solid and architecture more visible.
To be published: 22 Feb 2016.

"Elegant Mangement" is the second book. It will be about project
management, just management, leadership, awards, punishments,
philosophy, life, love, hate, motivation, idiots, and pain. Everything
that basically is a modern management.
To be published: end of 2016.
