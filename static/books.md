[Elegant Objects](/elegant-objects.html) (Volume 1)
is my first book. It is about object-oriented
programming, from an idealistic and, maybe, a bit futuristic
point of view. There are 23 independent recommendations for
a practical OOP designer on how to make code cleaner, classes
more solid and architecture more visible.

[256 Bloghacks](/256-bloghacks.html) is a book about blogging,
disclosing all techniques, secrets and tactics I'm using at this blog.
It contains many small and big recommendations,
which I would be glad to hear when I started blogging. Unfortunately,
I didn't have that book back then. You have a chance to learn everything
in just one go.

## How to Get a Discount

All books have the same price of $40.96 (plus shipment from Amazon).
You have a few options if you want to get them cheaper than that:

  * Attend a conference where I'm speaking. In most cases I have a few
    books with me. If I don't, you just [email me](mailto:shop@yegor256.com) later and attach
    a photo of your conference badge. The price in that case will be **$20.00** plus
    shipment, which in most cases is $7.00.

  * You can buy a book for its full price on Amazon and then
    write a blog post _and_ an Amazon review (both honest, not
    necessarily positive). I will send you back $32.00 (via PayPal or check).
    Thus, the final cost of the book will be somewhere around **$12.00**.

  * If you're a student, find seven other friends and you will
    get a **student package** of 8 books for $64.00 plus shippment.
    Thus, you will get each book for **$8.00**. I will need you to confirm
    that all of you guys really are students though.

Pay attention that all books are sold at
[Amazon.com](https://www.amazon.com/Yegor-Bugayenko/e/B01AM1QMDK/),
[Amazon.co.uk](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Yegor-Bugayenko/e/B01AM1QMDK/),
[Amazon.de](https://www.amazon.de/Yegor-Bugayenko/e/B01AM1QMDK/),
and
[Amazon.jp](https://www.amazon.co.jp/Yegor-Bugayenko/e/B01AM1QMDK/).
Choose the one that is the closest to you distance wise.
Keep in mind that I sell [only]({% pst 2016/nov/2016-11-09-why-no-ebooks %})
printed books, no digital ones.
