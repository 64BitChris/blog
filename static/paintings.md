This is the full list of my paintings, which are for sale. You can buy
anyone, paying via PayPal (you will also have to pay for shipment,
via FedEx). What is important is that
every dollar you pay will be turned into prize money in my annual
[Software Quality Award](/award.html). Thus, you will get a piece
of art _and_ will help the software industry to become better.
[Email me](mailto:paintings@yegor256.com) if interested.

You can also buy via [Saatchi Art](https://www.saatchiart.com/yegor256).

my sadness, and my colors. Now it's time to start looking for a new one."
