This is the full list of my paintings, which are for sale. You can buy
anyone, paying via PayPal. Shipment via FedEx is on me. Every dollar
you pay will be turned into prize money in my annual
[Software Quality Award](/award.html). Thus, you will get a piece
of art _and_ will help the software industry to become better.

You can also buy via [Saatchi Art](https://www.saatchiart.com/yegor256).
