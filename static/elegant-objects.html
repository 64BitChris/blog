<p>"Elegant Objects" is my first book. It is about object-oriented programming, from an idealistic and, maybe, a bit futuristic point of view. There are 23 independent recommendations for a practical OOP designer on how to make code cleaner, classes more solid and architure more visible.</p><p>Nov 22, 2015: The book is ready in its first draft, version <strong>0.1</strong>. I invite you to become its first reviewer. Send me an <a href="mailto:book@yegor256.com">email</a> with a short description about yourself (I will select 5-8 reviewers). Then, I will send you a book. It's free and I will pay for shipping. You will read it (200 pages), and make your corrections right inside the book. Then, ship it back to me using UPS <a href="https://www.ups.com/content/us/en/shipping/time/service/value_added/cod.html">collect on delivery</a>. Your name will be in the book, on the first page, in the list of <strong>acknowledgements</strong>!</p><p>I'm interested in your negative feedback mostly. Tell me what is not clear, what is missing, what needs a more detailed explanation. But, please, <strong>don't argue</strong> with my ideas. I won't change them, based on your review. For example, if I'm saying that a static method is a bad thing and you disagree, don't try to convince me, it won't help :) This is my opinion and this is what the book is about. However, I'm sure that my <strong>explanations</strong> and <strong>arguments</strong> have many flaws. As an early reviewer, you will help me to find them. Again, don't argue with <strong>what</strong> I'm preaching, but complain about <strong>how</strong> I do it.</p>
