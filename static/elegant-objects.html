<p>&quot;Elegant Objects&quot; is my first book. It is about object-oriented
programming, from an idealistic and, maybe, a bit futuristic
point of view. There are 23 independent recommendations for
a practical OOP designer on how to make code cleaner, classes
more solid and architecture more visible. It is available for sale
on <a href="http://goo.gl/W2WVMk">Amazon</a> (please, don&#39;t forget to review it there!),
ISBN: 1519166915.<br/>

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/books/4013/ref=pd_zg_hrsr_b_1_5_last">Object-Oriented Design</a> category!

Over a 100 books sold already, in just one week! I&#39;m glad to see
that you&#39;re interested in reading it. I haven&#39;t got a single review yet,
but I&#39;m sure there will be some. I would like to ask you to post your
reviews, either negative or positive, directly to
<a href="http://goo.gl/W2WVMk">Amazon</a>.
I&#39;m getting many requests about an <strong>electronic version</strong> of the book.
I&#39;m not planning to turn this into an e-book, at least until the end
of 2018. Mostly because I&#39;m greedy. I realize that the moment I publish
a Kindle version, it will be available for a free download somewhere.
Although, some of you are saying that the &quot;dead tree&quot; format is not
convenient, since it takes too much space, etc. Here is the the offer.
You buy a paper book now, read it, make a picture of it,
and throw it away, so that it doesn&#39;t take space. When an e-book is available,
send me that picture and I will send you a Kindle/epub/PDF/whatever
file <strong>for free</strong>. How does this sound?</p>

The book is published! It is for sale,
<a href="http://goo.gl/W2WVMk">on Amazon</a>.
The price is $40.96. The size is 229 pages. The paper is creamy.
The cover is mate. I took into account recommendations and corrections
of 9 reviewers. Two of them were missed, for technical reasons. I will
definitely include them in the next edition. If you decide to buy it,
please leave your feedback
<a href="http://goo.gl/W2WVMk">on Amazon</a>.
It will help me attract more readers. After reading, please shoot me
an email to <a href="mailto:book@yegor256.com">book@yegor256.com</a>.
I&#39;m very interested to know what you think. Thanks!</p>

This cute cactus, created by <a href="http://andreeamironiuc.com/">Andreea Mironiuc</a>,
will be on the cover of the book. For a number of reasons. First,
because it&#39;s elegant. Isn&#39;t it? Second, it&#39;s alive, just like
all our objects in Java. Right? Third, it&#39;s pretty hard to offend by
breaking its skin and treating it as a bag for other objects. And forth,
I just like it.</p>

Almost all reviewers have finished already. I&#39;m waiting for the
last two to send me their results and will start making
final changes. Fortunately, the overall feedback is <strong>positive</strong>
so far. All reviewers said that the book was worth reading.

By the way, their names are (in alphabetic order):

I&#39;ve received <strong>63 emails</strong> so far and it&#39;s time to choose the best candidates.
I will do it in the next few days and will email them. I will announce
the names of selected reviewers here, soon. Thanks a lot to all of you,
for your readiness to help!</p>

<p>Nov 22, 2015:
The book is ready in its first draft, version <strong>0.1</strong>.
I invite you to become its first reviewer. Send me
an <a href="mailto:book@yegor256.com">email</a> with a short description about yourself.
I will select a few reviewers (8 is the number I have in mind now).
Then, I will send you a book. It&#39;s free and I will
pay for shipping. You will read it (200 pages), and make your corrections
right inside the book. Then, ship it back to me using
UPS <a href="https://www.ups.com/content/us/en/shipping/time/service/value_added/cod.html">collect on delivery</a>.
Your name will be in the book, on the 9th page,
in the list of <strong>acknowledgements</strong>!
I&#39;m interested in your negative feedback mostly.
Tell me what is not clear, what is missing, what needs a more detailed
explanation. But, please, <strong>don&#39;t argue</strong> with my ideas. I won&#39;t change
them, based on your review. For example, if I&#39;m saying that a
static method is a bad thing and you disagree, don&#39;t try to
convince me, it won&#39;t help :) This is my opinion and this is what the
book is about. However, I&#39;m sure that my <strong>explanations</strong> and <strong>arguments</strong>
have many flaws. As an early reviewer, you will help me find them.
Again, don&#39;t argue with <strong>what</strong> I&#39;m preaching, but complain about <strong>how</strong> I do it.</p>

The manuscript is finished, in its first draft. Took about 200 hours. Most
