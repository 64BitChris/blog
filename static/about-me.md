I'm Yegor Bugayenko (Russian:
<span lang="ru" xml:lang="ru">Ег&#x43E;&#x301;р Буга&#x435;&#x301;нко</span>),
a programmer, a founder, an investor, and a philanthropist.

As a **programmer** I [write](https://github.com/yegor256)
mostly in Java, but also in Ruby, PHP and JavaScript.
I'm a founder and a lead architect of
[takes.org](http://www.takes.org) and [rultor.com](http://www.rultor.com). I'm using
IntelliJ products (my [settings.jar](http://img.teamed.io/settings.jar) for Java).
Here are [my favorite books]({% pst 2015/apr/2015-04-22-favorite-software-books %})
about software engineering.
I'm an Oracle Certified Master, Java EE 6 Enterprise Architect
([OCMEA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Certified_Enterprise_Architect)).
Besides that, I'm a proud holder of
[ZCE](http://www.zend.com/en/yellow-pages/ZEND007965),
[ZFCE](http://www.zend.com/en/yellow-pages/ZEND007965), and
[OCUP](http://www.omg.org/uml-certification/).
I also wrote a book about object-oriented programming,
called [Elegant Objects](/elegant-objects.html) (and
[a few other books](/books.html)).

As a **founder** and CEO at [Zerocracy](http://www.zerocracy.com/),
a software engineering and management platform with an absolutely unique
methodology called [XDSD](http://www.xdsd.org),
I'm an author of a few patent applications, including
[Puzzle Driven Development (PDD) Method and Software](https://www.google.com/patents/US20120023476)
and
[Method for Software Cost Estimating Using Scope Champions](https://www.google.com/patents/US20100042968).
I'm a certified Project Management Professional
([PMP&reg;](http://www.pmi.org/Certification/Project-Management-Professional-PMP.aspx)).
Besides that, I'm a proud holder of
[RUP](http://www-03.ibm.com/certify/certs/38008003.shtml),
[PRINCE2 Foundation](https://www.prince2.com/usa),
[MCP](https://www.mcpvirtualbusinesscard.com/Profile.aspx?ID=df72ca54-8fc9-439a-870c-1b938bd762cf) and
[COSMIC](http://www.cosmicon.com/certificateHoldersV3.asp) certificates.

As an **investor** at [SeedRamp.com](http://www.seedramp.com) I have
made a few investments, but have got no results yet :)

As a **philanthropist** I donate a few thousand dollars every year (started in 2015)
to the best open source project, which I pick myself out of about a hundred in
a more or less fair [competition](/award.html).

Once a month I send a summary email of my writing activity. If
you're interested to know what's going on here, I can add you to my
mailing list. Just give me your email address and briefly explain who you are
and why you're interested (I'm trying to avoid anonymous
subscribers).

By the way, this is what some people think about me
and this blog: [testimonials](/testimonials.html) (be careful!).

Ah, one more thing. I'm a big fan of good movies, here is
[my list]({% pst 2014/apr/2014-04-06-movies-for-thanasis %}),
I  would recommend you to watch.
