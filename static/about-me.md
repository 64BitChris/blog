I'm Yegor Bugayenko (Russian:
<span lang="ru" xml:lang="ru">Ег&#x43E;&#x301;р Буга&#x435;&#x301;нко</span>),
a programmer, founder, investor, and philanthropist.

As a **programmer**, I [write](https://github.com/yegor256)
mostly in Java, but also in Ruby, PHP, and JavaScript.
I'm the founder and lead architect of
[Cactoos](http://www.cactoos.org),
[Takes](http://www.takes.org), and [Rultor](http://www.rultor.com).
Here are [my favorite books]({% pst 2015/apr/2015-04-22-favorite-software-books %})
about software engineering, and a detailed description of
[my work environment]({% pst 2017/jun/2017-06-27-my-environment %}).
I'm an Oracle Certified Master and Java EE 6 Enterprise Architect
([OCMEA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Certified_Enterprise_Architect)).
Besides that, I'm a proud holder of
[ZCE](http://www.zend.com/en/yellow-pages/ZEND007965),
[ZFCE](http://www.zend.com/en/yellow-pages/ZEND007965), and
[OCUP](http://www.omg.org/uml-certification/) certifications.
I've also written a book series about object-oriented programming,
called [Elegant Objects](/elegant-objects.html), plus
[a few other books](/books.html).

As a **founder** and CEO of [Zerocracy](http://www.zerocracy.com/),
a software engineering and management platform with an absolutely unique
methodology called [XDSD](http://www.xdsd.org),
I'm the author of a few patent applications, including
[Puzzle-Driven Development (PDD) Method and Software](https://www.google.com/patents/US20120023476)
and
[Method for Software Cost Estimating Using Scope Champions](https://www.google.com/patents/US20100042968).
I'm a certified Project Management Professional
([PMP&reg;](http://www.pmi.org/Certification/Project-Management-Professional-PMP.aspx)).
Besides that, I'm a proud holder of
[RUP](http://www-03.ibm.com/certify/certs/38008003.shtml),
[PRINCE2 Foundation](https://www.prince2.com/usa),
[MCP](https://www.mcpvirtualbusinesscard.com/Profile.aspx?ID=df72ca54-8fc9-439a-870c-1b938bd762cf),
and
[COSMIC](http://www.cosmicon.com/certificateHoldersV3.asp) certificates.

As an **investor** at [SeedRamp.com](http://www.seedramp.com), I've
made a few investments, but I've got no results yet :)

As a **philanthropist**, I donate a few thousand dollars every year (started in 2015)
to the best open-source project at the time, which I pick myself out of about a hundred in
a more or less fair [competition](/award.html).

Once a month, I send a summary email of my writing activity. If
you're interested in knowing what's going on here, I can add you to my
mailing list. Just give me your email address and briefly explain who you are
and why you're interested (I'm trying to avoid anonymous
subscribers).

Ah, one more thing. I'm a big fan of good movies, so here's

I would recommend you watch. Also, here is my list of favorite
