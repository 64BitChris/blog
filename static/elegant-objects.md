"Elegant Objects" is my first book. It is about object-oriented
programming, from an idealistic and, maybe, a bit futuristic
point of view. There are 23 independent recommendations for
a practical OOP designer on how to make code cleaner, classes
more solid and architecture more visible.

The book is ready in its first draft, version **0.1**.
I invite you to become its first reviewer. Send me
an [email](mailto:book@yegor256.com) with a short description about yourself (I will select
5-8 reviewers). Then, I will send you a book. It's free and I will
pay for shipping. You will read it (200 pages), and make your corrections
right inside the book. Then, ship it back to me using
UPS [collect on delivery](https://www.ups.com/content/us/en/shipping/time/service/value_added/cod.html).
Your name will be in the book, on the first page,
in the list of **acknowledgements**!

I'm interested in your negative feedback mostly.
Tell me what is not clear, what is missing, what needs a more detailed
explanation. But, please, **don't argue** with my ideas. I won't change
them, based on your review. For example, if I'm saying that a
static method is a bad thing and you disagree, don't try to
convince me, it won't help :) This is my opinion and this is what the
book is about. However, I'm sure that my **explanations** and **arguments**
have many flaws. As an early reviewer, you will help me to find them.
Again, don't argue with **what** I'm preaching, but complain about **how** I do it.
