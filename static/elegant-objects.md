"Elegant Objects" is my first book. It is about object-oriented
programming, from an idealistic and, maybe, a bit futuristic
point of view. There are 23 independent recommendations for
a practical OOP designer on how to make code cleaner, classes
more solid and architecture more visible.

This cute cactus, created by [Andreea Mironiuc](http://andreeamironiuc.com/),
will be on the cover of the book. For a number of reasons. First,
because it's elegant. Isn't it? Second, it's alive, just like
all our objects in Java. Right? Third, it's pretty hard to offend by
breaking its skin and treating it as a bag for other objects. And forth,
I just like it.

Almost all reviewers have finished already. I'm waiting for the
last two to send me their results and will start making
final changes. Fortunately, the overall feedback is **positive**
so far. All reviewers said that the book was worth reading.
Here is its [contents](/images/books/elegant-objects/contents.pdf), by the way.

covers the subject I haven't discussed on the blog yet.
This is not exactly the text you will see in the book. This is the
text my selected **11 reviewers** received this week from me by mail.
By the way, their names are (in alphabetic order):

and they book will go out at the end of February.

I've received **63 emails** so far and it's time to choose the best candidates.
I will do it in the next few days and will email them. I will announce
the names of selected reviewers here, soon. Thanks a lot to all of you,
for your readiness to help!

The book is ready in its first draft, version **0.1**.
I invite you to become its first reviewer. Send me
an [email](mailto:book@yegor256.com) with a short description about yourself.
I will select a few reviewers (8 is the number I have in mind now).
Then, I will send you a book. It's free and I will
pay for shipping. You will read it (200 pages), and make your corrections
right inside the book. Then, ship it back to me using
UPS [collect on delivery](https://www.ups.com/content/us/en/shipping/time/service/value_added/cod.html).
Your name will be in the book, on the 9th page,
in the list of **acknowledgements**!

I'm interested in your negative feedback mostly.
Tell me what is not clear, what is missing, what needs a more detailed
explanation. But, please, **don't argue** with my ideas. I won't change
them, based on your review. For example, if I'm saying that a
static method is a bad thing and you disagree, don't try to
convince me, it won't help :) This is my opinion and this is what the
book is about. However, I'm sure that my **explanations** and **arguments**
have many flaws. As an early reviewer, you will help me find them.
Again, don't argue with **what** I'm preaching, but complain about **how** I do it.
