"Elegant Objects" is my first book. It is about object-oriented
programming, from an idealistic and, maybe, a bit futuristic
point of view. There are 23 independent recommendations for
a practical OOP designer on how to make code cleaner, classes
more solid and architecture more visible. It is available for sale
on [Amazon](http://goo.gl/W2WVMk) (please, don't forget to review it there!),
ISBN: 1519166915.<br/>

where we will discuss object-oriented
programming and find out what would be appropriate to write about,
on this blog and in the next volume of the book. Join the chat and stay

interested to be a reviewer, please send me an [email](mailto:book@yegor256.com)

The book just made it into the **top 100 Amazon Best Sellers** in
[Object-Oriented Design](http://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/books/4013/ref=pd_zg_hrsr_b_1_5_last) category!
There are [three reviews](http://goo.gl/W2WVMk)
already. Many thanks to their authors! Would
be great if you publish yours&mdash;this will greatly help
in promoting the manuscript. Besides that, I will be presenting the
book at the following conferences in the next few months:
[JPoint](http://javapoint.ru/en/) in Moscow, April 22;
[JETConf](http://jetconf.by/#/yegor_bugayenko) in Minsk, April 25;
[GeeCON](http://2016.geecon.org/) in Krakow, May 11;
[DEVit](http://devitconf.org/) in Thessaloniki, May 20;
[JEEConf](http://jeeconf.com/speaker/yegor-bugayenko/) in Kiev, May 21.
I will give away a few copies at each event, to those who
ask the most interesting questions after my presentations. Don't miss your
chance to say hello and get a free book.

Over a 100 books sold already, in just one week! I'm glad to see
that you're interested in reading it. I haven't got a single review yet,
but I'm sure there will be some. I would like to ask you to post your
reviews, either negative or positive, directly to
[Amazon](http://goo.gl/W2WVMk).
I'm getting many requests about an **electronic version** of the book.
I'm not planning to turn this into an e-book, at least until the end
of 2018. Mostly because I'm greedy. I realize that the moment I publish
a Kindle version, it will be available for a free download somewhere.
Although, some of you are saying that the "dead tree" format is not
convenient, since it takes too much space, etc. Here is the the offer.
You buy a paper book now, read it, make a picture of it,
and throw it away, so that it doesn't take space. When an e-book is available,
send me that picture and I will send you a Kindle/epub/PDF/whatever
file **for free**. How does this sound?

The book is published! It is for sale,
[on Amazon](http://goo.gl/W2WVMk).
The price is $40.96. The size is 229 pages. The paper is creamy.
The cover is mate. I took into account recommendations and corrections
of 9 reviewers. Two of them were missed, for technical reasons. I will
definitely include them in the next edition. If you decide to buy it,
please leave your feedback
[on Amazon](http://goo.gl/W2WVMk).
It will help me attract more readers. After reading, please shoot me
an email to [book@yegor256.com](mailto:book@yegor256.com).
I'm very interested to know what you think. Thanks!

This cute cactus, created by [Andreea Mironiuc](http://andreeamironiuc.com/),
will be on the cover of the book. For a number of reasons. First,
because it's elegant. Isn't it? Second, it's alive, just like
all our objects in Java. Right? Third, it's pretty hard to offend by
breaking its skin and treating it as a bag for other objects. And forth,
I just like it.

Almost all reviewers have finished already. I'm waiting for the
last two to send me their results and will start making
final changes. Fortunately, the overall feedback is **positive**
so far. All reviewers said that the book was worth reading.
Here is its [contents](/images/books/elegant-objects/contents.pdf), by the way.

Here is a small Christmas gift for those who are interested
in the book&mdash;[**seven pages** from chapter 2.4](/images/books/elegant-objects/seven-pages.pdf), which
covers the subject I haven't discussed on the blog yet.
This is not exactly the text you will see in the book. This is the
text my selected **11 reviewers** received this week from me by mail.
By the way, their names are (in alphabetic order):
[Andrei Istomin](http://www.linkedin.com/in/andrej-istomin-51ba7530),
[Aneesh Dogra](http://in.linkedin.com/in/aneeshdogra),
[Francesco Bianchi](http://ie.linkedin.com/in/francesco-bianchi-4b49784),
[Ion Bordian](http://dk.linkedin.com/in/ion-bordian-06701a88),
[Kanstantsin Kamkou](http://de.linkedin.com/in/kkamkou/en),
[Michal Švec](http://cz.linkedin.com/in/michal-švec-77065711),
[Nicos Kekchidis](http://www.linkedin.com/in/nicoskek),
[Philip Buuck](http://www.linkedin.com/in/philipbuuck),
[Simon Tsai](http://www.linkedin.com/in/simonjtsai),
[Thanasis Papapanagiotou](http://nl.linkedin.com/in/thanpa),
and [Xiasong Pan](http://www.linkedin.com/in/xipan).
I hope to receive their reviews by the end of January. Then, will
spend another 2-3 weeks to take their recommendations into account
and the book will go out at the end of February.

<div class="book-event"/>
Dec 6, 2015:
I've received **63 emails** so far and it's time to choose the best candidates.
I will do it in the next few days and will email them. I will announce
the names of selected reviewers here, soon. Thanks a lot to all of you,
for your readiness to help!

Nov 22, 2015:
The book is ready in its first draft, version **0.1**.
I invite you to become its first reviewer. Send me
an [email](mailto:book@yegor256.com) with a short description about yourself.
I will select a few reviewers (8 is the number I have in mind now).
Then, I will send you a book. It's free and I will
pay for shipping. You will read it (200 pages), and make your corrections
right inside the book. Then, ship it back to me using
UPS [collect on delivery](https://www.ups.com/content/us/en/shipping/time/service/value_added/cod.html).
Your name will be in the book, on the 9th page,
in the list of **acknowledgments**!
I'm interested in your negative feedback mostly.
Tell me what is not clear, what is missing, what needs a more detailed
explanation. But, please, **don't argue** with my ideas. I won't change
them, based on your review. For example, if I'm saying that a
static method is a bad thing and you disagree, don't try to
convince me, it won't help :) This is my opinion and this is what the
book is about. However, I'm sure that my **explanations** and **arguments**
have many flaws. As an early reviewer, you will help me find them.
Again, don't argue with **what** I'm preaching, but complain about **how** I do it.

<div class="book-event"/>
Sep 1, 2015:
The manuscript is finished, in its first draft. Took about 200 hours. Most
of the ideas were taken from the articles previously published on the blog.

<div class="book-event"/>
Jul 5, 2015:
I started to write it.
