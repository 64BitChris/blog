pattern in object oriented languages, is instead an anti-pattern
and must be avoided. The discussion was be based on this blog post:

**What's wrong about NULL in OOP?**
This webinar was about NULL references/pointers in object-oriented
programming and their negative effect on the entire design
of your application.
The webinar was mostly motivated by this post:
[Why NULL is Bad?]({% pst 2014/may/2014-05-13-why-null-is-bad %}).
My attitude towards NULL references is very negative, so be prepared
for an OOP "radicalism" there.

**Immutable Objects vs Common Sense.**

in an object-oriented programming.
The webinar was based on this post:
[Immutable Objects Are Not Dumb]({% pst 2014/dec/2014-12-22-immutable-objects-not-dumb %}).
I made a few slides for this webinar, to illustrate my point better.
There were some interesting questions asked too.

**Objects vs Static Methods.**
The first webinar, where we discussed the
difference between static methods and objects in object-oriented languages, like Java.
Of course, I'm in favor of objects :) The webinar is basically
motivated by this earlier post:
[Composable Decorators vs. Imperative Utility Methods]({% pst 2015/feb/2015-02-26-composable-decorators %}).
It took a bit longer than an hour.
