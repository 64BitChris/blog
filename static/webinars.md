**Don't Create Objects That End With -ER**
We'll talk about class naming principles and a very typical
problem of misusing "-er" suffix for them, for example in
Managers, Observers, Controllers, Filters, Helpers, etc. The
discussion will be based on this post:
[Don't Create Objects That End With -ER]({% pst 2015/mar/2015-03-09-objects-end-with-er %}).

**Why Getters-and-Setters Is An Anti-Pattern?**
We discussed why Getters-and-Setters, a very popular design
pattern in object oriented languages, is instead an anti-pattern
and must be avoided. The discussion was be based on this blog post:
[Getters/Setters. Evil. Period.]({% pst 2014/sep/2014-09-16-getters-and-setters-are-evil %})

**What's wrong about NULL in OOP?**
This webinar was about NULL references/pointers in object-oriented
programming and their negative effect on the entire design
of your application.
The webinar was mostly motivated by this post:
[Why NULL is Bad?]({% pst 2014/may/2014-05-13-why-null-is-bad %}).
My attitude towards NULL references is very negative, so be prepared
for an OOP "radicalism" there.

**Immutable Objects vs Common Sense.**
The second webinar, about immutable objects and their pros and cons
in an object-oriented programming.
The webinar was based on this post:
[Immutable Objects Are Not Dumb]({% pst 2014/dec/2014-12-22-immutable-objects-not-dumb %}).
I made a few slides for this webinar, to illustrate my point better.
There were some interesting questions asked too.

**Objects vs Static Methods.**
The first webinar, where we discussed the
difference between static methods and objects in object-oriented languages, like Java.
Of course, I'm in favor of objects :) The webinar is basically
motivated by this earlier post:
[Composable Decorators vs. Imperative Utility Methods]({% pst 2015/feb/2015-02-26-composable-decorators %}).
It took a bit longer than an hour.
