What does freedom mean to you?”</p><figure class="picture"><img src="https://www.yegor256.com/images/paintings/2017/fall.jpg" style="width:350px;max-width:100%;" alt="picture" /></figure><p><em>Fall</em><br /> November 2017; 31.5 x 31.5 x 0.8 in; Acrylic on canvas; Odessa, Ukraine. “Small and big losses seem to be the essence of anyone’s life; we can learn to enjoy them or we can resent the even fact of losing; it seems that Nature itself invented this drama.”</p><figure class="picture"><img src="https://www.yegor256.com/images/paintings/2017/obsession.jpg" style="width:350px;max-width:100%;" alt="picture" /></figure><p><em>Obsession</em><br /> October 2017; 31.5 x 31.5 x 0.8 in; Acrylic on canvas; Odessa, Ukraine. “I’m trying to understand the mystery of simplicity; obviously, the most powerful images are the most simple and even primitive; what do these three simple colors mean for you?”</p><figure class="picture"><img src="https://www.yegor256.com/images/paintings/2017/not-in-love.jpg" style="width:350px;max-width:100%;" alt="picture" /></figure><p><em>Not in love</em><br /> October 2017;

31.5 x 31.5 x 0.8 in; Acrylic on canvas; Odessa, Ukraine. “When she is in love, it’s difficult to say what exactly is on her mind; it’s even more difficult to say what she expects and wants, and she doesn’t want; the trick is to figure out which color is the right one.”</p><figure class="picture"><img src="https://www.yegor256.com/images/paintings/2017/shame.jpg" style="width:350px;max-width:100%;" alt="picture" /></figure><p><em>Shame</em><br /> September 2017;

31.5 x 31.5 x 0.8 in; Acrylic on canvas; Odessa, Ukraine. “We all expect ourselves to be better than we are; we expect our value and our uniqueness to be higher than they are; I had a discussion with a friend of mine about her inability to be happy because of her high expectations on herself; this painting demonstrates how easily we can imprison our growth in a jail of expectations.”</p><figure class="picture"><img src="https://www.yegor256.com/images/paintings/2017/doubts.jpg" style="width:350px;max-width:100%;" alt="picture" /></figure><p><em>Doubts</em><br /> August 2017;

31.5 x 31.5 x 0.8 in; Acrylic on canvas; Odessa, Ukraine. “There are so many things that make a woman attractive; it’s difficult to say which one catches you when you see her; why not lips, if it’s a beach, you’re alone, and she is beautiful?”</p><figure class="picture"><img src="https://www.yegor256.com/images/paintings/2017/seven-and-one.jpg" style="width:350px;max-width:100%;" alt="picture" /></figure><p><em>Seven and One</em><br /> August 2017; 31.5 x 31.5 x 0.8 in; Acrylic on canvas; Odessa, Ukraine. “It was a long discussion about modern world fears; how they transform us, how they affect our lives, and what we can really do with them; the conclusion was that there is very little or nothing and it’s very sad.”</p><figure class="picture"><img src="https://www.yegor256.com/images/paintings/2017/objectification.jpg" style="width:350px;max-width:100%;" alt="picture" /></figure><p><em>Objectification</em><br /> July 2017;
