In January I wrote mostly about management (don't know why). These
are the most interesting, I guess:

 * [Daily Stand-Up Meetings Are a Good Tool for a Bad Manager](...)
   rants about that stand-up meetings most of us are fed up with
   and explains what a good manager replaces them with.

 * [Making Your Boss Happy Is a False Objective](...)
   is about motivation of a professional team player and how it
   should be affected by the feedback of a boss or a customer. My point
   here is that a strong and serious project member always works for a project itself,
   not for its sponsor.

 * [How to Cut Corners and Stay Cool](...)
   is about [our](http://www.teamed.io) unique (according to the comments under the article)
   management approach to scope decomposition and control. I was surprised
   to see how many of my readers believe in something completely opposite.

In the next posts I'll get back to more technical subjects and
will write about object-oriented programming and, as usual, some evil anti-patterns :)
BTW, if you have any suggestions for future topics, don't hesitate to
reply to this email. I'll take them into consideration.
