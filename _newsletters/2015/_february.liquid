I've got an email from one of my readers a few days ago, let me share it with you:

"_I’ve read everything on your blog and how teamed.io works.
It’s so brilliant that it’s somewhat restored my faith in the possibility
that mass corporate software development can be something other than
a soul crushing, life sucking dark hole._"

It was a pleasure to hear that :) Here is what I've written during the last month,
about object-oriented programming:

 * [Utility Classes Have Nothing to Do With Functional Programming](http://www.yegor256.com/2015/02/20/utility-classes-vs-functional-programming.html)
   makes a point in a discussion started earlier on Twitter about
   the difference between utility classes and true functional
   programming paradigm.

 * [Composable Decorators vs. Imperative Utility Methods](http://www.yegor256.com/2015/02/26/composable-decorators.html)
   introduces one of my favorite patterns (Decorator) and demonstrates
   how composable decorators shall replace utility methods and
   utility classes (yeah, I really hate them).

In the next few weeks I'm planning to release a new immutable Java web
framework and dedicate a few posts to it.
It's called [takes.org](http://www.takes.org). It will
be designed in a pure object-oriented style, just like some of my posts
recommend. And it's going to be used in a few commercial projects right
after its release. It's open source, MIT license, in
[Github](https://github.com/yegor256/takes).
