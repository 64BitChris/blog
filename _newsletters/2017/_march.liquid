I wrote three new articles in the last month:

  * [The TDD That Works for Me](http://www.yegor256.com/2017/03/24/tdd-that-works.html)
    is a criticism of a classic tests-first approach and a discussion of how
    tests can really help if we do it tests-last and then tests-first.

  * [Traits and Mixins Are Not OOP](http://www.yegor256.com/2017/03/07/traits-and-mixins.html)
    is a quick overview of a rather popular and at the same time
    very wrong technique of code reuse, in Ruby, PHP, Java and other languages.

  * [SOLID Is OOP for Dummies](http://www.yegor256.com/2017/03/28/solid.html)
    adds my few cents to this very popular set of design principles.

Don't miss [Webinar #23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nm274dGikFc) next week
about Puzzle Driven Development, the methodology that helps us automate programming, at
[11am PST]()
(click here for a Google event).

Don't forget to submit your open source project to
the annual [software quality award](http://www.yegor256.com/award.html).
The prize is $4,096, to be rewarded in November 2017.

I'll be speaking at
[JPoint](https://jpoint.ru/en/talks/java-annotations-are-a-big-mistake/) (Moscow, Russia)
next week, about Java annotations. If you're still
in doubt whether to attend of not, don't hesitate&mdash;it's one of the best
software events. Also, you will be able
to buy the second volume of Elegant Objects for just $20 if you attend it
(once it's published in April).
