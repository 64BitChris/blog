A month ago I asked to post reviews on Amazon for my book "Elegant Objects"
([vol.1](http://amzn.to/2uRRubs) and [vol.2](http://amzn.to/2vYxgNt)). Some of
you did that and I truly appreciated that. I mailed those supported these cute
durable cactus stickers. Please, if you didn't review the books yet, do it now
and email me your postal address. I will send you the stickers!
