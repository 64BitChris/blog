Thanks for staying in this mailing list. Good news, over the last
month I've sold over 150 copies of [Elegant Objects](http://goo.gl/5Yfx1i)
and donated all profit to Donald Trump's campaign! It's a joke.
About the campaign. But the first part is true &mdash; the book is rather
popular on Amazon. I've got [seven reviews](http://goo.gl/POjGhz)
already and they keep coming. Please, don't forget to post yours, you will
help a lot in making this book popular. Thanks!

I would suggest to take a look at these two articles, published recently:

  * [Pimp Up Your Resume](http://www.yegor256.com/2016/03/08/pimp-up-your-resume.html)
    is a full list of what I think a resume of a professional software
    developer must include, to look attractive.

  * [Unspoken Secrets of an Elevator Pitch](http://www.yegor256.com/2016/03/28/unspoken-secrets-of-elevator-pitch.html)
    is a satirical summary of what is wrong with the startup industry. If you've
    ever had any experience with raising capital, you will find
    it fun to read.

Don't miss the second webinar about management, next Wednesday
[at 11am PST](https://plus.google.com/events/cn2nne1qnm8t475bt461igccrg4).
We'll discuss the role of a Software Architect, its authority and obligations.

In a few weeks I'll be speaking at two big Java conferences:
[JPoint](http://javapoint.ru/en/) in Moscow on April 23 and
[JETConf](http://jetconf.by/#/yegor_bugayenko) in Minsk on April 25.
I'll be giving away a few copies of [Elegant Objects](http://goo.gl/5Yfx1i), mostly to
those who ask most interesting questions. Don't miss a chance.
