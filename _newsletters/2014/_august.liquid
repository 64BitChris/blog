Hope you all are enjoying this summer :) Here is what I mostly wrote about
in [my blog](http://www.yegor256.com), in this August:

 * "Release in One Click" stories that explain how
   we deploy our products to
   [Maven Central](http),
   [RubyGems](), and
   [CloudBees]()
   using [rultor.com](http://www.rultor.com). These articles are rather
   technical, but they cover the entire "continuous delivery" workflow,
   from the very start start till that final "new version released!" tweet.

 * [Strict Control of Java Code Quality](http://www.yegor256.com/2014/08/13/strict-code-quality-control.html)
   is an introductory article for
   [qulice.com](http://www.qulice.com), an open source product we've been using
   and improving since 2011.

Besides that, I started to write book reviews. Hopefully they will
be both interesting to read and encouraging to buy that books and read
them in full. I will write only about books I enjoy(ed) reading.
The first review is about
["The Art of Software Testing"](http://www.yegor256.com/2014/08/22/art-of-software-testing.html)
by Glenford Myers. As I said in the review, the book is one of my favorite. Give it a try,
it will change your vision. Well, it should :)

Thanks for staying in my list of subscribers!
