July was mostly dedicated to a rebirth of [Rultor.com](http://www.rultor.com).
The product was created a year ago, but in a preliminary and rather heavy
version. We were using it successfully for a year, but it had multiple problems
and was difficult to maintain. Over-engineering is a very common desease :)

Over the last month I re-wrote it almost from scratch. Now it works
amazingly smoothly. I've published a few articles about it in
[the blog](http://www.yegor256.com). The most interesting are these two:

[Rultor.com, a Merging Bot](http://www.yegor256.com/2014/07/24/rultor-automated-merging.html)
explains how Rultor helps me in all projects I'm working on. It
also explains how merge operation can be automated by Rultor, and how
[Docker containers](http://doc.rultor.com/docker.html) help us isolate builds.

[Rultor + Travis]()
gives a lot of technical details about Rultor usage in open source
Github projects. Moreover, it gives a few real-life examples of combining
Rultor with [Travis](http://travis-ci.org).

BTW, I would appreciate if you reply to this email with a short feedback
about what you think I should improve. I mean, maybe something is boring
to read or something is missing. Negative feedback is welcome :)
