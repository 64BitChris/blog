There were a few interesting posts in [the blog](http://www.yegor256.com) last month:

 * [Are You a Hacker or a Designer?](http://www.yegor256.com/2014/10/26/hacker-vs-programmer-mentality.html)
   posted most recently claims that the time of "hacker mentality" is fading out
   because computers are getting cheaper and programmers' salaries
   keep growing. It is time of "designer" mentality.

 * [What Does a Software Architect Do?](http://www.yegor256.com/2014/10/12/who-is-software-architect.html)
   summarizes my vision of a technical lead (or an architect) role in
   any software project. I believe that an architect is much more than
   just a title or a sign of respect - it is also a responsibility and
   an authority.

 * [Continuous Integration is Dead](http://www.yegor256.com/2014/10/08/continuous-integration-is-dead.html)
   explains what's wrong about a traditional CI approach
   and how the problem is fixed by a previously explained
   "Read-Only Master Branch" approach.

 * [DI Containers are Code Polluters](http://www.yegor256.com/2014/10/03/di-containers-are-evil.html)
   is about depenedency injection containers, like Guice or Spring IoC, and
   their negative effect on code readability and cleanness.
