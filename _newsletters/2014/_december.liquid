Here is what I wrote in the [blog](http://www.yegor256.com) in December:

 * [ORM Is an Offensive Anti-Pattern](http://www.yegor256.com/2014/12/01/orm-offensive-anti-pattern.html)
   gives a long-waiting answer to the question some of my friends
   asked me for years. I was always against object-relational mapping,
   but never had a good reason for it. Finally I found a reason and explained
   it in this post.

 * [How an Immutable Object Can Have State and Behavior?](http://www.yegor256.com/2014/12/09/immutable-object-state-and-behavior.html)
   and [Immutable Objects Are Not Dumb](http://www.yegor256.com/2014/12/22/immutable-objects-not-dumb.html)
   are talking about immutable objects (one of my favorite subjects). I both
   posts I'm trying to explain how immutable objects are different from
   constants and why immutable objects can be used as building blocks in
   any applications.

 * [You Do Need Independent Technical Reviews!](http://www.yegor256.com/2014/12/18/independent-technical-reviews.html)
   is about a management approach we use in our projects in
   [teamed.io](http://www.teamed.io) in order to keep quality
   and customer satisfaction under control. If you're managing a team
   of programmers, this may be an interesting read.

About a week ago I joined Dzone.com as an MVB and they
re-published the article about ORM. Not suprisingly, I got quite a few
comments [down there](http://java.dzone.com/articles/orm-offensive-anti-pattern), feel free do add yours.

By the way, Happy New Year! I don't know most of you guys personally, but
I assume we're in the same software development industry.
Thus, in 2015, I wish all of us a lot more of clean code :)
