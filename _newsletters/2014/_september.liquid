There were two interesting articles published in
[my blog](http://www.yegor256.com) over the last month:

 * [Getters/Setters. Evil. Period.](http://www.yegor256.com/2014/09/16/getters-and-setters-are-evil.html)
   explains there is no place for methods prefixed with
   "get" or "set" in an ideal object-oriented world.

 * [Monetary Awards Can Work](http://www.yegor256.com/2014/09/24/why-monetary-awards-dont-work.html)
   shows

A few weeks ago I joined JavaCodeGeeks community and got
some interesting feedback from its readers, especially
for my articles about
"Why NULL is bad" and
"Typical Mistakes in Java Code".

Thanks for staying in my list of subscribers!
