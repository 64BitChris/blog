This is the first monthly update from my blog (www.yegor256.com).

The blog is about software development, mostly in Java. I'm writing about
the projects I'm working on, including Jcabi, ReXSL, Qulice,
Rultor (former FaZend), and many others. By the end of every month
I'm summarizing everything that has been written during the month and sending you
this update email.

Here is what was interesting:

[Objects Should Be Immutable](http://www.yegor256.com/2014/06/09/objects-should-be-immutable.html)
is a provocative writing about why all objects in a proper object-oriented
programming should be immutable (never allow to modify their encapsulated data).
The article was aggressively discussed at [reddit](http://redd.it/27o915), you're welcome
to drop your opinion there or in blog comments.

[AOP Aspects Method Logging](http://www.yegor256.com/2014/06/01/aop-aspectj-java-method-logging.html)
gives a detailed introduction into [jcabi-aspects](http://aspects.jcabi.com), a library
we've been working with for the last two years. One of its nicest
features explained &mdash; atomatic logging of every call to
annotated Java methods.

[XML+XSLT in Browser](...)
explains the idea of detaching data from presentation in web, through
the use of XSL stylesheets. I tried to explain why I like this approach
and why [ReXSL framework](http://www.rexsl.com) was created three years ago.
I'm going to write more about this subject, this is just a start :)

Besides that, there were other articles, but you can find
them yourself on the blog :)
