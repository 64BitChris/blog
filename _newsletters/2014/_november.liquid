There were some interesting posts in [the blog](http://www.yegor256.com) last month.
I would recommend paying attention to these three:

 * [An Empty Line is a Code Smell](http://www.yegor256.com/2014/11/03/empty-line-code-smell.html)
   ...

 * [How Immutability Helps](http://www.yegor256.com/2014/11/07/how-immutability-helps.html)
   gives a practical example of using immutable Java objects in
   designing a new library from scratch. I show in this article, step by step,
   how I created a Java email sending SDK, replacing an existing Apache library.

 * [Seven Virtues of a Good Object](http://www.yegor256.com/2014/11/20/seven-virtues-of-good-object.html)
   is a summary review of a good object design, as I see it. I mentioned
   seven the most important qualities of a properly designed object,
   with examples in Java. While some of these characteristics are
   debatable, I believe that most of them, if you take them into account,
   may help in making your object-oriented software better.

Thanks for your comments under the posts, they help me
to understand mistakes and learn from them :)
