<p>I'm Yegor Bugayenko, a software architect, passionate
about software quality. I write mostly in Java, but also in
PHP, Ruby, Python and JavaScript.
I'm a co-founder and CTO of <a href="http://www.teamed.io/">teamed.io</a>.</p>

<p>Once in a month I'm sending a summary email of my writing activity. If
you're interested to know what's going on here, I can add you to my
mailing list. Just give me your email address and briefly explain who are
you and why you're interested (I'm trying to avoid anonymous
subscribers in my list).<p>

<fieldset id="form">
  <label for="email">Your email</label>
  <input id="email" class="field field-text" name="email" size="25" maxlength="255"/>
  <label for="reason">Who are you? Why interested?</label>
  <textarea id="reason" cols="50" class="field field-text" rows="4"></textarea>
  <label for="subscribe"></label>
  <button id="subscribe" class="field">Subscribe</button>
  <span id="error" style="color:red;"></span>
</fieldset>

<p>You can always <a href="/unsubscribe.html">unsubscribe</a>.</p>
