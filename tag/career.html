a real story, and it’s not only about Google. I’m getting emails from recruiters at Amazon, Facebook, and smaller Silicon Valley startups. They find me somehow, most likely through this blog, my &lt;a href=&quot;/books.html&quot;&gt;books&lt;/a&gt;, or my &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/yegor256&quot;&gt;GitHub account&lt;/a&gt;. They always start with “We’re so impressed by your profile” and finish with “Let’s schedule an interview.” I always reply with the same text, and they always disappear, only to come back in a few months under a different name. Let me explain my reasons; maybe you will do the same and we can change this situation in the industry.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;!--more--&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;jb_picture&quot;&gt;&lt;img itemprop=&quot;image&quot; alt=&quot;The Deer Hunter (1978) by Michael Cimino&quot; src=&quot;/images/2017/02/the-deer-hunter.jpg&quot; longdesc=&quot;#ddecf58a&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption id=&quot;ddecf58a&quot;&gt;The Deer Hunter (1978) by Michael Cimino&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Disclaimer: I do realize that these are multi-billion-dollar companies, the best in the industry, and I’m nothing compared to them. I do realize that their recruiters don’t care about my answers—they simply click “delete” and move on. I also realize that they will never see this post, and this article probably won’t change anything. However, I have to write it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;youtube&quot;&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhWOlaMqppM&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;box&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZhWOlaMqppM/mqdefault.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;YouTube video #ZhWOlaMqppM&quot; /&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;play&quot;&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;icon icon-play&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;div&gt;How I didn't get a job at Amazon (in Russian with English subtitles); 21 December 2017.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is what I’m sending back to them:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thanks for your email. I’m very interested indeed. I have nothing against an interview. However, there is one condition: I have to be interviewed by the person I will be working for. By my future direct manager.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;The recruiter who gets this reply never gets back to me.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Why do I send this?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Well, because I learned my lesson two years ago, when Amazon tried to recruit me. I got an email from the company that said they were so impressed by my profile and couldn’t wait to start working with me. They needed me, nobody else. I was naive, and the message did flatter me.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;They paid for my ticket to fly there and a night in a 5-star hotel. I was impressed.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;We scheduled an interview in the head office in Seattle. They paid for my ticket to fly there (from San Francisco) and a night in a 5-star hotel. I was impressed. They definitely were interested. So was I.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What happened at the interview was, most probably, very close to what Max Howell &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mxcl/status/608682016205344768&quot;&gt;experienced&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9695102&quot;&gt;with Google&lt;/a&gt;: some programmers who didn’t know a thing about my profile asked me to invent some algorithms on a white board for almost four hours. Did I manage? I don’t think so. Did they make me an offer? No.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What did I learn?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That it was a waste of time. For both sides.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Their bureaucratic machine is designed to process hundreds of candidates a month. In order to fish and attract them, there is an army of &lt;del&gt;monkeys&lt;/del&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/09/29/mayonnaise.html&quot;&gt;recruiters&lt;/a&gt; sending warm emails to people like me. They have to screen candidates somehow, and they are too lazy to make this process effective and creative. They just send them through random programmers who are supposed to ask as complex questions as possible.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I’m not saying that people who pass their tests are not good programmers. I’m also not saying that I’m a good programmer—let’s face it, I didn’t pass the test. I do believe this filtering system is rather good. My point is that it contradicts the original email I got from the recruiter.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If she would have started her email with “We’re looking for an algorithm expert,” we would never have gotten any further and would not have wasted our time. Clearly, I’m not an expert in algorithms. There is no point in giving me binary-tree-traversing questions; I don’t know those answers and will never be interested in learning them. I’m trying to be an expert in something else, like &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/11/29/eolang.html&quot;&gt;object-oriented design&lt;/a&gt;, for example.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;There is no point in giving me binary-tree-traversing questions; I don't know those answers and will never be interested in learning them.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;There was a clear mismatch between my profile and the expectations of the interviewers. I don’t blame them, and I don’t blame her. They all were just &lt;del&gt;slaves&lt;/del&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/10/06/how-to-be-good-office-slave.html&quot;&gt;employees&lt;/a&gt;. I blame myself for not setting this all straight at the very beginning.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I should have told her that I didn’t want to be interviewed by &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; programmers, because I would most certainly fail. There was no need to try. I wanted to be interviewed by the person who really &lt;em&gt;needed&lt;/em&gt; me: my future boss. That person will understand my profile and won’t ask pointless questions about algorithms, simply because he or she will know what my duties will be and what kind of problems I will be capable of solving, if they hired me.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, as I keep observing from two years of bouncing such emails back to recruiters, they can’t change anything. They have to provide formal and standard screening for everybody, beginning with those same warm and flattering initial promises.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I’m sorry, recruiters, no more standard interviews for me.&lt;/p&gt; " /> <meta name="keywords" content="next, path, output, content, previous, url, relative_path, id, collection, excerpt, draft, categories, layout, title, date, place, tags, description, keywords, translated, social, image, jb_picture, republished, slug, ext" /> <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1"/> <meta name="google-site-verification" content="JEj_gQr2CPe2QKGw8XdMz0R7VboQIUbX3FlM-lwTq-8" /> <meta name="author" content="Yegor Bugayenko"> <meta name="article:published_time" content="2017-02-21 00:00:00 +0000"> <meta name="og:site_name" content="Yegor Bugayenko"/> <meta name="og:type" content="article" /> <meta name="og:locale" content="en_US" /> <meta name="twitter:account_id" content="4503599630178231" /> <meta name="twitter:creator" content="@yegor256"/> <meta name="twitter:site" content="@yegor256"/> <meta name="twitter:title" property="og:title" content="Why I Don't Talk to Google Recruiters"/> <meta name="twitter:description" property="og:description" content="&lt;p&gt;This is a real story, and it’s not only about Google.

However, there were many complaints about this metric. Take, for example, the ones &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.yegor256.com/2014/10/29/how-much-do-you-cost.html#comment-1704113248&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.yegor256.com/2014/10/29/how-much-do-you-cost.html#comment-1697910905&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. In a nutshell, so many of you disagreed and said that the number of StackOverflow up-votes was nothing more than a measurement of the amount of time someone spent answering stupid questions asked by clueless programmers. Let me disagree and explain why your activity on this platform is so important to &lt;a href=&quot;/2017/01/24/career-advice.html&quot;&gt;your career&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;!--more--&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;jb_picture&quot;&gt;&lt;img itemprop=&quot;image&quot; alt=&quot;Les kidnappeurs (1998) by Graham Guit&quot; src=&quot;/images/2017/02/les-kidnappeurs.jpg&quot; longdesc=&quot;#87a94d52&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption id=&quot;87a94d52&quot;&gt;Les kidnappeurs (1998) by Graham Guit&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Basically, your StackOverflow profile demonstrates five skills you either have or don’t. They may not be as important to an office &lt;del&gt;slave&lt;/del&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/10/06/how-to-be-good-office-slave.html&quot;&gt;worker&lt;/a&gt;, but if you’re going to work &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/08/05/distributed-teams-are-higher-quality.html&quot;&gt;remotely&lt;/a&gt;, they are crucial.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to Search&lt;/strong&gt;. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.stackexchange.com&quot;&gt;StackExchange&lt;/a&gt; knowledge base is huge and contains answers to almost any software question you may ask. You have to know how to search it, and not only via Google. You have to be familiar with the platform and its key features, and you can’t learn that without being an active user. When your reputation is high, it’s a clear indicator to me, your potential employer, that you’re aware of how to find the right information in this knowledge base.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to Ask&lt;/strong&gt;. Asking a friend near the coffee machine is one thing. Asking a community of 6+ million developers is a totally different thing. You have to learn how to explain your problem, how to formulate the question, how to label it and title it. Try it for the first time and you will see that it’s not easy at all; your questions will sound immature, silly, and ambiguous, and they will end with “Best regards” (something you shouldn’t do at SO). And, of course, they will get zero up-votes. Later, when you improve, you will be surprised to see that more and more of them get up-votes, and your reputation will grow. This will be the indicator that your “question asking” skill is growing up. For me, your potential employer, it’s a very important skill.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to Answer&lt;/strong&gt;. Initially, you will be afraid to answer. Then, most of your answers will be down-voted. Then, some of them will be accepted as best answers. Eventually, some of them will start getting up-votes. Until that happens, you will go through a lot of frustration and negative emotions. You will learn how to make your answers helpful—not just to your friends, because they don’t want to offend you by saying that you have no idea what you’re talking about, but to strangers, who care more about the information you’re able to deliver than they care about you personally. That’s a skill you can’t buy; you have to earn it. And it’s crucial in a distributed team.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;It is a must-have instrument for any modern software developer, no matter what your programming language, your age, your project, or your professional level are.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to Deal With Morons&lt;/strong&gt;. You know what to do with them in the office, but on the Internet, they are much more aggressive and offensive. And there are many of them. You need to learn and practice a lot before you become competent enough to fetch information out of that programming community without pulling your hair out and screaming at the monitor. StackOverflow will help you a lot, both through questions you will ask and answers you will try to give. And you can’t learn that in the office dealing with your friends only.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to Deal With Smart-asses&lt;/strong&gt;. Some people there are very smart and knowledgeable, and they will not always be polite when your questions or mistakes using the platform border on being too annoying. Again, your office friends won’t teach you how to deal with those gurus so you can tap their knowledge; you have to be actively involved in StackOverflow discussions. This skill is very important for distributed programming, where you have to solve most of the problems on your own.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To summarize, StackOverflow is a must-have &lt;em&gt;instrument&lt;/em&gt; for any modern software developer, no matter what your programming language, your age, your project, or your professional level are. It’s like an IDE and &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/02/09/are-you-still-debugging.html&quot;&gt;unit tests&lt;/a&gt;—you just use them in order to develop faster. Some people are still using &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_%28text_editor%29&quot;&gt;vim&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emacs&quot;&gt;emacs&lt;/a&gt; and writing no tests, but you don’t want to be like them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;StackOverflow is not just a website where you may have an account if you feel like it. It’s a &lt;em&gt;mandatory&lt;/em&gt; instrument you have to use if you want me, your potential employer, to value you as a serious engineer. And if you use this instrument on a daily basis, your &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/03/08/pimp-up-your-resume.html&quot;&gt;reputation&lt;/a&gt; will inevitably reach high levels.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;badge&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://stackexchange.com/users/63162&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://stackexchange.com/users/flair/63162.png&quot; style=&quot;width:208px;max-width:100%;&quot; alt=&quot;badge&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;By the way, this is my &lt;a href=&quot;http://stackexchange.com/users/63162&quot;&gt;StackExchange profile&lt;/a&gt;.

make a decision on how much we should pay a software developer. However, there were many complaints about this metric.

What are the exact steps that won’t waste time and will get you there faster? Let me share what I think might be helpful.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;!--more--&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;jb_picture&quot;&gt;&lt;img itemprop=&quot;image&quot; alt=&quot;The Grand Budapest Hotel (2014) by Wes Anderson&quot; src=&quot;/images/2017/01/the-grand-budapest-hotel.jpg&quot; longdesc=&quot;#3c7b6134&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption id=&quot;3c7b6134&quot;&gt;The Grand Budapest Hotel (2014) by Wes Anderson&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Before writing this, I &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/webhp?q=career%20advice%20software%20developer&quot;&gt;Googled&lt;/a&gt; a bit and found a lot of interesting suggestions, like to be helpful, make friends, be language agnostic, code a lot, try to prove your bosses wrong, avoid conflicts, exercise, etc. Some of them are good, while others are very wrong, but most of them are just too far away from the main point.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I want to share what I believe will look more or less like explicit instructions of what to do tomorrow to become a $100-per-hour software architect in a few years. Well, they worked and keep working for me.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t Be Loyal&lt;/strong&gt;. The company you are working for at the moment is just a training ground, nothing else. Don’t invest an &lt;del&gt;extra&lt;/del&gt; minute of your time into it. Be selfish; think only about yourself and your personal skills, knowledge, and experience. They pay you to be dedicated and loyal? Well, that’s their fault. Use them to learn new technologies, experiment with new ideas, train and educate yourself, get new certificates, meet new people, etc. They must work &lt;em&gt;for you&lt;/em&gt;, not the other way around.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;They pay you to be dedicated and loyal? Well, that's their fault.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t Work&lt;/strong&gt;. Make sure programming is your &lt;em&gt;hobby&lt;/em&gt;, not your job. Everything else must be secondary, including your family, friends, and WoW. Software engineering is your family, your passion, your friend, and your life. Without that attitude, you will always be a slave to those who think like that. You must not work; you must have fun in front of the laptop. More fun than you’re having anywhere else. Never do anything that is not fun. If you notice you’re writing some code because you “have to” instead of because “you want to,” stop immediately. Something is going wrong and you’re shooting yourself in the foot; your career is in trouble.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t Make Friends&lt;/strong&gt;. I’m talking about professional relationships in the office, within your projects, at the company you’re working for. Remember that 99 percent of people will not become experts. They will remain who they are—regular programmers with no passion or ambition. What’s really bad for you is that they will want you to stay &lt;em&gt;with them&lt;/em&gt;. Nobody will enjoy seeing your growth, and your closest friends will become your enemies. Not explicitly, but subconsciously they will do everything they can to prevent you from getting better and leaving them. And you will have to leave them if you grow up. To avoid all that, stay professional and don’t make friends at work.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Nobody will enjoy seeing your growth, and your closest friends will become your enemies.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t Be Helpful&lt;/strong&gt;. There are more than 10 million programmers in the world. They all need help. Why do you need to help that dude sitting next to you in the office? You won’t save the world by helping people around you—forget that religious nonsense. If you really want to do good for the software industry, focus on bigger things: make an open source product, write a book, or improve the documentation of the project you are working on. By &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/02/16/it-is-not-a-school.html&quot;&gt;helping&lt;/a&gt; people around you and solving &lt;em&gt;their&lt;/em&gt; problems, you just cripple them, nothing else.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t Ask for Help&lt;/strong&gt;. Expect the same attitude from programmers around you. Again, the same argument applies: There are &lt;a href=&quot;https://sostats.github.io/&quot;&gt;more than 6 million accounts&lt;/a&gt; registered on the StackExchange platform; if you need help, ask them. Don’t ask your friends or colleagues. Train yourself to get help from public sources or from your project documentation. By asking people around you, you’re making your life easier in the short term only. In the long run, you will lack that important skill of knowing how to find information. You will become a hostage to those friends who help you. Also, don’t learn from people around you; learn from books, StackOverflow, and open source software.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;You must be prepared to say &quot;No&quot; to your friends, your family, your habits, your wishes, your projects, colleagues, classes, methods, and lines of code.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t Waste Time&lt;/strong&gt;. This is probably the most important advice, which I have to give myself first of all—unfortunately, I waste a lot of time. Any growth is always about saying “No.” You must be prepared to say it to your friends, your family, your habits, your wishes, your projects, colleagues, classes, methods, and lines of code. Stop the projects that are taking time and giving nothing back. Don’t call back those whom you don’t need. Yes, they need you, but you don’t need them. This may sound harsh and selfish, but that’s the only way to get where you want to be. Time is your main resource; be very greedy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t Skimp on Growth&lt;/strong&gt;. You must invest into yourself. First of all, you have to buy books. Don’t steal them, even though &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/11/09/why-no-ebooks.html&quot;&gt;you can&lt;/a&gt;. Buy them, spending your &lt;em&gt;own&lt;/em&gt; money. You will take them way more serious. You will respect yourself for owning the library. You will feel that software engineering is forever with you; it’s not temporary, it’s not just a job, it’s your life. Two books per month is your absolute minimum. Second, pay for certificates for the same reasons. Third, purchase software; don’t steal it. Finally, don’t be cheap on your laptop. It is much more important than your car or a birthday gift for your spouse. Your laptop is your instrument; it must be &lt;del&gt;good and expensive&lt;/del&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;/2017/06/27/my-environment.html&quot;&gt;made by Apple&lt;/a&gt;. You must go “all in” if you want to win.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t Work Full-Time&lt;/strong&gt;. As much as possible, try to stay away from full-time, 9-to-5 jobs—they pause your professional growth. Permanent or long-term employment gives you a stable income, a comfortable office environment, a predictable set of technical problems to solve, and the ability to become an expert over a small territory. At the same time, it takes away &lt;em&gt;fear&lt;/em&gt;. That’s right, fear. You are not afraid anymore, and that’s why you stop growing. To grow and grow fast, you must always be challenged by new tasks, new teams, new projects, and new job interviews. You must always prove that you are worth something. Ideally, you must work on two to three projects part-time and change them every 6 to 12 months.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t Be Cheap&lt;/strong&gt;. Forget the stories that teach “money is not everything, and an interesting project is much more important”—they are for losers. Money &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/09/24/why-monetary-awards-dont-work.html&quot;&gt;is everything&lt;/a&gt;. An interesting project will be &lt;em&gt;properly&lt;/em&gt; funded. If it’s not funded, the market doesn’t need it. What are you doing there then? The only answer is that you’re not as good as &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/10/29/how-much-do-you-cost.html&quot;&gt;others&lt;/a&gt;; that’s how they managed to buy you. My advice is to never pay attention to those cheap stories; &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/01/12/good-programmers-dont-work-for-equity.html&quot;&gt;demand cash&lt;/a&gt;, up front, as much as possible.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t Be Skeptical About Certifications&lt;/strong&gt;. Many programmers think certifications are not important now because they don’t really validate anything and are issued simply for money by big companies. Don’t think like that. Certifications help you formalize your knowledge, put borders around it, and remove gaps. And they demonstrate to most of your potential employers that you’re truly &lt;em&gt;serious&lt;/em&gt; about software engineering.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t Ignore Management&lt;/strong&gt;. Being a good programmer is not the same as being a good architect or a team leader. To move higher in that hierarchy, you must understand &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/05/24/who-is-project-manager.html&quot;&gt;project management&lt;/a&gt;. And it’s not just being nice to people and wearing a suit. It’s a science, with a lot of rules, principles, methods, and best practices. You must study them and become very good at them. Just as good as you are in Java or C++. Start with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Management_Body_of_Knowledge&quot;&gt;PMBOK&lt;/a&gt; and earn your &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Management_Professional&quot;&gt;PMP&lt;/a&gt; certification.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t Underestimate English&lt;/strong&gt;. Most of my readers are not native English speakers, just like myself. I’m addressing this paragraph to you: You must improve your speaking and writing skills; it’s very important. You will never become an &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/10/29/how-much-do-you-cost.html&quot;&gt;expensive&lt;/a&gt; software architect if you can’t speak and write well. And it can’t be Russian in English words. It must be as the English people talk in San Francisco, not in Moscow. The best advice to learn it: Watch English movies with subtitles. You must speak like Matt Damon or Al Pacino, but not like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0uM_xh7WOg&amp;amp;t=29s&quot;&gt;Mutko&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t Ignore Open Source&lt;/strong&gt;. You must be active in the open source community. It’s &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/12/22/why-dont-you-contribute-to-open-source.html&quot;&gt;a must&lt;/a&gt;. You either have your own open source project or you actively contribute to an existing one. Either way, it’s crucial. Working in a closed &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/10/06/how-to-be-good-office-slave.html&quot;&gt;office environment&lt;/a&gt; is one thing, while writing code that is visible to the entire world is a totally different thing. Most programmers are simply afraid of that, and they make up many excuses for why they are not there. Don’t be one of them. Yes, it’s difficult, it’s stressful, it will consume a lot of your private time, and nobody will pay you for it. Do it anyway—this is the fastest way to grow. Moreover, I would recommend you try to open as much source code as possible, even if you write it for private and commercial projects. Some companies won’t be against that.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;I should be able to Google your name and find a lot of professional links, not just your Tinder profile.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t Be Invisible&lt;/strong&gt;. Make sure you have Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and Instagram accounts, along with a blog. You must be present on the Internet. You’re a serious software architect? I should be able to Google your name and find a lot of professional links, not just your Tinder profile. And they will Google your name; don’t ever doubt that. My book &lt;a href=&quot;/256-bloghacks.html&quot;&gt;256 Bloghacks&lt;/a&gt; may help you understand how to do it right.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t Stay Home&lt;/strong&gt;. Attend seminars, meetups, and software conferences. At least once a month, you must go somewhere where other programmers are hanging out. You don’t need to be super active and make a lot of friends—just be there and watch. Eventually you will realize that it’s time to become a speaker. Remember that it doesn’t really matter how much your coworkers respect you. What matters is what the &lt;em&gt;market&lt;/em&gt; thinks about you.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Playing GTA 'til 3 a.m. is not what successful and happy software architects do.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t Forget to Relax&lt;/strong&gt;. Nobody likes those smelly dorks who only get one haircut per year. They will hire you and respect you as a coder, but they will never take you seriously as a candidate for a role with a lot of &lt;del&gt;money&lt;/del&gt; responsibility. You will always look like a mentally unstable person. Instead, you must look “like business,” even though you are a geek. That’s why it’s very important to pay attention to how you spend your free time—how you relax. Playing GTA ‘til 3 a.m. is not what successful and happy software architects do. Instead, here is your short list of activities: sports, tourism, and night clubs. Be a normal person—that’s the point.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Did I miss anything important?&lt;/p&gt; " /> <meta name="keywords" content="next, path, output, content, previous, url, relative_path, id, collection, excerpt, draft, categories, layout, title, date, place, tags, description, keywords, translated, image, jb_picture, slug, ext" /> <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1"/> <meta name="google-site-verification" content="JEj_gQr2CPe2QKGw8XdMz0R7VboQIUbX3FlM-lwTq-8" /> <meta name="author" content="Yegor Bugayenko"> <meta name="article:published_time" content="2017-01-24 00:00:00 +0000"> <meta name="og:site_name" content="Yegor Bugayenko"/> <meta name="og:type" content="article" /> <meta name="og:locale" content="en_US" /> <meta name="twitter:account_id" content="4503599630178231" /> <meta name="twitter:creator" content="@yegor256"/> <meta name="twitter:site" content="@yegor256"/> <meta name="twitter:title" property="og:title" content="16 Don'ts of Career Growth"/> <meta name="twitter:description" property="og:description" content="&lt;p&gt;I get questions like this all the time: How does one become a senior software developer or an architect? How does one grow from a junior just starting to write Java code to the leader of a software team that is driving a BMW and making $150K+ per year? What are the exact steps that won’t waste time and will get you there faster? Let me share what I think might be helpful.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;!--more--&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;jb_picture&quot;&gt;&lt;img itemprop=&quot;image&quot; alt=&quot;The Grand Budapest Hotel (2014) by Wes Anderson&quot; src=&quot;/images/2017/01/the-grand-budapest-hotel.jpg&quot; longdesc=&quot;#3c7b6134&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption id=&quot;3c7b6134&quot;&gt;The Grand Budapest Hotel (2014) by Wes Anderson&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Before writing this, I &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/webhp?q=career%20advice%20software%20developer&quot;&gt;Googled&lt;/a&gt; a bit and found a lot of interesting suggestions, like to be helpful, make friends, be language agnostic, code a lot, try to prove your bosses wrong, avoid conflicts, exercise, etc. Some of them are good, while others are very wrong, but most of them are just too far away from the main point.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I want to share what I believe will look more or less like explicit instructions of what to do tomorrow to become a $100-per-hour software architect in a few years. Well, they worked and keep working for me.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t Be Loyal&lt;/strong&gt;. The company you are working for at the moment is just a training ground, nothing else. Don’t invest an &lt;del&gt;extra&lt;/del&gt; minute of your time into it. Be selfish; think only about yourself and your personal skills, knowledge, and experience. They pay you to be dedicated and loyal? Well, that’s their fault. Use them to learn new technologies, experiment with new ideas, train and educate yourself, get new certificates, meet new people, etc. They must work &lt;em&gt;for you&lt;/em&gt;, not the other way around.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;They pay you to be dedicated and loyal? Well, that's their fault.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t Work&lt;/strong&gt;. Make sure programming is your &lt;em&gt;hobby&lt;/em&gt;, not your job. Everything else must be secondary, including your family, friends, and WoW. Software engineering is your family, your passion, your friend, and your life. Without that attitude, you will always be a slave to those who think like that. You must not work; you must have fun in front of the laptop. More fun than you’re having anywhere else. Never do anything that is not fun. If you notice you’re writing some code because you “have to” instead of because “you want to,” stop immediately. Something is going wrong and you’re shooting yourself in the foot; your career is in trouble.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t Make Friends&lt;/strong&gt;. I’m talking about professional relationships in the office, within your projects, at the company you’re working for. Remember that 99 percent of people will not become experts. They will remain who they are—regular programmers with no passion or ambition. What’s really bad for you is that they will want you to stay &lt;em&gt;with them&lt;/em&gt;. Nobody will enjoy seeing your growth, and your closest friends will become your enemies. Not explicitly, but subconsciously they will do everything they can to prevent you from getting better and leaving them. And you will have to leave them if you grow up. To avoid all that, stay professional and don’t make friends at work.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Nobody will enjoy seeing your growth, and your closest friends will become your enemies.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t Be Helpful&lt;/strong&gt;. There are more than 10 million programmers in the world. They all need help. Why do you need to help that dude sitting next to you in the office? You won’t save the world by helping people around you—forget that religious nonsense. If you really want to do good for the software industry, focus on bigger things: make an open source product, write a book, or improve the documentation of the project you are working on. By &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/02/16/it-is-not-a-school.html&quot;&gt;helping&lt;/a&gt; people around you and solving &lt;em&gt;their&lt;/em&gt; problems, you just cripple them, nothing else.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t Ask for Help&lt;/strong&gt;. Expect the same attitude from programmers around you. Again, the same argument applies: There are &lt;a href=&quot;https://sostats.github.io/&quot;&gt;more than 6 million accounts&lt;/a&gt; registered on the StackExchange platform; if you need help, ask them. Don’t ask your friends or colleagues. Train yourself to get help from public sources or from your project documentation. By asking people around you, you’re making your life easier in the short term only. In the long run, you will lack that important skill of knowing how to find information. You will become a hostage to those friends who help you. Also, don’t learn from people around you; learn from books, StackOverflow, and open source software.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;You must be prepared to say &quot;No&quot; to your friends, your family, your habits, your wishes, your projects, colleagues, classes, methods, and lines of code.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t Waste Time&lt;/strong&gt;. This is probably the most important advice, which I have to give myself first of all—unfortunately, I waste a lot of time. Any growth is always about saying “No.” You must be prepared to say it to your friends, your family, your habits, your wishes, your projects, colleagues, classes, methods, and lines of code. Stop the projects that are taking time and giving nothing back. Don’t call back those whom you don’t need. Yes, they need you, but you don’t need them. This may sound harsh and selfish, but that’s the only way to get where you want to be. Time is your main resource; be very greedy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t Skimp on Growth&lt;/strong&gt;. You must invest into yourself. First of all, you have to buy books. Don’t steal them, even though &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/11/09/why-no-ebooks.html&quot;&gt;you can&lt;/a&gt;. Buy them, spending your &lt;em&gt;own&lt;/em&gt; money. You will take them way more serious. You will respect yourself for owning the library. You will feel that software engineering is forever with you; it’s not temporary, it’s not just a job, it’s your life. Two books per month is your absolute minimum. Second, pay for certificates for the same reasons. Third, purchase software; don’t steal it. Finally, don’t be cheap on your laptop. It is much more important than your car or a birthday gift for your spouse. Your laptop is your instrument; it must be &lt;del&gt;good and expensive&lt;/del&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;/2017/06/27/my-environment.html&quot;&gt;made by Apple&lt;/a&gt;. You must go “all in” if you want to win.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t Work Full-Time&lt;/strong&gt;. As much as possible, try to stay away from full-time, 9-to-5 jobs—they pause your professional growth. Permanent or long-term employment gives you a stable income, a comfortable office environment, a predictable set of technical problems to solve, and the ability to become an expert over a small territory. At the same time, it takes away &lt;em&gt;fear&lt;/em&gt;. That’s right, fear. You are not afraid anymore, and that’s why you stop growing. To grow and grow fast, you must always be challenged by new tasks, new teams, new projects, and new job interviews. You must always prove that you are worth something. Ideally, you must work on two to three projects part-time and change them every 6 to 12 months.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t Be Cheap&lt;/strong&gt;. Forget the stories that teach “money is not everything, and an interesting project is much more important”—they are for losers. Money &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/09/24/why-monetary-awards-dont-work.html&quot;&gt;is everything&lt;/a&gt;. An interesting project will be &lt;em&gt;properly&lt;/em&gt; funded. If it’s not funded, the market doesn’t need it. What are you doing there then? The only answer is that you’re not as good as &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/10/29/how-much-do-you-cost.html&quot;&gt;others&lt;/a&gt;; that’s how they managed to buy you. My advice is to never pay attention to those cheap stories; &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/01/12/good-programmers-dont-work-for-equity.html&quot;&gt;demand cash&lt;/a&gt;, up front, as much as possible.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t Be Skeptical About Certifications&lt;/strong&gt;. Many programmers think certifications are not important now because they don’t really validate anything and are issued simply for money by big companies. Don’t think like that. Certifications help you formalize your knowledge, put borders around it, and remove gaps. And they demonstrate to most of your potential employers that you’re truly &lt;em&gt;serious&lt;/em&gt; about software engineering.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t Ignore Management&lt;/strong&gt;.

To move higher in that hierarchy, you must understand &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/05/24/who-is-project-manager.html&quot;&gt;project management&lt;/a&gt;. And it’s not just being nice to people and wearing a suit. It’s a science, with a lot of rules, principles, methods, and best practices. You must study them and become very good at them. Just as good as you are in Java or C++. Start with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Management_Body_of_Knowledge&quot;&gt;PMBOK&lt;/a&gt; and earn your &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Management_Professional&quot;&gt;PMP&lt;/a&gt; certification.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t Underestimate English&lt;/strong&gt;.

class="unprintable"><p>I get questions like this all the time: How does one become a senior software developer or an architect? How does one grow from a junior just starting to write Java code to the leader of a software team that is driving a BMW and making $150K+ per year? What are the exact steps that won’t waste time and will get you there faster? Let me share what I think might be helpful.</p><figure class="jb_picture"><img itemprop="image" alt="The Grand Budapest Hotel (2014) by Wes Anderson" src="/images/2017/01/the-grand-budapest-hotel.jpg" longdesc="#3c7b6134" /><figcaption id="3c7b6134">The Grand Budapest Hotel (2014) by Wes Anderson</figcaption></figure><p>Before writing this, I <a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?q=career%20advice%20software%20developer">Googled</a> a bit and found a lot of interesting suggestions, like to be helpful, make friends, be language agnostic, code a lot, try to prove your bosses wrong, avoid conflicts, exercise, etc. Some of them are good, while others are very wrong, but most of them are just too far away from the main point.</p><p>I want to share what I believe will look more or less like explicit instructions of what to do tomorrow to become a $100-per-hour software architect in a few years. Well, they worked and keep working for me.</p><p><strong>Don’t Be Loyal</strong>. The company you are working for at the moment is just a training ground, nothing else. Don’t invest an <del>extra</del> minute of your time into it. Be selfish; think only about yourself and your personal skills, knowledge, and experience. They pay you to be dedicated and loyal? Well, that’s their fault. Use them to learn new technologies, experiment with new ideas, train and educate yourself, get new certificates, meet new people, etc. They must work <em>for you</em>, not the other way around.</p><aside class="quote">They pay you to be dedicated and loyal? Well, that's their fault.</aside><p><strong>Don’t Work</strong>. Make sure programming is your <em>hobby</em>, not your job. Everything else must be secondary, including your family, friends, and WoW. Software engineering is your family, your passion, your friend, and your life. Without that attitude, you will always be a slave to those who think like that. You must not work; you must have fun in front of the laptop. More fun than you’re having anywhere else. Never do anything that is not fun. If you notice you’re writing some code because you “have to” instead of because “you want to,” stop immediately. Something is going wrong and you’re shooting yourself in the foot; your career is in trouble.</p><p><strong>Don’t Make Friends</strong>. I’m talking about professional relationships in the office, within your projects, at the company you’re working for. Remember that 99 percent of people will not become experts. They will remain who they are—regular programmers with no passion or ambition. What’s really bad for you is that they will want you to stay <em>with them</em>. Nobody will enjoy seeing your growth, and your closest friends will become your enemies. Not explicitly, but subconsciously they will do everything they can to prevent you from getting better and leaving them. And you will have to leave them if you grow up. To avoid all that, stay professional and don’t make friends at work.</p><aside class="quote">Nobody will enjoy seeing your growth, and your closest friends will become your enemies.</aside><p><strong>Don’t Be Helpful</strong>. There are more than 10 million programmers in the world. They all need help. Why do you need to help that dude sitting next to you in the office? You won’t save the world by helping people around you—forget that religious nonsense. If you really want to do good for the software industry, focus on bigger things: make an open source product, write a book, or improve the documentation of the project you are working on. By <a href="/2015/02/16/it-is-not-a-school.html">helping</a> people around you and solving <em>their</em> problems, you just cripple them, nothing else.</p><p><strong>Don’t Ask for Help</strong>. Expect the same attitude from programmers around you. Again, the same argument applies: There are <a href="https://sostats.github.io/">more than 6 million accounts</a> registered on the StackExchange platform; if you need help, ask them. Don’t ask your friends or colleagues. Train yourself to get help from public sources or from your project documentation. By asking people around you, you’re making your life easier in the short term only. In the long run, you will lack that important skill of knowing how to find information. You will become a hostage to those friends who help you. Also, don’t learn from people around you; learn from books, StackOverflow, and open source software.</p><aside class="quote">You must be prepared to say "No" to your friends, your family, your habits, your wishes, your projects, colleagues, classes, methods, and lines of code.</aside><p><strong>Don’t Waste Time</strong>. This is probably the most important advice, which I have to give myself first of all—unfortunately, I waste a lot of time. Any growth is always about saying “No.” You must be prepared to say it to your friends, your family, your habits, your wishes, your projects, colleagues, classes, methods, and lines of code. Stop the projects that are taking time and giving nothing back. Don’t call back those whom you don’t need. Yes, they need you, but you don’t need them. This may sound harsh and selfish, but that’s the only way to get where you want to be. Time is your main resource; be very greedy.</p><p><strong>Don’t Skimp on Growth</strong>. You must invest into yourself. First of all, you have to buy books. Don’t steal them, even though <a href="/2016/11/09/why-no-ebooks.html">you can</a>. Buy them, spending your <em>own</em> money. You will take them way more serious. You will respect yourself for owning the library. You will feel that software engineering is forever with you; it’s not temporary, it’s not just a job, it’s your life. Two books per month is your absolute minimum. Second, pay for certificates for the same reasons. Third, purchase software; don’t steal it. Finally, don’t be cheap on your laptop. It is much more important than your car or a birthday gift for your spouse. Your laptop is your instrument; it must be <del>good and expensive</del> <a href="/2017/06/27/my-environment.html">made by Apple</a>. You must go “all in” if you want to win.</p><p><strong>Don’t Work Full-Time</strong>. As much as possible, try to stay away from full-time, 9-to-5 jobs—they pause your professional growth. Permanent or long-term employment gives you a stable income, a comfortable office environment, a predictable set of technical problems to solve, and the ability to become an expert over a small territory. At the same time, it takes away <em>fear</em>. That’s right, fear. You are not afraid anymore, and that’s why you stop growing. To grow and grow fast, you must always be challenged by new tasks, new teams, new projects, and new job interviews. You must always prove that you are worth something. Ideally, you must work on two to three projects part-time and change them every 6 to 12 months.</p><p><strong>Don’t Be Cheap</strong>. Forget the stories that teach “money is not everything, and an interesting project is much more important”—they are for losers. Money <a href="/2014/09/24/why-monetary-awards-dont-work.html">is everything</a>. An interesting project will be <em>properly</em> funded. If it’s not funded, the market doesn’t need it. What are you doing there then? The only answer is that you’re not as good as <a href="/2014/10/29/how-much-do-you-cost.html">others</a>; that’s how they managed to buy you. My advice is to never pay attention to those cheap stories; <a href="/2016/01/12/good-programmers-dont-work-for-equity.html">demand cash</a>, up front, as much as possible.</p><p><strong>Don’t Be Skeptical About Certifications</strong>. Many programmers think certifications are not important now because they don’t really validate anything and are issued simply for money by big companies. Don’t think like that. Certifications help you formalize your knowledge, put borders around it, and remove gaps. And they demonstrate to most of your potential employers that you’re truly <em>serious</em> about software engineering.</p><p><strong>Don’t Ignore Management</strong>. Being a good programmer is not the same as being a good architect or a team leader. To move higher in that hierarchy, you must understand <a href="/2016/05/24/who-is-project-manager.html">project management</a>. And it’s not just being nice to people and wearing a suit. It’s a science, with a lot of rules, principles, methods, and best practices. You must study them and become very good at them. Just as good as you are in Java or C++. Start with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Management_Body_of_Knowledge">PMBOK</a> and earn your <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Management_Professional">PMP</a> certification.</p><p><strong>Don’t Underestimate English</strong>. Most of my readers are not native English speakers, just like myself. I’m addressing this paragraph to you: You must improve your speaking and writing skills; it’s very important. You will never become an <a href="/2014/10/29/how-much-do-you-cost.html">expensive</a> software architect if you can’t speak and write well. And it can’t be Russian in English words. It must be as the English people talk in San Francisco, not in Moscow. The best advice to learn it: Watch English movies with subtitles. You must speak like Matt Damon or Al Pacino, but not like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0uM_xh7WOg&amp;t=29s">Mutko</a>.</p><p><strong>Don’t Ignore Open Source</strong>. You must be active in the open source community. It’s <a href="/2015/12/22/why-dont-you-contribute-to-open-source.html">a must</a>. You either have your own open source project or you actively contribute to an existing one. Either way, it’s crucial. Working in a closed <a href="/2015/10/06/how-to-be-good-office-slave.html">office environment</a> is one thing, while writing code that is visible to the entire world is a totally different thing. Most programmers are simply afraid of that, and they make up many excuses for why they are not there. Don’t be one of them. Yes, it’s difficult, it’s stressful, it will consume a lot of your private time, and nobody will pay you for it. Do it anyway—this is the fastest way to grow. Moreover, I would recommend you try to open as much source code as possible, even if you write it for private and commercial projects. Some companies won’t be against that.</p><aside class="quote">I should be able to Google your name and find a lot of professional links, not just your Tinder profile.</aside><p><strong>Don’t Be Invisible</strong>. Make sure you have Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and Instagram accounts, along with a blog. You must be present on the Internet. You’re a serious software architect? I should be able to Google your name and find a lot of professional links, not just your Tinder profile. And they will Google your name; don’t ever doubt that. My book <a href="/256-bloghacks.html">256 Bloghacks</a> may help you understand how to do it right.</p><p><strong>Don’t Stay Home</strong>. Attend seminars, meetups, and software conferences. At least once a month, you must go somewhere where other programmers are hanging out. You don’t need to be super active and make a lot of friends—just be there and watch. Eventually you will realize that it’s time to become a speaker. Remember that it doesn’t really matter how much your coworkers respect you. What matters is what the <em>market</em> thinks about you.</p><aside class="quote">Playing GTA 'til 3 a.m. is not what successful and happy software architects do.</aside><p><strong>Don’t Forget to Relax</strong>. Nobody likes those smelly dorks who only get one haircut per year. They will hire you and respect you as a coder, but they will never take you seriously as a candidate for a role with a lot of <del>money</del> responsibility. You will always look like a mentally unstable person. Instead, you must look “like business,” even though you are a geek. That’s why it’s very important to pay attention to how you spend your free time—how you relax. Playing GTA ‘til 3 a.m. is not what successful and happy software architects do. Instead, here is your short list of activities: sports, tourism, and night clubs. Be a normal person—that’s the point.</p><p>Did I miss anything important?</p></p><nav class="buttons notranslate desktop-only"> <a href="http://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://www.yegor256.com/2017/01/24/career-advice.html" title="Share on Facebook" class="button" rel="nofollow"> <span class="count count-facebook">0</span> <i class="icon icon-facebook notranslate" aria-hidden="true"></i> </a> <a href="https://twitter.com/share?url=https://www.yegor256.com/2017/01/24/career-advice.html&amp;text=16+Don%27ts+of+Career+Growth" title="Share on Twitter" class="button" rel="nofollow"> <span class="count count-twitter">0</span> <i class="icon icon-twitter notranslate" aria-hidden="true"></i> </a> <a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=https://www.yegor256.com/2017/01/24/career-advice.html" title="Share on Google+" class="button" rel="nofollow"> <span class="count count-googleplus">0</span> <i class="icon icon-googleplus notranslate" aria-hidden="true"></i> </a> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/cws/share?url=https://www.yegor256.com/2017/01/24/career-advice.html" title="Share on LinkedIn" class="button" rel="nofollow"> <span class="count count-linkedin">0</span> <i class="icon icon-linkedin notranslate" aria-hidden="true"></i> </a> <a href="http://reddit.com/submit?url=https://www.yegor256.com/2017/01/24/career-advice.html%3F2017-04&amp;title=16+Don%27ts+of+Career+Growth" title="Share on Reddit" class="button" rel="nofollow"> <span class="count count-reddit">0</span> <i class="icon icon-reddit notranslate" aria-hidden="true"></i> </a> <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/submitlink?u=https://www.yegor256.com/2017/01/24/career-advice.html%3F2017-04&amp;t=16+Don%27ts+of+Career+Growth" title="Share on Hacker News" class="button" rel="nofollow"> <span class="count count-hackernews">0</span> <i class="icon icon-hackernews notranslate" aria-hidden="true"></i> </a> </nav> </header> <article class="main" itemprop="articleBody"><div ><p>I get questions like this all the time: How does one become a senior software developer or an architect?

Make sure you have Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and Instagram accounts, along with a blog. You must be present on the Internet. You’re a serious software architect? I should be able to Google your name and find a lot of professional links, not just your Tinder profile. And they will Google your name; don’t ever doubt that. My book <a href="/256-bloghacks.html">256 Bloghacks</a> may help you understand how to do it right.</p><p><strong>Don’t Stay Home</strong>. Attend seminars, meetups, and software conferences. At least once a month, you must go somewhere where other programmers are hanging out. You don’t need to be super active and make a lot of friends—just be there and watch. Eventually you will realize that it’s time to become a speaker. Remember that it doesn’t really matter how much your coworkers respect you. What matters is what the <em>market</em> thinks about you.</p><aside class="quote">Playing GTA 'til 3 a.m. is not what successful and happy software architects do.</aside><p><strong>Don’t Forget to Relax</strong>. Nobody likes those smelly dorks who only get one haircut per year. They will hire you and respect you as a coder, but they will never take you seriously as a candidate for a role with a lot of <del>money</del> responsibility. You will always look like a mentally unstable person. Instead, you must look “like business,” even though you are a geek. That’s why it’s very important to pay attention to how you spend your free time—how you relax. Playing GTA ‘til 3 a.m. is not what successful and happy software architects do. Instead, here is your short list of activities: sports, tourism, and night clubs.

Literally, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=how+to+write+resume&quot;&gt;tons of them&lt;/a&gt;. And here’s yet another one? Well, maybe … but I don’t think so. I’ll try to give you a few &lt;em&gt;practical&lt;/em&gt; hints for how to make your resume look “sexier,” and how to position yourself beyond the “good programmer” category and into the superstar zone. It may take a few years to truly pimp up your CV, but when it’s done, you will charge &lt;a href=&quot;/2017/01/24/career-advice.html&quot;&gt;$100-plus per hour&lt;/a&gt; and face no hesitation from your clients in paying.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;!--more--&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;jb_picture&quot;&gt;&lt;img itemprop=&quot;image&quot; alt=&quot;Delicatessen (1991) by Jean-Pierre Jeunet&quot; src=&quot;/images/2016/03/delicatessen.jpg&quot; longdesc=&quot;#8b8ba58d&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption id=&quot;8b8ba58d&quot;&gt;Delicatessen (1991) by Jean-Pierre Jeunet&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;one-page-no-exceptions&quot;&gt;One Page, No Exceptions&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;I think it’s obvious, but only one out of 10 resumes I’ve been getting each day fits onto one page. All the others take three or more pages, and this looks very &lt;em&gt;unprofessional&lt;/em&gt;. If you can’t explain yourself in one page, there will be doubts about your skills in scope management, which are very important for a software engineer. It shows you simply can’t filter out what’s non-important and focus on what really matters. Besides, it’s just boring to read three pages.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thus, strictly limit yourself to one page, &lt;em&gt;no exceptions&lt;/em&gt;. Your resume is an “executive summary” of the product you’re trying to sell. It’s a marketing brochure. A sales flyer. A sticker on my refrigerator, if you wish. It has to be short and straightforward. Employers will either buy it or throw it away. They don’t want to read it; they want to buy you. Or throw your brochure away. Four-page brochures have far fewer chances than one-pagers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;dont-lie&quot;&gt;Don’t Lie&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;You can tell half of the truth, you can hide some information, and you can rephrase the truth, but never lie.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;No matter what you do with your resume, never lie about a single word. You can tell half of the truth, you can hide some information, and you can rephrase the truth, but never lie. You don’t know who is reading your CV and which desk it will end up on. Be ready to answer for every word you have on it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you’re saying that you’re an “expert in JavaScript,” be ready to explain what the key new features of ECMAScript version 6 are. If you can’t, don’t use the word “expert.” The point is that you have to be ready to prove every word.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;sexy-photo-on-the-top&quot;&gt;Sexy Photo on the Top&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;You want them to work with you, right? They want to see you. So a photo is a mandatory component of a CV. And try to make it look artistic. Ask your graphic designer friend to style it. Maybe even pay for this work. Just pay attention to the photo; it’s very important.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Do I have to say that you must smile on that photo? Well, yes, you must. And make it casual, with a T-shirt and funny background. You must look relaxed and successful. You don’t want to get hired; they want to hire you—this is the message your photo should send, just like in online &lt;em&gt;dating&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;skip-objective-and-title&quot;&gt;Skip “Objective” and “Title”&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Senior Software Developer,” “Seasoned Java Programmer,” “Talented IT Professional,” etc. It’s boring and doesn’t sell you at all. They know what you are, because they are reading your resume.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Besides that, you’re limiting yourself with that title. Maybe they are looking for a VP of engineering while your resume says “Software Architect.” That’s immediately a mismatch for them. It’s a strike against you. Your &lt;em&gt;name&lt;/em&gt; is the title of your resume. That’s it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;a-dozen-skills&quot;&gt;A Dozen Skills&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;This section of your resume actually tells them about your “tech focus.” It must have a very short list of skills, definitely &lt;em&gt;under 12&lt;/em&gt;. You simply can’t be an expert in MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and MS SQL at the same time. If there are too many skills, it’s a sign of a “jack of all trades” who is almost always a “master of none.” Don’t do that.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;If there are too many skills, it's a sign of a &quot;jack of all trades&quot; who is almost always a &quot;master of none.&quot;&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;Find the most important skills in your profile and put them there. Just a few. And make sure the skills are all on the same level of abstraction. Java and AngularJS must not be present together. Java is a few levels higher than AngularJS. Thus, it’s either “Java, SQL, and HTTP” or “AngularJS, Spring Framework, and Web Sockets.” I would recommend you stay at the lowest level you can until you become a serious market figure. For example, “Java” as a skill would look good in &lt;a href=&quot;http://stackoverflow.com/users/22656/jon-skeet&quot;&gt;Jon Skeet&lt;/a&gt;’s resume, because he definitely knows the entire Java world, and the market has recognized that. But if you’re a programmer with just three years of experience, how can you “know Java?” You barely know a few hundred classes from it. That’s why it’s better to state specifically which parts of Java you definitely know. Like I said, be as low-level and specific in your skills as possible.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;stackoverflow-profile&quot;&gt;StackOverflow Profile&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;No matter what anyone &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/10/29/how-much-do-you-cost.html&quot;&gt;says&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;/2017/02/14/stackoverflow-is-your-tool.html&quot;&gt;StackOverflow&lt;/a&gt; is the de-facto standard platform for asking and answering technical questions. Your presence there and your high rating send a clear message to your potential employer that you’re a superstar (or a rising one). No so many people have 100K or more reputation points there. You must be one of them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So even if you don’t have a StackOverflow profile now, create one. Spend one hour on it every day for a few months, answering &lt;a href=&quot;http://stackoverflow.com/?tab=interesting&quot;&gt;new questions&lt;/a&gt;. You will earn 1,000 or more reputation points. Well, provided you have something to say. That’s enough for a start. Post a link to your profile right in your resume.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Even if you don’t have much to say, be there. Read answers made by others, comment on them, try to help them, and correct them. Become an active part of the community.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;github-profile&quot;&gt;GitHub Profile&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;GitHub is the de-facto standard platform for open source code. There are others like BitBucket, but—I hope—they will die sooner or later. As a modern software developer, you must be on GitHub. You &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/12/22/why-dont-you-contribute-to-open-source.html&quot;&gt;have to contribute&lt;/a&gt; to some open source. You have to be visible in the open source world if you want to sell yourself high.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;You don't have to spend all your time on open source projects, just contribute to the ones you're using already.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;Your potential employer wants to see what the &lt;em&gt;market&lt;/em&gt; is thinking about your code and about you. They are afraid of making a mistake by hiring you. Your presence in the open source world is a &lt;em&gt;guarantee&lt;/em&gt; for them. Someone has already seen your code, and someone has already given some kudos to your projects. Someone virtually vouches for you. As a result, they will feel more comfortable in hiring you.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To be in the “elite,” you don’t have to spend all your time on open source projects. Just contribute to the ones you’re using already. You’re using Sinatra at work? Check its source code. You will find a lot of places that need improvement. Offer them your help and simply submit small pull requests here and there. Besides that, create your own products and market them. You will be surprised by how many users and followers you will attract in just a few years of such activity.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;certificates&quot;&gt;Certificates&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some may say they are not important. Maybe so. But your resume must have them. Some of them are not so difficult to get. With just a few weeks of study and a few hundred dollars, you are not just a Java programmer but a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_Certification_Program&quot;&gt;certified&lt;/a&gt; one. And there are not so many of those out there. There are millions of Java coders in the world, but only a few percent of them are certified. Regardless of whether you think it’s important or not, get those certifications.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As many as you like. But stay away from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.brainbench.com/&quot;&gt;BrainBench&lt;/a&gt; and similar sites. Well, you can get certified there, but don’t put them into your resume. That will only demonstrate that you are proud of a very questionable achievement. It’s not a good sign.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;sound-names-and-numbers&quot;&gt;Sound Names and Numbers&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s a dangerous trick, so be careful. Here is how it works. You have to go through your entire professional history and find well-known names or big numbers. For example, 10 years ago I was helping a startup create software that had IBM as a subscriber. They managed to get some tracking, and in two months, IBM decided not to use them anymore. It’s a true (and sad) story, but I can put something like this into my resume: “wrote software for IBM.” Am I lying? Not really. If they ask me what exactly I did for IBM, I will explain. In most cases, they won’t ask. They will just buy this big name and put my resume on top of others.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You can do the same with numbers. Here is another true story. A few years ago, I was helping a company configure a continuous integration pipeline. It was not a big deal, but the company was serving more than 5 million hits per day on its website. That’s a big number. I had nothing to do with this substantial web traffic, but I was in that company for a few months. So I may say in my resume: “configured the delivery pipeline for a 5M-hits-per-day web store.” If they ask me for details, I will be able to give them. I’m not lying.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Use this technique carefully, and never lie. But do it. Don’t be scared. Your resume needs big names and numbers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;blog&quot;&gt;Blog&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Create your own blog. Start writing. About what? About your everyday achievements. About the code you write and read. About what you observe in the office. About your thoughts and your plans. About the books you read. You absolutely need to have a blog if you want to position yourself as an expensive software engineer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It doesn’t need to be a very popular blog; don’t focus on numbers. But it has to be properly created, designed, and hosted. Don’t use &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wordpress.com&quot;&gt;WordPress&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.blogger.com&quot;&gt;Blogger&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tumblr.com&quot;&gt;Tumblr&lt;/a&gt;. Instead, I would recommend you think about static site generators like &lt;a href=&quot;https://jekyllrb.com/&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt; and host it all on &lt;a href=&quot;https://pages.github.com/&quot;&gt;GitHub Pages&lt;/a&gt;. That’s what I’m doing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Besides being a valuable addition to your resume, systematic and regular writing will help you structure your thoughts, plans, and decisions. Well, that’s what I’m getting from my blog.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;ambitions&quot;&gt;Ambitions&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you’re young and your resume is not full of bright achievements yet, you can add “ambitions” section to it. There you say what you’re planning to achieve, to impress your future employer. For example: “learn Go,” “create a new open source CSS framework,” “write a book,” or “earn Oracle Java certification next year.” This will demonstrate that even though you’re young, you do care about your career and professional growth.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;education&quot;&gt;Education&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;I would limit yourself to a few letters in this area. Just “MSc” or “BSc” is enough. There’s no need to say when you graduated and from which school. You can give those details later. Well, there are just two exceptions to this rule.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;First, if you’re a PhD, put that on top of your CV. It’s important, and it’s valuable, simply because there are not so many of them among programmers. Second is if your school is Stanford, MIT, or something similar. If that’s the case, also put it on top of your CV.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In all other situations, just write “BSc” and that’s it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;conferences&quot;&gt;Conferences&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Every year, you must give a few presentations at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.oracle.com/javaone/index.html&quot;&gt;JavaOne&lt;/a&gt;. I’m kidding. About the JavaOne part, anyway. But the “every year” part is very true. You must regularly make some speeches somewhere, preferably at JavaOne. But until you get there, speak where you can. Well, where they accept you. Create a profile at &lt;a href=&quot;http://lanyrd.com&quot;&gt;lanyrd&lt;/a&gt; (or something similar) and regularly check which conferences are looking for speakers. Submit there and you will be surprised to see that a few of them will actually accept some of your ideas.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The easiest subjects to start with are stories about your practical experience with some modern technologies and tools, something like “How Docker Helps Us Optimize Delivery” or “Five Apache Spark Installation Issues.” Just describe what you’ve done on a recent project. It doesn’t really matter what you talk about. What matters is that you’re visible. If the market accepts you, the employer will trust you more. That’s exactly what you need in order to request a higher rate.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;career-history&quot;&gt;Career History&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;I’ll be speaking for myself here. As an employer, I don’t really care about your history at all. Moreover, if you have never worked anywhere full-time, I would probably be more interested in working with you. But that’s just me, because I truly believe that modern offices and full-time jobs turn programmers into &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/10/06/how-to-be-good-office-slave.html&quot;&gt;slaves&lt;/a&gt; (and not only programmers).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Other employers may think differently. Well, they most likely think differently. That’s why you have to demonstrate with which offices you’ve spent 10 recent years of your life. I would recommend you keep this list short. Even if you’ve changed eight companies over the last two years, don’t say that. Just three places is enough. That will show them you’re a good slave—very loyal to previous masters. That’s what they want to see, because they are planning to buy you and become your next master. Right? Sounds harsh? Isn’t &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/07/21/hourly-pay-modern-slavery.html&quot;&gt;it true&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Also, your experience section must mention your achievements, not your duties. Instead of “managing 300+ AWS nodes” or “building mobile apps” it’s better to say “created 300+ AWS nodes infrastructure” or “built a few mobile apps.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;acm-ieee-jug-and-other-memberships&quot;&gt;ACM, IEEE, JUG, and Other Memberships&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;These memberships mean literally nothing but will demonstrate that you are part of those communities. Just like with most other things mentioned above, employers will trust you more if the market already trusts you. These memberships don’t really mean that anyone has recognized you, since you get them just by paying annual fees. But still, you’re paying those fees, and most other applicants aren’t. You’re definitely more reliable than many others.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;mention-hobbies&quot;&gt;Mention Hobbies&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;I think information about hobbies is important. Some say it’s not, but I believe that a personal “click” between you and your potential employer plays an important role. There is a human on that side. He or she is reading your CV, and he or she wants to like you—mostly in order to be comfortable making a hiring decision. Help him or her like you faster. Mention that you enjoy skiing, monkey-feeding in the zoo, and Jimmy Kimmel. Be creative, not boring. Just like you do in online dating.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;layoutgraphics&quot;&gt;Layout/Graphics&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;How should your one page look? Stand out! It must express your personality. Don’t use the “resume templates” downloadable for free. Create your own layout and design. If you’re not a designer, ask your Photoshop friend to do it for you. Actually, there is not much to do; just select the right font and add a few colors here and there.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This CV is your product. You made it. It’s your baby. If it’s just a Word document in a standard template, they will feel you didn’t pay attention to it. You didn’t even care to create that small but very important product nicely. How will you create their software? With the same attitude. Don’t ruin the whole show with a careless design. That’s the key word here—“careless.” It doesn’t need to be complex. It may be very simple. But it must be &lt;em&gt;yours&lt;/em&gt;, made with care and love.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;hr /&gt; &lt;p&gt;Want free advice on your resume? Send it to &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:cv@yegor256.com&quot;&gt;cv@yegor256.com&lt;/a&gt;, and I’ll let you know what I think. I will reply to all emails, but be ready to hear mostly what’s wrong.

It may take a few years to truly pimp up your CV, but when it’s done, you will charge &lt;a href=&quot;/2017/01/24/career-advice.html&quot;&gt;$100-plus per hour&lt;/a&gt; and face no hesitation from your clients in paying.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;!--more--&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;jb_picture&quot;&gt;&lt;img itemprop=&quot;image&quot; alt=&quot;Delicatessen (1991) by Jean-Pierre Jeunet&quot; src=&quot;/images/2016/03/delicatessen.jpg&quot; longdesc=&quot;#8b8ba58d&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption id=&quot;8b8ba58d&quot;&gt;Delicatessen (1991) by Jean-Pierre Jeunet&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;one-page-no-exceptions&quot;&gt;One Page, No Exceptions&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;I think it’s obvious, but only one out of 10 resumes I’ve been getting each day fits onto one page. All the others take three or more pages, and this looks very &lt;em&gt;unprofessional&lt;/em&gt;. If you can’t explain yourself in one page, there will be doubts about your skills in scope management, which are very important for a software engineer. It shows you simply can’t filter out what’s non-important and focus on what really matters. Besides, it’s just boring to read three pages.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thus, strictly limit yourself to one page, &lt;em&gt;no exceptions&lt;/em&gt;. Your resume is an “executive summary” of the product you’re trying to sell. It’s a marketing brochure. A sales flyer. A sticker on my refrigerator, if you wish. It has to be short and straightforward. Employers will either buy it or throw it away. They don’t want to read it; they want to buy you. Or throw your brochure away. Four-page brochures have far fewer chances than one-pagers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;dont-lie&quot;&gt;Don’t Lie&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;You can tell half of the truth, you can hide some information, and you can rephrase the truth, but never lie.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;No matter what you do with your resume, never lie about a single word. You can tell half of the truth, you can hide some information, and you can rephrase the truth, but never lie. You don’t know who is reading your CV and which desk it will end up on. Be ready to answer for every word you have on it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you’re saying that you’re an “expert in JavaScript,” be ready to explain what the key new features of ECMAScript version 6 are. If you can’t, don’t use the word “expert.” The point is that you have to be ready to prove every word.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;sexy-photo-on-the-top&quot;&gt;Sexy Photo on the Top&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;You want them to work with you, right? They want to see you. So a photo is a mandatory component of a CV. And try to make it look artistic. Ask your graphic designer friend to style it. Maybe even pay for this work. Just pay attention to the photo; it’s very important.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Do I have to say that you must smile on that photo? Well, yes, you must. And make it casual, with a T-shirt and funny background. You must look relaxed and successful. You don’t want to get hired; they want to hire you—this is the message your photo should send, just like in online &lt;em&gt;dating&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;skip-objective-and-title&quot;&gt;Skip “Objective” and “Title”&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Senior Software Developer,” “Seasoned Java Programmer,” “Talented IT Professional,” etc. It’s boring and doesn’t sell you at all. They know what you are, because they are reading your resume.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Besides that, you’re limiting yourself with that title. Maybe they are looking for a VP of engineering while your resume says “Software Architect.” That’s immediately a mismatch for them. It’s a strike against you. Your &lt;em&gt;name&lt;/em&gt; is the title of your resume. That’s it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;a-dozen-skills&quot;&gt;A Dozen Skills&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;This section of your resume actually tells them about your “tech focus.” It must have a very short list of skills, definitely &lt;em&gt;under 12&lt;/em&gt;. You simply can’t be an expert in MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and MS SQL at the same time. If there are too many skills, it’s a sign of a “jack of all trades” who is almost always a “master of none.” Don’t do that.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;If there are too many skills, it's a sign of a &quot;jack of all trades&quot; who is almost always a &quot;master of none.&quot;&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;Find the most important skills in your profile and put them there. Just a few. And make sure the skills are all on the same level of abstraction. Java and AngularJS must not be present together. Java is a few levels higher than AngularJS. Thus, it’s either “Java, SQL, and HTTP” or “AngularJS, Spring Framework, and Web Sockets.” I would recommend you stay at the lowest level you can until you become a serious market figure. For example, “Java” as a skill would look good in &lt;a href=&quot;http://stackoverflow.com/users/22656/jon-skeet&quot;&gt;Jon Skeet&lt;/a&gt;’s resume, because he definitely knows the entire Java world, and the market has recognized that. But if you’re a programmer with just three years of experience, how can you “know Java?” You barely know a few hundred classes from it. That’s why it’s better to state specifically which parts of Java you definitely know. Like I said, be as low-level and specific in your skills as possible.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;stackoverflow-profile&quot;&gt;StackOverflow Profile&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;No matter what anyone &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/10/29/how-much-do-you-cost.html&quot;&gt;says&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;/2017/02/14/stackoverflow-is-your-tool.html&quot;&gt;StackOverflow&lt;/a&gt; is the de-facto standard platform for asking and answering technical questions. Your presence there and your high rating send a clear message to your potential employer that you’re a superstar (or a rising one). No so many people have 100K or more reputation points there. You must be one of them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So even if you don’t have a StackOverflow profile now, create one. Spend one hour on it every day for a few months, answering &lt;a href=&quot;http://stackoverflow.com/?tab=interesting&quot;&gt;new questions&lt;/a&gt;. You will earn 1,000 or more reputation points. Well, provided you have something to say. That’s enough for a start. Post a link to your profile right in your resume.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Even if you don’t have much to say, be there. Read answers made by others, comment on them, try to help them, and correct them. Become an active part of the community.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;github-profile&quot;&gt;GitHub Profile&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;GitHub is the de-facto standard platform for open source code. There are others like BitBucket, but—I hope—they will die sooner or later. As a modern software developer, you must be on GitHub. You &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/12/22/why-dont-you-contribute-to-open-source.html&quot;&gt;have to contribute&lt;/a&gt; to some open source. You have to be visible in the open source world if you want to sell yourself high.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;You don't have to spend all your time on open source projects, just contribute to the ones you're using already.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;Your potential employer wants to see what the &lt;em&gt;market&lt;/em&gt; is thinking about your code and about you. They are afraid of making a mistake by hiring you. Your presence in the open source world is a &lt;em&gt;guarantee&lt;/em&gt; for them. Someone has already seen your code, and someone has already given some kudos to your projects. Someone virtually vouches for you. As a result, they will feel more comfortable in hiring you.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To be in the “elite,” you don’t have to spend all your time on open source projects. Just contribute to the ones you’re using already. You’re using Sinatra at work? Check its source code. You will find a lot of places that need improvement. Offer them your help and simply submit small pull requests here and there. Besides that, create your own products and market them. You will be surprised by how many users and followers you will attract in just a few years of such activity.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;certificates&quot;&gt;Certificates&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some may say they are not important. Maybe so. But your resume must have them. Some of them are not so difficult to get. With just a few weeks of study and a few hundred dollars, you are not just a Java programmer but a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_Certification_Program&quot;&gt;certified&lt;/a&gt; one. And there are not so many of those out there. There are millions of Java coders in the world, but only a few percent of them are certified. Regardless of whether you think it’s important or not, get those certifications.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As many as you like. But stay away from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.brainbench.com/&quot;&gt;BrainBench&lt;/a&gt; and similar sites. Well, you can get certified there, but don’t put them into your resume. That will only demonstrate that you are proud of a very questionable achievement. It’s not a good sign.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;sound-names-and-numbers&quot;&gt;Sound Names and Numbers&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s a dangerous trick, so be careful. Here is how it works. You have to go through your entire professional history and find well-known names or big numbers. For example, 10 years ago I was helping a startup create software that had IBM as a subscriber. They managed to get some tracking, and in two months, IBM decided not to use them anymore. It’s a true (and sad) story, but I can put something like this into my resume: “wrote software for IBM.” Am I lying? Not really. If they ask me what exactly I did for IBM, I will explain. In most cases, they won’t ask. They will just buy this big name and put my resume on top of others.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You can do the same with numbers. Here is another true story. A few years ago, I was helping a company configure a continuous integration pipeline. It was not a big deal, but the company was serving more than 5 million hits per day on its website. That’s a big number. I had nothing to do with this substantial web traffic, but I was in that company for a few months. So I may say in my resume: “configured the delivery pipeline for a 5M-hits-per-day web store.” If they ask me for details, I will be able to give them. I’m not lying.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Use this technique carefully, and never lie. But do it. Don’t be scared. Your resume needs big names and numbers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;blog&quot;&gt;Blog&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Create your own blog. Start writing. About what? About your everyday achievements. About the code you write and read. About what you observe in the office. About your thoughts and your plans. About the books you read. You absolutely need to have a blog if you want to position yourself as an expensive software engineer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It doesn’t need to be a very popular blog; don’t focus on numbers. But it has to be properly created, designed, and hosted. Don’t use &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wordpress.com&quot;&gt;WordPress&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.blogger.com&quot;&gt;Blogger&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tumblr.com&quot;&gt;Tumblr&lt;/a&gt;. Instead, I would recommend you think about static site generators like &lt;a href=&quot;https://jekyllrb.com/&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt; and host it all on &lt;a href=&quot;https://pages.github.com/&quot;&gt;GitHub Pages&lt;/a&gt;. That’s what I’m doing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Besides being a valuable addition to your resume, systematic and regular writing will help you structure your thoughts, plans, and decisions. Well, that’s what I’m getting from my blog.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;ambitions&quot;&gt;Ambitions&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you’re young and your resume is not full of bright achievements yet, you can add “ambitions” section to it. There you say what you’re planning to achieve, to impress your future employer. For example: “learn Go,” “create a new open source CSS framework,” “write a book,” or “earn Oracle Java certification next year.” This will demonstrate that even though you’re young, you do care about your career and professional growth.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;education&quot;&gt;Education&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;I would limit yourself to a few letters in this area. Just “MSc” or “BSc” is enough. There’s no need to say when you graduated and from which school. You can give those details later. Well, there are just two exceptions to this rule.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;First, if you’re a PhD, put that on top of your CV. It’s important, and it’s valuable, simply because there are not so many of them among programmers. Second is if your school is Stanford, MIT, or something similar. If that’s the case, also put it on top of your CV.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In all other situations, just write “BSc” and that’s it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;conferences&quot;&gt;Conferences&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Every year, you must give a few presentations at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.oracle.com/javaone/index.html&quot;&gt;JavaOne&lt;/a&gt;. I’m kidding. About the JavaOne part, anyway. But the “every year” part is very true. You must regularly make some speeches somewhere, preferably at JavaOne. But until you get there, speak where you can. Well, where they accept you. Create a profile at &lt;a href=&quot;http://lanyrd.com&quot;&gt;lanyrd&lt;/a&gt; (or something similar) and regularly check which conferences are looking for speakers. Submit there and you will be surprised to see that a few of them will actually accept some of your ideas.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The easiest subjects to start with are stories about your practical experience with some modern technologies and tools, something like “How Docker Helps Us Optimize Delivery” or “Five Apache Spark Installation Issues.” Just describe what you’ve done on a recent project. It doesn’t really matter what you talk about. What matters is that you’re visible. If the market accepts you, the employer will trust you more. That’s exactly what you need in order to request a higher rate.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;career-history&quot;&gt;Career History&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;I’ll be speaking for myself here. As an employer, I don’t really care about your history at all. Moreover, if you have never worked anywhere full-time, I would probably be more interested in working with you. But that’s just me, because I truly believe that modern offices and full-time jobs turn programmers into &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/10/06/how-to-be-good-office-slave.html&quot;&gt;slaves&lt;/a&gt; (and not only programmers).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Other employers may think differently. Well, they most likely think differently. That’s why you have to demonstrate with which offices you’ve spent 10 recent years of your life. I would recommend you keep this list short. Even if you’ve changed eight companies over the last two years, don’t say that. Just three places is enough. That will show them you’re a good slave—very loyal to previous masters. That’s what they want to see, because they are planning to buy you and become your next master. Right? Sounds harsh? Isn’t &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/07/21/hourly-pay-modern-slavery.html&quot;&gt;it true&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Also, your experience section must mention your achievements, not your duties. Instead of “managing 300+ AWS nodes” or “building mobile apps” it’s better to say “created 300+ AWS nodes infrastructure” or “built a few mobile apps.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;acm-ieee-jug-and-other-memberships&quot;&gt;ACM, IEEE, JUG, and Other Memberships&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;These memberships mean literally nothing but will demonstrate that you are part of those communities. Just like with most other things mentioned above, employers will trust you more if the market already trusts you. These memberships don’t really mean that anyone has recognized you, since you get them just by paying annual fees. But still, you’re paying those fees, and most other applicants aren’t. You’re definitely more reliable than many others.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;mention-hobbies&quot;&gt;Mention Hobbies&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;I think information about hobbies is important. Some say it’s not, but I believe that a personal “click” between you and your potential employer plays an important role. There is a human on that side. He or she is reading your CV, and he or she wants to like you—mostly in order to be comfortable making a hiring decision. Help him or her like you faster. Mention that you enjoy skiing, monkey-feeding in the zoo, and Jimmy Kimmel. Be creative, not boring. Just like you do in online dating.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;layoutgraphics&quot;&gt;Layout/Graphics&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;How should your one page look? Stand out! It must express your personality. Don’t use the “resume templates” downloadable for free. Create your own layout and design. If you’re not a designer, ask your Photoshop friend to do it for you. Actually, there is not much to do; just select the right font and add a few colors here and there.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This CV is your product. You made it. It’s your baby. If it’s just a Word document in a standard template, they will feel you didn’t pay attention to it. You didn’t even care to create that small but very important product nicely. How will you create their software? With the same attitude. Don’t ruin the whole show with a careless design. That’s the key word here—“careless.” It doesn’t need to be complex. It may be very simple. But it must be &lt;em&gt;yours&lt;/em&gt;, made with care and love.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;hr /&gt; &lt;p&gt;Want free advice on your resume? Send it to &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:cv@yegor256.com&quot;&gt;cv@yegor256.com&lt;/a&gt;, and I’ll let you know what I think. I will reply to all emails, but be ready to hear mostly what’s wrong.

writing. Literally, <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=how+to+write+resume">tons of them</a>. And here’s yet another one? Well, maybe … but I don’t think so. I’ll try to give you a few <em>practical</em> hints for how to make your resume look “sexier,” and how to position yourself beyond the “good programmer” category and into the superstar zone. It may take a few years to truly pimp up your CV, but when it’s done, you will charge <a href="/2017/01/24/career-advice.html">$100-plus per hour</a> and face no hesitation from your clients in paying.</p><figure class="jb_picture"><img itemprop="image" alt="Delicatessen (1991) by Jean-Pierre Jeunet" src="/images/2016/03/delicatessen.jpg" longdesc="#8b8ba58d" /><figcaption id="8b8ba58d">Delicatessen (1991) by Jean-Pierre Jeunet</figcaption></figure><h2 id="one-page-no-exceptions">One Page, No Exceptions</h2><p>I think it’s obvious, but only one out of 10 resumes I’ve been getting each day fits onto one page. All the others take three or more pages, and this looks very <em>unprofessional</em>. If you can’t explain yourself in one page, there will be doubts about your skills in scope management, which are very important for a software engineer. It shows you simply can’t filter out what’s non-important and focus on what really matters. Besides, it’s just boring to read three pages.</p><p>Thus, strictly limit yourself to one page, <em>no exceptions</em>. Your resume is an “executive summary” of the product you’re trying to sell. It’s a marketing brochure. A sales flyer. A sticker on my refrigerator, if you wish. It has to be short and straightforward. Employers will either buy it or throw it away. They don’t want to read it; they want to buy you. Or throw your brochure away. Four-page brochures have far fewer chances than one-pagers.</p><h2 id="dont-lie">Don’t Lie</h2><aside class="quote">You can tell half of the truth, you can hide some information, and you can rephrase the truth, but never lie.</aside><p>No matter what you do with your resume, never lie about a single word. You can tell half of the truth, you can hide some information, and you can rephrase the truth, but never lie. You don’t know who is reading your CV and which desk it will end up on. Be ready to answer for every word you have on it.</p><p>If you’re saying that you’re an “expert in JavaScript,” be ready to explain what the key new features of ECMAScript version 6 are. If you can’t, don’t use the word “expert.” The point is that you have to be ready to prove every word.</p><h2 id="sexy-photo-on-the-top">Sexy Photo on the Top</h2><p>You want them to work with you, right? They want to see you. So a photo is a mandatory component of a CV. And try to make it look artistic. Ask your graphic designer friend to style it. Maybe even pay for this work. Just pay attention to the photo; it’s very important.</p><p>Do I have to say that you must smile on that photo? Well, yes, you must. And make it casual, with a T-shirt and funny background. You must look relaxed and successful. You don’t want to get hired; they want to hire you—this is the message your photo should send, just like in online <em>dating</em>.</p><h2 id="skip-objective-and-title">Skip “Objective” and “Title”</h2><p>“Senior Software Developer,” “Seasoned Java Programmer,” “Talented IT Professional,” etc. It’s boring and doesn’t sell you at all. They know what you are, because they are reading your resume.</p><p>Besides that, you’re limiting yourself with that title. Maybe they are looking for a VP of engineering while your resume says “Software Architect.” That’s immediately a mismatch for them. It’s a strike against you. Your <em>name</em> is the title of your resume. That’s it.</p><h2 id="a-dozen-skills">A Dozen Skills</h2><p>This section of your resume actually tells them about your “tech focus.” It must have a very short list of skills, definitely <em>under 12</em>. You simply can’t be an expert in MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and MS SQL at the same time. If there are too many skills, it’s a sign of a “jack of all trades” who is almost always a “master of none.” Don’t do that.</p><aside class="quote">If there are too many skills, it's a sign of a "jack of all trades" who is almost always a "master of none."</aside><p>Find the most important skills in your profile and put them there. Just a few. And make sure the skills are all on the same level of abstraction. Java and AngularJS must not be present together. Java is a few levels higher than AngularJS. Thus, it’s either “Java, SQL, and HTTP” or “AngularJS, Spring Framework, and Web Sockets.” I would recommend you stay at the lowest level you can until you become a serious market figure. For example, “Java” as a skill would look good in <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/22656/jon-skeet">Jon Skeet</a>’s resume, because he definitely knows the entire Java world, and the market has recognized that. But if you’re a programmer with just three years of experience, how can you “know Java?” You barely know a few hundred classes from it. That’s why it’s better to state specifically which parts of Java you definitely know. Like I said, be as low-level and specific in your skills as possible.</p><h2 id="stackoverflow-profile">StackOverflow Profile</h2><p>No matter what anyone <a href="/2014/10/29/how-much-do-you-cost.html">says</a>, <a href="/2017/02/14/stackoverflow-is-your-tool.html">StackOverflow</a> is the de-facto standard platform for asking and answering technical questions. Your presence there and your high rating send a clear message to your potential employer that you’re a superstar (or a rising one). No so many people have 100K or more reputation points there. You must be one of them.</p><p>So even if you don’t have a StackOverflow profile now, create one. Spend one hour on it every day for a few months, answering <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/?tab=interesting">new questions</a>. You will earn 1,000 or more reputation points. Well, provided you have something to say. That’s enough for a start. Post a link to your profile right in your resume.</p><p>Even if you don’t have much to say, be there. Read answers made by others, comment on them, try to help them, and correct them. Become an active part of the community.</p><h2 id="github-profile">GitHub Profile</h2><p>GitHub is the de-facto standard platform for open source code. There are others like BitBucket, but—I hope—they will die sooner or later. As a modern software developer, you must be on GitHub. You <a href="/2015/12/22/why-dont-you-contribute-to-open-source.html">have to contribute</a> to some open source. You have to be visible in the open source world if you want to sell yourself high.</p><aside class="quote">You don't have to spend all your time on open source projects, just contribute to the ones you're using already.</aside><p>Your potential employer wants to see what the <em>market</em> is thinking about your code and about you. They are afraid of making a mistake by hiring you. Your presence in the open source world is a <em>guarantee</em> for them. Someone has already seen your code, and someone has already given some kudos to your projects. Someone virtually vouches for you. As a result, they will feel more comfortable in hiring you.</p><p>To be in the “elite,” you don’t have to spend all your time on open source projects. Just contribute to the ones you’re using already. You’re using Sinatra at work? Check its source code. You will find a lot of places that need improvement. Offer them your help and simply submit small pull requests here and there. Besides that, create your own products and market them. You will be surprised by how many users and followers you will attract in just a few years of such activity.</p><h2 id="certificates">Certificates</h2><p>Some may say they are not important. Maybe so. But your resume must have them. Some of them are not so difficult to get. With just a few weeks of study and a few hundred dollars, you are not just a Java programmer but a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_Certification_Program">certified</a> one. And there are not so many of those out there. There are millions of Java coders in the world, but only a few percent of them are certified. Regardless of whether you think it’s important or not, get those certifications.</p><p>As many as you like. But stay away from <a href="https://www.brainbench.com/">BrainBench</a> and similar sites. Well, you can get certified there, but don’t put them into your resume. That will only demonstrate that you are proud of a very questionable achievement. It’s not a good sign.</p><h2 id="sound-names-and-numbers">Sound Names and Numbers</h2><p>It’s a dangerous trick, so be careful. Here is how it works. You have to go through your entire professional history and find well-known names or big numbers. For example, 10 years ago I was helping a startup create software that had IBM as a subscriber. They managed to get some tracking, and in two months, IBM decided not to use them anymore. It’s a true (and sad) story, but I can put something like this into my resume: “wrote software for IBM.” Am I lying? Not really. If they ask me what exactly I did for IBM, I will explain. In most cases, they won’t ask. They will just buy this big name and put my resume on top of others.</p><p>You can do the same with numbers. Here is another true story. A few years ago, I was helping a company configure a continuous integration pipeline. It was not a big deal, but the company was serving more than 5 million hits per day on its website. That’s a big number. I had nothing to do with this substantial web traffic, but I was in that company for a few months. So I may say in my resume: “configured the delivery pipeline for a 5M-hits-per-day web store.” If they ask me for details, I will be able to give them. I’m not lying.</p><p>Use this technique carefully, and never lie. But do it. Don’t be scared. Your resume needs big names and numbers.</p><h2 id="blog">Blog</h2><p>Create your own blog. Start writing. About what? About your everyday achievements. About the code you write and read. About what you observe in the office. About your thoughts and your plans. About the books you read. You absolutely need to have a blog if you want to position yourself as an expensive software engineer.</p><p>It doesn’t need to be a very popular blog; don’t focus on numbers. But it has to be properly created, designed, and hosted. Don’t use <a href="http://www.wordpress.com">WordPress</a>, <a href="http://www.blogger.com">Blogger</a>, or <a href="http://www.tumblr.com">Tumblr</a>. Instead, I would recommend you think about static site generators like <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> and host it all on <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>. That’s what I’m doing.</p><p>Besides being a valuable addition to your resume, systematic and regular writing will help you structure your thoughts, plans, and decisions. Well, that’s what I’m getting from my blog.</p><h2 id="ambitions">Ambitions</h2><p>If you’re young and your resume is not full of bright achievements yet, you can add “ambitions” section to it. There you say what you’re planning to achieve, to impress your future employer. For example: “learn Go,” “create a new open source CSS framework,” “write a book,” or “earn Oracle Java certification next year.” This will demonstrate that even though you’re young, you do care about your career and professional growth.</p><h2 id="education">Education</h2><p>I would limit yourself to a few letters in this area. Just “MSc” or “BSc” is enough. There’s no need to say when you graduated and from which school. You can give those details later. Well, there are just two exceptions to this rule.</p><p>First, if you’re a PhD, put that on top of your CV. It’s important, and it’s valuable, simply because there are not so many of them among programmers. Second is if your school is Stanford, MIT, or something similar. If that’s the case, also put it on top of your CV.</p><p>In all other situations, just write “BSc” and that’s it.</p><h2 id="conferences">Conferences</h2><p>Every year, you must give a few presentations at <a href="https://www.oracle.com/javaone/index.html">JavaOne</a>. I’m kidding. About the JavaOne part, anyway. But the “every year” part is very true. You must regularly make some speeches somewhere, preferably at JavaOne. But until you get there, speak where you can. Well, where they accept you. Create a profile at <a href="http://lanyrd.com">lanyrd</a> (or something similar) and regularly check which conferences are looking for speakers. Submit there and you will be surprised to see that a few of them will actually accept some of your ideas.</p><p>The easiest subjects to start with are stories about your practical experience with some modern technologies and tools, something like “How Docker Helps Us Optimize Delivery” or “Five Apache Spark Installation Issues.” Just describe what you’ve done on a recent project. It doesn’t really matter what you talk about. What matters is that you’re visible. If the market accepts you, the employer will trust you more. That’s exactly what you need in order to request a higher rate.</p><h2 id="career-history">Career History</h2><p>I’ll be speaking for myself here. As an employer, I don’t really care about your history at all. Moreover, if you have never worked anywhere full-time, I would probably be more interested in working with you. But that’s just me, because I truly believe that modern offices and full-time jobs turn programmers into <a href="/2015/10/06/how-to-be-good-office-slave.html">slaves</a> (and not only programmers).</p><p>Other employers may think differently. Well, they most likely think differently. That’s why you have to demonstrate with which offices you’ve spent 10 recent years of your life. I would recommend you keep this list short. Even if you’ve changed eight companies over the last two years, don’t say that. Just three places is enough. That will show them you’re a good slave—very loyal to previous masters. That’s what they want to see, because they are planning to buy you and become your next master. Right? Sounds harsh? Isn’t <a href="/2015/07/21/hourly-pay-modern-slavery.html">it true</a>?</p><p>Also, your experience section must mention your achievements, not your duties. Instead of “managing 300+ AWS nodes” or “building mobile apps” it’s better to say “created 300+ AWS nodes infrastructure” or “built a few mobile apps.”</p><h2 id="acm-ieee-jug-and-other-memberships">ACM, IEEE, JUG, and Other Memberships</h2><p>These memberships mean literally nothing but will demonstrate that you are part of those communities. Just like with most other things mentioned above, employers will trust you more if the market already trusts you. These memberships don’t really mean that anyone has recognized you, since you get them just by paying annual fees. But still, you’re paying those fees, and most other applicants aren’t. You’re definitely more reliable than many others.</p><h2 id="mention-hobbies">Mention Hobbies</h2><p>I think information about hobbies is important. Some say it’s not, but I believe that a personal “click” between you and your potential employer plays an important role. There is a human on that side. He or she is reading your CV, and he or she wants to like you—mostly in order to be comfortable making a hiring decision. Help him or her like you faster. Mention that you enjoy skiing, monkey-feeding in the zoo, and Jimmy Kimmel. Be creative, not boring. Just like you do in online dating.</p><h2 id="layoutgraphics">Layout/Graphics</h2><p>How should your one page look? Stand out! It must express your personality. Don’t use the “resume templates” downloadable for free. Create your own layout and design. If you’re not a designer, ask your Photoshop friend to do it for you. Actually, there is not much to do; just select the right font and add a few colors here and there.</p><p>This CV is your product. You made it. It’s your baby. If it’s just a Word document in a standard template, they will feel you didn’t pay attention to it. You didn’t even care to create that small but very important product nicely. How will you create their software? With the same attitude. Don’t ruin the whole show with a careless design. That’s the key word here—“careless.” It doesn’t need to be complex. It may be very simple. But it must be <em>yours</em>, made with care and love.</p><hr /><p>Want free advice on your resume?

You will be surprised by how many users and followers you will attract in just a few years of such activity.</p><h2 id="certificates">Certificates</h2><p>Some may say they are not important. Maybe so. But your resume must have them. Some of them are not so difficult to get. With just a few weeks of study and a few hundred dollars, you are not just a Java programmer but a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_Certification_Program">certified</a> one. And there are not so many of those out there. There are millions of Java coders in the world, but only a few percent of them are certified. Regardless of whether you think it’s important or not, get those certifications.</p><p>As many as you like. But stay away from <a href="https://www.brainbench.com/">BrainBench</a> and similar sites. Well, you can get certified there, but don’t put them into your resume. That will only demonstrate that you are proud of a very questionable achievement. It’s not a good sign.</p><h2 id="sound-names-and-numbers">Sound Names and Numbers</h2><p>It’s a dangerous trick, so be careful. Here is how it works. You have to go through your entire professional history and find well-known names or big numbers. For example, 10 years ago I was helping a startup create software that had IBM as a subscriber. They managed to get some tracking, and in two months, IBM decided not to use them anymore. It’s a true (and sad) story, but I can put something like this into my resume: “wrote software for IBM.” Am I lying? Not really. If they ask me what exactly I did for IBM, I will explain. In most cases, they won’t ask. They will just buy this big name and put my resume on top of others.</p><p>You can do the same with numbers. Here is another true story. A few years ago, I was helping a company configure a continuous integration pipeline. It was not a big deal, but the company was serving more than 5 million hits per day on its website. That’s a big number. I had nothing to do with this substantial web traffic, but I was in that company for a few months. So I may say in my resume: “configured the delivery pipeline for a 5M-hits-per-day web store.” If they ask me for details, I will be able to give them. I’m not lying.</p><p>Use this technique carefully, and never lie. But do it. Don’t be scared. Your resume needs big names and numbers.</p><h2 id="blog">Blog</h2><p>Create your own blog. Start writing. About what? About your everyday achievements. About the code you write and read. About what you observe in the office. About your thoughts and your plans. About the books you read. You absolutely need to have a blog if you want to position yourself as an expensive software engineer.</p><p>It doesn’t need to be a very popular blog; don’t focus on numbers. But it has to be properly created, designed, and hosted. Don’t use <a href="http://www.wordpress.com">WordPress</a>, <a href="http://www.blogger.com">Blogger</a>, or <a href="http://www.tumblr.com">Tumblr</a>. Instead, I would recommend you think about static site generators like <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> and host it all on <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>. That’s what I’m doing.</p><p>Besides being a valuable addition to your resume, systematic and regular writing will help you structure your thoughts, plans, and decisions. Well, that’s what I’m getting from my blog.</p><h2 id="ambitions">Ambitions</h2><p>If you’re young and your resume is not full of bright achievements yet, you can add “ambitions” section to it. There you say what you’re planning to achieve, to impress your future employer. For example: “learn Go,” “create a new open source CSS framework,” “write a book,” or “earn Oracle Java certification next year.” This will demonstrate that even though you’re young, you do care about your career and professional growth.</p><h2 id="education">Education</h2><p>I would limit yourself to a few letters in this area. Just “MSc” or “BSc” is enough. There’s no need to say when you graduated and from which school. You can give those details later. Well, there are just two exceptions to this rule.</p><p>First, if you’re a PhD, put that on top of your CV. It’s important, and it’s valuable, simply because there are not so many of them among programmers. Second is if your school is Stanford, MIT, or something similar. If that’s the case, also put it on top of your CV.</p><p>In all other situations, just write “BSc” and that’s it.</p><h2 id="conferences">Conferences</h2><p>Every year, you must give a few presentations at <a href="https://www.oracle.com/javaone/index.html">JavaOne</a>. I’m kidding. About the JavaOne part, anyway. But the “every year” part is very true. You must regularly make some speeches somewhere, preferably at JavaOne. But until you get there, speak where you can. Well, where they accept you. Create a profile at <a href="http://lanyrd.com">lanyrd</a> (or something similar) and regularly check which conferences are looking for speakers. Submit there and you will be surprised to see that a few of them will actually accept some of your ideas.</p><p>The easiest subjects to start with are stories about your practical experience with some modern technologies and tools, something like “How Docker Helps Us Optimize Delivery” or “Five Apache Spark Installation Issues.” Just describe what you’ve done on a recent project. It doesn’t really matter what you talk about. What matters is that you’re visible. If the market accepts you, the employer will trust you more. That’s exactly what you need in order to request a higher rate.</p><h2 id="career-history">Career History</h2><p>I’ll be speaking for myself here. As an employer, I don’t really care about your history at all. Moreover, if you have never worked anywhere full-time, I would probably be more interested in working with you. But that’s just me, because I truly believe that modern offices and full-time jobs turn programmers into <a href="/2015/10/06/how-to-be-good-office-slave.html">slaves</a> (and not only programmers).</p><p>Other employers may think differently. Well, they most likely think differently. That’s why you have to demonstrate with which offices you’ve spent 10 recent years of your life. I would recommend you keep this list short. Even if you’ve changed eight companies over the last two years, don’t say that. Just three places is enough. That will show them you’re a good slave—very loyal to previous masters. That’s what they want to see, because they are planning to buy you and become your next master. Right? Sounds harsh? Isn’t <a href="/2015/07/21/hourly-pay-modern-slavery.html">it true</a>?</p><p>Also, your experience section must mention your achievements, not your duties. Instead of “managing 300+ AWS nodes” or “building mobile apps” it’s better to say “created 300+ AWS nodes infrastructure” or “built a few mobile apps.”</p><h2 id="acm-ieee-jug-and-other-memberships">ACM, IEEE, JUG, and Other Memberships</h2><p>These memberships mean literally nothing but will demonstrate that you are part of those communities. Just like with most other things mentioned above, employers will trust you more if the market already trusts you. These memberships don’t really mean that anyone has recognized you, since you get them just by paying annual fees. But still, you’re paying those fees, and most other applicants aren’t. You’re definitely more reliable than many others.</p><h2 id="mention-hobbies">Mention Hobbies</h2><p>I think information about hobbies is important. Some say it’s not, but I believe that a personal “click” between you and your potential employer plays an important role. There is a human on that side. He or she is reading your CV, and he or she wants to like you—mostly in order to be comfortable making a hiring decision. Help him or her like you faster. Mention that you enjoy skiing, monkey-feeding in the zoo, and Jimmy Kimmel. Be creative, not boring. Just like you do in online dating.</p><h2 id="layoutgraphics">Layout/Graphics</h2><p>How should your one page look? Stand out! It must express your personality. Don’t use the “resume templates” downloadable for free. Create your own layout and design. If you’re not a designer, ask your Photoshop friend to do it for you. Actually, there is not much to do; just select the right font and add a few colors here and there.</p><p>This CV is your product. You made it. It’s your baby. If it’s just a Word document in a standard template, they will feel you didn’t pay attention to it. You didn’t even care to create that small but very important product nicely. How will you create their software? With the same attitude. Don’t ruin the whole show with a careless design. That’s the key word here—“careless.” It doesn’t need to be complex. It may be very simple. But it must be <em>yours</em>, made with care and love.</p><hr /><p>Want free advice on your resume?

The first question I usually ask is “what is your rate?” (we pay &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/04/17/how-xdsd-is-different.html&quot;&gt;by the hour&lt;/a&gt;) What surprises me is how often people incorrectly estimate themselves, in both directions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I hear very different numbers, from $5 to $500 per hour. I never say no, but usually come up with my own hourly rate estimate. This article explains what factors I do and don’t take into account. These are my personal criteria; don’t take them as an industry standard. I do find them objective and logical, though—so let me explain.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;!--more--&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;open-source-contribution&quot;&gt;Open Source Contribution&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;badge&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.yegor256.com/images/2014/11/rate-open-source-contribution.png&quot; style=&quot;width:350px;max-width:100%;&quot; alt=&quot;badge&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is the first and the most important characteristic of a software developer. Do you contribute to open source projects? Do you have your own &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/12/22/why-dont-you-contribute-to-open-source.html&quot;&gt;open source&lt;/a&gt; libraries that are used by some community? Do you write code that is publicly available and used?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you have nothing to show here, I see three possible causes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;youtube&quot;&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GS45LzE3LPQ&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;box&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GS45LzE3LPQ/mqdefault.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;YouTube video #GS45LzE3LPQ&quot; /&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;play&quot;&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;icon icon-play&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;div&gt;How Much Do You Cost?; 27 May 2017.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;First, you’re &lt;strong&gt;too shy to share&lt;/strong&gt; your code because &lt;strong&gt;it’s crap&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/12/22/why-dont-you-contribute-to-open-source.html&quot;&gt;Obviously&lt;/a&gt;, this is not a good sign. Not because your code could be bad, but because you’re not brave enough to face this fact and improve. In our teams we &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/08/13/strict-code-quality-control.html&quot;&gt;pay a lot of attention&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=&quot;/2017/04/11/flexibility-equates-lower-quality.html&quot;&gt;quality&lt;/a&gt; of code and most of our new team members get surprised by just how high our quality bar is. You will also be surprised. The question is whether you will be able to adapt and improve or if you will give up and quit. If you didn’t share your code before and have never dealt with negative feedback, you won’t feel comfortable in our projects, where quality requirements are very high.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;You're not able to at least find and fix one bug in some open source product you're using?&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;The second possible cause is that you work from nine till five, for food, &lt;strong&gt;without passion&lt;/strong&gt;. Actually, nobody manifests it that way. Instead, I often hear something like “my company doesn’t pay me for open source contribution and at home I want to spend time with my family.” In modern software development, most of the code we’re working with is open source—libraries, frameworks, tools, instruments, etc. Almost everything you’re using in your commercial projects is open source. By paying your salary your employer does already invest in open source products, because you’re an active user of them. The problem is that &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; are not interested in becoming more active in that contribution. I see this as a lack of passion and self-motivation. Will you be an effective developer in our projects? Not at all, because our entire management model relies on &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/04/17/how-xdsd-is-different.html&quot;&gt;self-motivation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;youtube&quot;&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mfo_FHL3PE&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;box&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6mfo_FHL3PE/mqdefault.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;YouTube video #6mfo_FHL3PE&quot; /&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;play&quot;&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;icon icon-play&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;div&gt;How we decide how much to pay programmers?; 18 December 2017.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;The last possible cause is that you don’t know what to write and where to contribute, which means &lt;strong&gt;lack of creativity&lt;/strong&gt;. As I mentioned above, almost everything we’re using now is open source, and these tools are full of bugs and not-yet-implemented features. At the same time, you don’t see any areas for improvement? You don’t know what can be done better? You’re not able to at least find, report and fix one bug in some open source product you’re using every day? This means that you won’t be able to find areas of improvement in our projects either, while we rely on your ability to &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/04/13/bugs-are-welcome.html&quot;&gt;discover problems creatively&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thus, if your GitHub account is empty and your CV doesn’t position you as “an active contributor to Linux kernel” (yeah, why not?), I immediately lose interest. On the other hand, when I see a 100+ stars project in your GitHub account, I get excited and ready to offer a higher rate.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;geographic-location&quot;&gt;Geographic Location&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is a common practice to pay higher rates to those who live in more expensive countries. When I’m getting resumes from San Francisco programmers, their rates are $70+ per hour. The same skills and experience cost $15-20 in Karachi. The reason here is the cost of living—it is much higher in the US than in Pakistan.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;We prefer to work with people whose expenses are lower&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, this reason doesn’t sound logical to me. If you’re driving a more expensive car, we have to pay you a &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/12/06/how-to-pay-programmers-less.html&quot;&gt;higher salary&lt;/a&gt;? The same with the place to stay. You’ve chosen the country that you live in. You’re using all the benefits of a well-developed country and you’re paying for them. It’s your choice. You decided to spend more money for the quality of your life—what does it have to do with me?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Want to pay $30 for a lunch? Become a better engineer. Until then, buy a hot dog for a few bucks. Just saying that “I’m already here and my lunch costs $30” is not an argument.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thus, the more expensive the place you live, the less money stays in your pocket. For us this means that $100 will motivate a programmer from Karachi much stronger than the same $100 will motivate the same person, if she lives in San Francisco. Thus, we prefer to work with people whose expenses are lower. Our money will simply work better.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;stackoverflowcom-reputation&quot;&gt;StackOverflow.com Reputation&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;We all know what StackOverflow has but very few people (surprisingly few!) actively contributing to it. If your profile there is empty (or you don’t have one) I realize that you 1) don’t have any questions to ask and 2) you have nothing to answer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;First, if you’re not asking anything there, you are not growing. Your education process stopped some time ago, probably right after you got an &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/10/06/how-to-be-good-office-slave.html&quot;&gt;office job&lt;/a&gt;. Or maybe you’re too shy to ask? Or you can’t describe your questions in an accurate and precise format? Or maybe all your questions already have answers? In any case, it’s sad.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;SO reputation is proof that you can find answers to your questions by communicating with people you don't know&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;Second, if you’re not answering, you simply have nothing to say. In most cases, this means that you’re not solving complex and unique problems. You’re simply wiring together well-known components and collecting your paychecks.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Very often I hear people saying that they solve most of their problems by asking their colleagues sitting next to them in the &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/10/06/how-to-be-good-office-slave.html&quot;&gt;office&lt;/a&gt;. They say they simply don’t need StackOverflow (or similar resources, if they exist) because their team is so great that any questions can be answered internally. That’s good for the team and bad for you. Why? You don’t have a very important skill—finding an answer in a public Internet. In our projects we &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/10/07/stop-chatting-start-coding.html&quot;&gt;discourage&lt;/a&gt; any horizontal &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/08/23/communication-maturity.html&quot;&gt;communications&lt;/a&gt; between programmers, and you won’t be able to get any help from anyone. You will be on your own and you will fail, because you are used to be patronized by someone senior, in your &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/10/06/how-to-be-good-office-slave.html&quot;&gt;office&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;How much would you charge per hour, for a remote part-time consulting gig? &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/freelance?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#freelance&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;--- Yegor Bugayenko (@yegor256) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/yegor256/status/993162626497699840?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;May 6, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/2017/02/14/stackoverflow-is-your-tool.html&quot;&gt;StackOverflow&lt;/a&gt; is not just an indicator of how smart you are and how many upvotes you got for the “&lt;a href=&quot;http://stackoverflow.com/questions/234075/what-is-your-best-programmer-joke&quot;&gt;best programming joke&lt;/a&gt;.” It is proof that you can find answers to your questions by communicating with people you don’t know. It is a very important skill.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;years-of-experience&quot;&gt;Years of Experience&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;badge&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.yegor256.com/images/2014/11/rate-years-of-experience.png&quot; style=&quot;width:350px;max-width:100%;&quot; alt=&quot;badge&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I’ve written Java for 10 years!”—so what? This number means only one thing to me—you managed to survive in some office for ten years. Or maybe in a few offices. You managed to convince someone that he has to pay you for ten years of sitting in his building. Does it mean that you were writing something useful? Does it mean that your code was perfect? It doesn’t mean any of that.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Years of experience is a false indicator. It actually may play against you, in combination with other indicators mentioned above. If your CV says that you just started to program two years ago and your GitHub and StackOverflow accounts are empty—there is still a chance you will improve. You’re just in the beginning of your career. However, if your CV says that you’re a “10-year seasoned architect” with zero open source contribution—this means that you’re either lying about that ten years or you’re &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/09/29/mayonnaise.html&quot;&gt;absolutely useless&lt;/a&gt; as an architect.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;My point is that the “years of experience” argument should be used very carefully. Play this card only if you have other merits. Otherwise, keep it to yourself.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;certifications&quot;&gt;Certifications&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;badge&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.yegor256.com/images/2014/11/rate-certifications.png&quot; style=&quot;width:350px;max-width:100%;&quot; alt=&quot;badge&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Oracle, Zend, Amazon, IBM, MySQL, etc.—I’m talking about these certifications. In order to get them you should pass an exam. Not an easy one and not online. It is a real exam taken in a certification center, where you’re sitting in front of a computer for a few hours, without any books or Internet access, answering questions. Rather humiliating activity for a respected software developer? Indeed. And there is a high probability of failure, which is also rather embarrassing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is a very good sign, if you managed to go through this. If you’ve done it a few times, even better. However, if you’ve earned no certifications in your entire &lt;a href=&quot;/2017/01/24/career-advice.html&quot;&gt;career&lt;/a&gt;, it is for one of the following reasons:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;First, you’re &lt;strong&gt;afraid to lose&lt;/strong&gt;. A serious certification may cost a few hundred dollars (I paid over $700 for &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_Certification_Program&quot;&gt;SCEA&lt;/a&gt;) and you will not get a refund if you fail. If you’re afraid to lose, you’re afraid to fight. This means you’ll chicken out in a real-life situation, where a complex problem will need to be solved.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Second, you &lt;strong&gt;don’t invest&lt;/strong&gt; in your profile. This most probably means that you don’t want to change companies and prefer to find a peaceful office, where you can stay forever. I remember I once said to a friend of mine—“you will greatly improve your CV if you pass this certification.” He answered with a smile—“I hope I won’t need a CV any more, I like this company.” This attitude is &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/10/06/how-to-be-good-office-slave.html&quot;&gt;very beneficial&lt;/a&gt; for the company you’re working for, but it definitely works &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/07/21/hourly-pay-modern-slavery.html&quot;&gt;against&lt;/a&gt; you.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In my experience, the best &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/03/02/team-morale-myths-and-reality.html&quot;&gt;team players&lt;/a&gt; are those who work for themselves. Healthy &lt;strong&gt;individualism&lt;/strong&gt; is a key success factor. If your primary objective is to earn for yourself (money, reputation, skills, or knowledge)—you will be very effective in our projects. Certifications in your profile is an indicator of that healthy individualism we’re looking for.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;skills-variety&quot;&gt;Skills Variety&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The more technologies or programming languages you know, the less you cost. I’m not saying that it’s not possible to be an expert in many things at the same time—that’s entirely possible. But let me give you a pragmatic reason why you shouldn’t—competition. There are thousands of “Java7 programmers” on the market—we can easily choose whoever we need. But there are not so many “Hadoop programmers” or “XSLT designers.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;We end up paying more to narrow-skilled specialists because we have no choice&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you focus on some specific area and become an expert there, your chances of finding a job are lower, but the payout will be bigger. We usually end up paying more to narrow-skilled specialists, mostly because we have no choice. If a project we’re working on needs a Lucene expert, we’ll find the right person and do our best to get him/her on board. Doing our best means increasing the price, in most cases.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thus, when I hear that you’re “experienced in MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle and SQLite” I realize that you know very little about databases.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;talks-and-publications&quot;&gt;Talks and Publications&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;badge&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.yegor256.com/images/2014/11/rate-talks-and-publications.png&quot; style=&quot;width:350px;max-width:100%;&quot; alt=&quot;badge&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;I think it is obvious that having a blog (about programming, not about your favorite cat) is a positive factor. Even better is to be an occasional &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/05/10/keynote-clowns.html&quot;&gt;speaker&lt;/a&gt; at conferences or meetups. When it is a blog, I pay attention to the amount of comments people leave for your articles. If it is a conference, the most important criteria is how difficult it was to get to the list of speakers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Both blog articles and conference presentations make you much more valuable as a specialist. Mostly because these things demonstrate that some people &lt;strong&gt;already reviewed&lt;/strong&gt; your work and your talent. And it was not just a single employer, but a group of other programmers and engineers. This means that we also can rely on your opinions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Besides that, if you write and present regularly, you have a very important skill/talent—you can present your ideas in a “digestible” way. In our projects we &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/10/07/stop-chatting-start-coding.html&quot;&gt;discourage informal communications&lt;/a&gt; and use ticketing systems instead. In those tickets you will have to explain your ideas, questions or concerns so that everybody can understand you. Without enough presentation skills, you won’t survive in your projects.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;BTW, some software developers even file patents in their names—why can’t you do this? Or maybe even publish a book. Why not?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;previous-employment&quot;&gt;Previous Employment&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;I usually don’t pay much attention to this section of your CV. Our management model is &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/04/17/how-xdsd-is-different.html&quot;&gt;so different&lt;/a&gt; from anything you can see anywhere else that it doesn’t really matter how many times you were fired before and how senior of a position you have/had with your full-time employer. Even if your title is “CTO of Twitter”—it doesn’t mean anything to me.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;My experience tells me that the bigger the company and the higher the position in it—the further away you stay from the source code and from real technical decisions. VPs and CTOs spend most of their time on management meetings and internal &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/09/27/command-control-innovate.html&quot;&gt;politics&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I’m much more interested in &lt;strong&gt;what&lt;/strong&gt; you’ve done over the last few years than in &lt;strong&gt;where&lt;/strong&gt; you’ve done it and what they called you while you were doing it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;education&quot;&gt;Education&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;BSc, MSc, PhD… do we care? Not really. Education is very similar to the “previous employment” mentioned above. It doesn’t really matter where exactly you’ve spent those five years after school. What matters is what have you done during that time. If you have nothing to say about your activity in the university than what will the name of it tell me?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Well, of course, if it is Stanford or MIT, this will make a difference. In this case I can see that you managed to pass their graduation standards and managed to find money to study there. This is a good sign and will definitely increase your hourly rate. But if it is some mambo-jambo university from nowhere (like the one I graduated from), keep this information to yourself.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;rates&quot;&gt;Rates&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;$100+&lt;/strong&gt; per hour we gladly pay to an expert who owns a few popular open source products; has a StackOverflow score above 20K; has certifications, articles, presentations, and maybe even patents.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;$50+&lt;/strong&gt; per hour we pay to a professional programmer who has open source projects on his own or is an active contributor; has a StackOverflow score over 5K; is writing about software development; possesses a few certifications.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;$30+&lt;/strong&gt; per hour we pay to a programmer who regularly contributes to open source code; is present in StackOverflow; has some certifications.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;$15&lt;/strong&gt; per hour we pay to everybody else.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Don’t get me wrong and don’t take these numbers personally. The rate you’re getting is a measurable metric of your professional level, not of you as a person. Besides, the level is not static, it is changing every day, and it’s entirely in your hands.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I wrote this article mostly in order to motivate you to grow.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;All these criteria are applicable to new members of our teams. Once you start writing some code, we measure your performance and you may get completely different numbers, see &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/04/20/how-hourly-rate-is-calculated.html&quot;&gt;How Hourly Rate Is Calculated&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;BTW, illustrations you see above are created by &lt;a href=&quot;http://andreeamironiuc.com/&quot;&gt;Andreea Mironiuc&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; " /> <meta name="keywords" content="next, path, output, content, previous, url, relative_path, id, collection, excerpt, draft, categories, layout, title, date, tags, description, keywords, translated, related, image, slug, ext" /> <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1"/> <meta name="google-site-verification" content="JEj_gQr2CPe2QKGw8XdMz0R7VboQIUbX3FlM-lwTq-8" /> <meta name="author" content="Yegor Bugayenko"> <meta name="article:published_time" content="2014-10-29 00:00:00 +0000"> <meta name="og:site_name" content="Yegor Bugayenko"/> <meta name="og:type" content="article" /> <meta name="og:locale" content="en_US" /> <meta name="twitter:account_id" content="4503599630178231" /> <meta name="twitter:creator" content="@yegor256"/> <meta name="twitter:site" content="@yegor256"/> <meta name="twitter:title" property="og:title" content="How Much Do You Cost?"/> <meta name="twitter:description" property="og:description" content="&lt;figure class=&quot;badge&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zerocracy.com&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;//www.0crat.com/svg/logo.svg&quot; style=&quot;width:100px;max-width:100%;&quot; alt=&quot;badge&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;I’m getting a few emails every day from programmers interested in working with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zerocracy.com&quot;&gt;Zerocracy&lt;/a&gt; remotely. The first question I usually ask is “what is your rate?” (we pay &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/04/17/how-xdsd-is-different.html&quot;&gt;by the hour&lt;/a&gt;) What surprises me is how often people incorrectly estimate themselves, in both directions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I hear very different numbers, from $5 to $500 per hour. I never say no, but usually come up with my own hourly rate estimate. This article explains what factors I do and don’t take into account. These are my personal criteria; don’t take them as an industry standard. I do find them objective and logical, though—so let me explain.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;!--more--&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;open-source-contribution&quot;&gt;Open Source Contribution&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;badge&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.yegor256.com/images/2014/11/rate-open-source-contribution.png&quot; style=&quot;width:350px;max-width:100%;&quot; alt=&quot;badge&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is the first and the most important characteristic of a software developer. Do you contribute to open source projects? Do you have your own &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/12/22/why-dont-you-contribute-to-open-source.html&quot;&gt;open source&lt;/a&gt; libraries that are used by some community? Do you write code that is publicly available and used?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you have nothing to show here, I see three possible causes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;youtube&quot;&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GS45LzE3LPQ&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;box&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GS45LzE3LPQ/mqdefault.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;YouTube video #GS45LzE3LPQ&quot; /&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;play&quot;&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;icon icon-play&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;div&gt;How Much Do You Cost?; 27 May 2017.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;First, you’re &lt;strong&gt;too shy to share&lt;/strong&gt; your code because &lt;strong&gt;it’s crap&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/12/22/why-dont-you-contribute-to-open-source.html&quot;&gt;Obviously&lt;/a&gt;, this is not a good sign. Not because your code could be bad, but because you’re not brave enough to face this fact and improve. In our teams we &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/08/13/strict-code-quality-control.html&quot;&gt;pay a lot of attention&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=&quot;/2017/04/11/flexibility-equates-lower-quality.html&quot;&gt;quality&lt;/a&gt; of code and most of our new team members get surprised by just how high our quality bar is. You will also be surprised. The question is whether you will be able to adapt and improve or if you will give up and quit. If you didn’t share your code before and have never dealt with negative feedback, you won’t feel comfortable in our projects, where quality requirements are very high.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;You're not able to at least find and fix one bug in some open source product you're using?&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;The second possible cause is that you work from nine till five, for food, &lt;strong&gt;without passion&lt;/strong&gt;. Actually, nobody manifests it that way. Instead, I often hear something like “my company doesn’t pay me for open source contribution and at home I want to spend time with my family.” In modern software development, most of the code we’re working with is open source—libraries, frameworks, tools, instruments, etc. Almost everything you’re using in your commercial projects is open source. By paying your salary your employer does already invest in open source products, because you’re an active user of them. The problem is that &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; are not interested in becoming more active in that contribution. I see this as a lack of passion and self-motivation. Will you be an effective developer in our projects? Not at all, because our entire management model relies on &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/04/17/how-xdsd-is-different.html&quot;&gt;self-motivation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;youtube&quot;&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mfo_FHL3PE&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;box&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6mfo_FHL3PE/mqdefault.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;YouTube video #6mfo_FHL3PE&quot; /&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;play&quot;&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;icon icon-play&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;div&gt;How we decide how much to pay programmers?; 18 December 2017.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;The last possible cause is that you don’t know what to write and where to contribute, which means &lt;strong&gt;lack of creativity&lt;/strong&gt;. As I mentioned above, almost everything we’re using now is open source, and these tools are full of bugs and not-yet-implemented features. At the same time, you don’t see any areas for improvement? You don’t know what can be done better? You’re not able to at least find, report and fix one bug in some open source product you’re using every day? This means that you won’t be able to find areas of improvement in our projects either, while we rely on your ability to &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/04/13/bugs-are-welcome.html&quot;&gt;discover problems creatively&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thus, if your GitHub account is empty and your CV doesn’t position you as “an active contributor to Linux kernel” (yeah, why not?), I immediately lose interest. On the other hand, when I see a 100+ stars project in your GitHub account, I get excited and ready to offer a higher rate.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;geographic-location&quot;&gt;Geographic Location&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is a common practice to pay higher rates to those who live in more expensive countries. When I’m getting resumes from San Francisco programmers, their rates are $70+ per hour. The same skills and experience cost $15-20 in Karachi. The reason here is the cost of living—it is much higher in the US than in Pakistan.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;We prefer to work with people whose expenses are lower&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, this reason doesn’t sound logical to me. If you’re driving a more expensive car, we have to pay you a &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/12/06/how-to-pay-programmers-less.html&quot;&gt;higher salary&lt;/a&gt;? The same with the place to stay. You’ve chosen the country that you live in. You’re using all the benefits of a well-developed country and you’re paying for them. It’s your choice. You decided to spend more money for the quality of your life—what does it have to do with me?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Want to pay $30 for a lunch? Become a better engineer. Until then, buy a hot dog for a few bucks. Just saying that “I’m already here and my lunch costs $30” is not an argument.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thus, the more expensive the place you live, the less money stays in your pocket. For us this means that $100 will motivate a programmer from Karachi much stronger than the same $100 will motivate the same person, if she lives in San Francisco. Thus, we prefer to work with people whose expenses are lower. Our money will simply work better.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;stackoverflowcom-reputation&quot;&gt;StackOverflow.com Reputation&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;We all know what StackOverflow has but very few people (surprisingly few!) actively contributing to it. If your profile there is empty (or you don’t have one) I realize that you 1) don’t have any questions to ask and 2) you have nothing to answer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;First, if you’re not asking anything there, you are not growing. Your education process stopped some time ago, probably right after you got an &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/10/06/how-to-be-good-office-slave.html&quot;&gt;office job&lt;/a&gt;. Or maybe you’re too shy to ask? Or you can’t describe your questions in an accurate and precise format? Or maybe all your questions already have answers? In any case, it’s sad.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;SO reputation is proof that you can find answers to your questions by communicating with people you don't know&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;Second, if you’re not answering, you simply have nothing to say. In most cases, this means that you’re not solving complex and unique problems. You’re simply wiring together well-known components and collecting your paychecks.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Very often I hear people saying that they solve most of their problems by asking their colleagues sitting next to them in the &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/10/06/how-to-be-good-office-slave.html&quot;&gt;office&lt;/a&gt;. They say they simply don’t need StackOverflow (or similar resources, if they exist) because their team is so great that any questions can be answered internally. That’s good for the team and bad for you. Why? You don’t have a very important skill—finding an answer in a public Internet. In our projects we &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/10/07/stop-chatting-start-coding.html&quot;&gt;discourage&lt;/a&gt; any horizontal &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/08/23/communication-maturity.html&quot;&gt;communications&lt;/a&gt; between programmers, and you won’t be able to get any help from anyone. You will be on your own and you will fail, because you are used to be patronized by someone senior, in your &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/10/06/how-to-be-good-office-slave.html&quot;&gt;office&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;How much would you charge per hour, for a remote part-time consulting gig? &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/freelance?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#freelance&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;--- Yegor Bugayenko (@yegor256) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/yegor256/status/993162626497699840?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;May 6, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/2017/02/14/stackoverflow-is-your-tool.html&quot;&gt;StackOverflow&lt;/a&gt; is not just an indicator of how smart you are and how many upvotes you got for the “&lt;a href=&quot;http://stackoverflow.com/questions/234075/what-is-your-best-programmer-joke&quot;&gt;best programming joke&lt;/a&gt;.” It is proof that you can find answers to your questions by communicating with people you don’t know. It is a very important skill.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;years-of-experience&quot;&gt;Years of Experience&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;badge&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.yegor256.com/images/2014/11/rate-years-of-experience.png&quot; style=&quot;width:350px;max-width:100%;&quot; alt=&quot;badge&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I’ve written Java for 10 years!”—so what? This number means only one thing to me—you managed to survive in some office for ten years. Or maybe in a few offices. You managed to convince someone that he has to pay you for ten years of sitting in his building. Does it mean that you were writing something useful? Does it mean that your code was perfect? It doesn’t mean any of that.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Years of experience is a false indicator. It actually may play against you, in combination with other indicators mentioned above. If your CV says that you just started to program two years ago and your GitHub and StackOverflow accounts are empty—there is still a chance you will improve. You’re just in the beginning of your career. However, if your CV says that you’re a “10-year seasoned architect” with zero open source contribution—this means that you’re either lying about that ten years or you’re &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/09/29/mayonnaise.html&quot;&gt;absolutely useless&lt;/a&gt; as an architect.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;My point is that the “years of experience” argument should be used very carefully. Play this card only if you have other merits. Otherwise, keep it to yourself.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;certifications&quot;&gt;Certifications&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;badge&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.yegor256.com/images/2014/11/rate-certifications.png&quot; style=&quot;width:350px;max-width:100%;&quot; alt=&quot;badge&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Oracle, Zend, Amazon, IBM, MySQL, etc.—I’m talking about these certifications. In order to get them you should pass an exam. Not an easy one and not online. It is a real exam taken in a certification center, where you’re sitting in front of a computer for a few hours, without any books or Internet access, answering questions. Rather humiliating activity for a respected software developer? Indeed. And there is a high probability of failure, which is also rather embarrassing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is a very good sign, if you managed to go through this. If you’ve done it a few times, even better. However, if you’ve earned no certifications in your entire &lt;a href=&quot;/2017/01/24/career-advice.html&quot;&gt;career&lt;/a&gt;, it is for one of the following reasons:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;First, you’re &lt;strong&gt;afraid to lose&lt;/strong&gt;. A serious certification may cost a few hundred dollars (I paid over $700 for &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_Certification_Program&quot;&gt;SCEA&lt;/a&gt;) and you will not get a refund if you fail. If you’re afraid to lose, you’re afraid to fight. This means you’ll chicken out in a real-life situation, where a complex problem will need to be solved.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Second, you &lt;strong&gt;don’t invest&lt;/strong&gt; in your profile. This most probably means that you don’t want to change companies and prefer to find a peaceful office, where you can stay forever. I remember I once said to a friend of mine—“you will greatly improve your CV if you pass this certification.” He answered with a smile—“I hope I won’t need a CV any more, I like this company.” This attitude is &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/10/06/how-to-be-good-office-slave.html&quot;&gt;very beneficial&lt;/a&gt; for the company you’re working for, but it definitely works &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/07/21/hourly-pay-modern-slavery.html&quot;&gt;against&lt;/a&gt; you.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In my experience, the best &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/03/02/team-morale-myths-and-reality.html&quot;&gt;team players&lt;/a&gt; are those who work for themselves. Healthy &lt;strong&gt;individualism&lt;/strong&gt; is a key success factor. If your primary objective is to earn for yourself (money, reputation, skills, or knowledge)—you will be very effective in our projects. Certifications in your profile is an indicator of that healthy individualism we’re looking for.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;skills-variety&quot;&gt;Skills Variety&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The more technologies or programming languages you know, the less you cost. I’m not saying that it’s not possible to be an expert in many things at the same time—that’s entirely possible. But let me give you a pragmatic reason why you shouldn’t—competition. There are thousands of “Java7 programmers” on the market—we can easily choose whoever we need. But there are not so many “Hadoop programmers” or “XSLT designers.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;We end up paying more to narrow-skilled specialists because we have no choice&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you focus on some specific area and become an expert there, your chances of finding a job are lower, but the payout will be bigger. We usually end up paying more to narrow-skilled specialists, mostly because we have no choice. If a project we’re working on needs a Lucene expert, we’ll find the right person and do our best to get him/her on board. Doing our best means increasing the price, in most cases.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thus, when I hear that you’re “experienced in MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle and SQLite” I realize that you know very little about databases.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;talks-and-publications&quot;&gt;Talks and Publications&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;badge&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.yegor256.com/images/2014/11/rate-talks-and-publications.png&quot; style=&quot;width:350px;max-width:100%;&quot; alt=&quot;badge&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;I think it is obvious that having a blog (about programming, not about your favorite cat) is a positive factor. Even better is to be an occasional &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/05/10/keynote-clowns.html&quot;&gt;speaker&lt;/a&gt; at conferences or meetups. When it is a blog, I pay attention to the amount of comments people leave for your articles. If it is a conference, the most important criteria is how difficult it was to get to the list of speakers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Both blog articles and conference presentations make you much more valuable as a specialist. Mostly because these things demonstrate that some people &lt;strong&gt;already reviewed&lt;/strong&gt; your work and your talent. And it was not just a single employer, but a group of other programmers and engineers. This means that we also can rely on your opinions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Besides that, if you write and present regularly, you have a very important skill/talent—you can present your ideas in a “digestible” way. In our projects we &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/10/07/stop-chatting-start-coding.html&quot;&gt;discourage informal communications&lt;/a&gt; and use ticketing systems instead. In those tickets you will have to explain your ideas, questions or concerns so that everybody can understand you. Without enough presentation skills, you won’t survive in your projects.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;BTW, some software developers even file patents in their names—why can’t you do this? Or maybe even publish a book. Why not?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;previous-employment&quot;&gt;Previous Employment&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;I usually don’t pay much attention to this section of your CV. Our management model is &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/04/17/how-xdsd-is-different.html&quot;&gt;so different&lt;/a&gt; from anything you can see anywhere else that it doesn’t really matter how many times you were fired before and how senior of a position you have/had with your full-time employer. Even if your title is “CTO of Twitter”—it doesn’t mean anything to me.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;My experience tells me that the bigger the company and the higher the position in it—the further away you stay from the source code and from real technical decisions. VPs and CTOs spend most of their time on management meetings and internal &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/09/27/command-control-innovate.html&quot;&gt;politics&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I’m much more interested in &lt;strong&gt;what&lt;/strong&gt; you’ve done over the last few years than in &lt;strong&gt;where&lt;/strong&gt; you’ve done it and what they called you while you were doing it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;education&quot;&gt;Education&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;BSc, MSc, PhD… do we care? Not really. Education is very similar to the “previous employment” mentioned above. It doesn’t really matter where exactly you’ve spent those five years after school. What matters is what have you done during that time. If you have nothing to say about your activity in the university than what will the name of it tell me?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Well, of course, if it is Stanford or MIT, this will make a difference. In this case I can see that you managed to pass their graduation standards and managed to find money to study there. This is a good sign and will definitely increase your hourly rate. But if it is some mambo-jambo university from nowhere (like the one I graduated from), keep this information to yourself.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;rates&quot;&gt;Rates&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;$100+&lt;/strong&gt; per hour we gladly pay to an expert who owns a few popular open source products; has a StackOverflow score above 20K; has certifications, articles, presentations, and maybe even patents.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;$50+&lt;/strong&gt; per hour we pay to a professional programmer who has open source projects on his own or is an active contributor; has a StackOverflow score over 5K; is writing about software development; possesses a few certifications.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;$30+&lt;/strong&gt; per hour we pay to a programmer who regularly contributes to open source code; is present in StackOverflow; has some certifications.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;$15&lt;/strong&gt; per hour we pay to everybody else.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Don’t get me wrong and don’t take these numbers personally. The rate you’re getting is a measurable metric of your professional level, not of you as a person. Besides, the level is not static, it is changing every day, and it’s entirely in your hands.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I wrote this article mostly in order to motivate you to grow.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;All these criteria are applicable to new members of our teams. Once you start writing some code, we measure your performance and you may get completely different numbers, see &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/04/20/how-hourly-rate-is-calculated.html&quot;&gt;How Hourly Rate Is Calculated&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;BTW, illustrations you see above are created by &lt;a href=&quot;http://andreeamironiuc.com/&quot;&gt;Andreea Mironiuc&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; "/> <meta

few emails every day from programmers interested in working with <a href="https://www.zerocracy.com">Zerocracy</a> remotely. The first question I usually ask is “what is your rate?” (we pay <a href="/2014/04/17/how-xdsd-is-different.html">by the hour</a>) What surprises me is how often people incorrectly estimate themselves, in both directions.</p><p>I hear very different numbers, from $5 to $500 per hour. I never say no, but usually come up with my own hourly rate estimate. This article explains what factors I do and don’t take into account. These are my personal criteria; don’t take them as an industry standard. I do find them objective and logical, though—so let me explain.</p><h2 id="open-source-contribution">Open Source Contribution</h2><figure class="badge"><img src="https://www.yegor256.com/images/2014/11/rate-open-source-contribution.png" style="width:350px;max-width:100%;" alt="badge" /></figure><p>This is the first and the most important characteristic of a software developer. Do you contribute to open source projects? Do you have your own <a href="/2015/12/22/why-dont-you-contribute-to-open-source.html">open source</a> libraries that are used by some community? Do you write code that is publicly available and used?</p><p>If you have nothing to show here, I see three possible causes.</p><aside class="youtube"> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GS45LzE3LPQ"><div class="box"> <img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GS45LzE3LPQ/mqdefault.jpg" alt="YouTube video #GS45LzE3LPQ" /><div class="play"><i class="icon icon-play"></i></div></div></a><div>How Much Do You Cost?; 27 May 2017.</div></aside><p>First, you’re <strong>too shy to share</strong> your code because <strong>it’s crap</strong>. <a href="/2015/12/22/why-dont-you-contribute-to-open-source.html">Obviously</a>, this is not a good sign. Not because your code could be bad, but because you’re not brave enough to face this fact and improve. In our teams we <a href="/2014/08/13/strict-code-quality-control.html">pay a lot of attention</a> to the <a href="/2017/04/11/flexibility-equates-lower-quality.html">quality</a> of code and most of our new team members get surprised by just how high our quality bar is. You will also be surprised. The question is whether you will be able to adapt and improve or if you will give up and quit. If you didn’t share your code before and have never dealt with negative feedback, you won’t feel comfortable in our projects, where quality requirements are very high.</p><aside class="quote">You're not able to at least find and fix one bug in some open source product you're using?</aside><p>The second possible cause is that you work from nine till five, for food, <strong>without passion</strong>. Actually, nobody manifests it that way. Instead, I often hear something like “my company doesn’t pay me for open source contribution and at home I want to spend time with my family.” In modern software development, most of the code we’re working with is open source—libraries, frameworks, tools, instruments, etc. Almost everything you’re using in your commercial projects is open source. By paying your salary your employer does already invest in open source products, because you’re an active user of them. The problem is that <em>you</em> are not interested in becoming more active in that contribution. I see this as a lack of passion and self-motivation. Will you be an effective developer in our projects? Not at all, because our entire management model relies on <a href="/2014/04/17/how-xdsd-is-different.html">self-motivation</a>.</p><aside class="youtube"> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mfo_FHL3PE"><div class="box"> <img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6mfo_FHL3PE/mqdefault.jpg" alt="YouTube video #6mfo_FHL3PE" /><div class="play"><i class="icon icon-play"></i></div></div></a><div>How we decide how much to pay programmers?; 18 December 2017.</div></aside><p>The last possible cause is that you don’t know what to write and where to contribute, which means <strong>lack of creativity</strong>. As I mentioned above, almost everything we’re using now is open source, and these tools are full of bugs and not-yet-implemented features. At the same time, you don’t see any areas for improvement? You don’t know what can be done better? You’re not able to at least find, report and fix one bug in some open source product you’re using every day? This means that you won’t be able to find areas of improvement in our projects either, while we rely on your ability to <a href="/2014/04/13/bugs-are-welcome.html">discover problems creatively</a>.</p><p>Thus, if your GitHub account is empty and your CV doesn’t position you as “an active contributor to Linux kernel” (yeah, why not?), I immediately lose interest. On the other hand, when I see a 100+ stars project in your GitHub account, I get excited and ready to offer a higher rate.</p><h2 id="geographic-location">Geographic Location</h2><p>It is a common practice to pay higher rates to those who live in more expensive countries. When I’m getting resumes from San Francisco programmers, their rates are $70+ per hour. The same skills and experience cost $15-20 in Karachi. The reason here is the cost of living—it is much higher in the US than in Pakistan.</p><aside class="quote">We prefer to work with people whose expenses are lower</aside><p>However, this reason doesn’t sound logical to me. If you’re driving a more expensive car, we have to pay you a <a href="/2016/12/06/how-to-pay-programmers-less.html">higher salary</a>? The same with the place to stay. You’ve chosen the country that you live in. You’re using all the benefits of a well-developed country and you’re paying for them. It’s your choice. You decided to spend more money for the quality of your life—what does it have to do with me?</p><p>Want to pay $30 for a lunch? Become a better engineer. Until then, buy a hot dog for a few bucks. Just saying that “I’m already here and my lunch costs $30” is not an argument.</p><p>Thus, the more expensive the place you live, the less money stays in your pocket. For us this means that $100 will motivate a programmer from Karachi much stronger than the same $100 will motivate the same person, if she lives in San Francisco. Thus, we prefer to work with people whose expenses are lower. Our money will simply work better.</p><h2 id="stackoverflowcom-reputation">StackOverflow.com Reputation</h2><p>We all know what StackOverflow has but very few people (surprisingly few!) actively contributing to it. If your profile there is empty (or you don’t have one) I realize that you 1) don’t have any questions to ask and 2) you have nothing to answer.</p><p>First, if you’re not asking anything there, you are not growing. Your education process stopped some time ago, probably right after you got an <a href="/2015/10/06/how-to-be-good-office-slave.html">office job</a>. Or maybe you’re too shy to ask? Or you can’t describe your questions in an accurate and precise format? Or maybe all your questions already have answers? In any case, it’s sad.</p><aside class="quote">SO reputation is proof that you can find answers to your questions by communicating with people you don't know</aside><p>Second, if you’re not answering, you simply have nothing to say. In most cases, this means that you’re not solving complex and unique problems. You’re simply wiring together well-known components and collecting your paychecks.</p><p>Very often I hear people saying that they solve most of their problems by asking their colleagues sitting next to them in the <a href="/2015/10/06/how-to-be-good-office-slave.html">office</a>. They say they simply don’t need StackOverflow (or similar resources, if they exist) because their team is so great that any questions can be answered internally. That’s good for the team and bad for you. Why? You don’t have a very important skill—finding an answer in a public Internet. In our projects we <a href="/2014/10/07/stop-chatting-start-coding.html">discourage</a> any horizontal <a href="/2016/08/23/communication-maturity.html">communications</a> between programmers, and you won’t be able to get any help from anyone. You will be on your own and you will fail, because you are used to be patronized by someone senior, in your <a href="/2015/10/06/how-to-be-good-office-slave.html">office</a>.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">How much would you charge per hour, for a remote part-time consulting gig? <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/freelance?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#freelance</a></p>--- Yegor Bugayenko (@yegor256) <a href="https://twitter.com/yegor256/status/993162626497699840?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 6, 2018</a></blockquote> <script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script><p><a href="/2017/02/14/stackoverflow-is-your-tool.html">StackOverflow</a> is not just an indicator of how smart you are and how many upvotes you got for the “<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/234075/what-is-your-best-programmer-joke">best programming joke</a>.” It is proof that you can find answers to your questions by communicating with people you don’t know. It is a very important skill.</p><h2 id="years-of-experience">Years of Experience</h2><figure class="badge"><img src="https://www.yegor256.com/images/2014/11/rate-years-of-experience.png" style="width:350px;max-width:100%;" alt="badge" /></figure><p>“I’ve written Java for 10 years!”—so what? This number means only one thing to me—you managed to survive in some office for ten years. Or maybe in a few offices. You managed to convince someone that he has to pay you for ten years of sitting in his building. Does it mean that you were writing something useful? Does it mean that your code was perfect? It doesn’t mean any of that.</p><p>Years of experience is a false indicator. It actually may play against you, in combination with other indicators mentioned above. If your CV says that you just started to program two years ago and your GitHub and StackOverflow accounts are empty—there is still a chance you will improve. You’re just in the beginning of your career. However, if your CV says that you’re a “10-year seasoned architect” with zero open source contribution—this means that you’re either lying about that ten years or you’re <a href="/2015/09/29/mayonnaise.html">absolutely useless</a> as an architect.</p><p>My point is that the “years of experience” argument should be used very carefully. Play this card only if you have other merits. Otherwise, keep it to yourself.</p><h2 id="certifications">Certifications</h2><figure class="badge"><img src="https://www.yegor256.com/images/2014/11/rate-certifications.png" style="width:350px;max-width:100%;" alt="badge" /></figure><p>Oracle, Zend, Amazon, IBM, MySQL, etc.—I’m talking about these certifications. In order to get them you should pass an exam. Not an easy one and not online. It is a real exam taken in a certification center, where you’re sitting in front of a computer for a few hours, without any books or Internet access, answering questions. Rather humiliating activity for a respected software developer? Indeed. And there is a high probability of failure, which is also rather embarrassing.</p><p>It is a very good sign, if you managed to go through this. If you’ve done it a few times, even better. However, if you’ve earned no certifications in your entire <a href="/2017/01/24/career-advice.html">career</a>, it is for one of the following reasons:</p><p>First, you’re <strong>afraid to lose</strong>. A serious certification may cost a few hundred dollars (I paid over $700 for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_Certification_Program">SCEA</a>) and you will not get a refund if you fail.

Do you contribute to open source projects? Do you have your own <a href="/2015/12/22/why-dont-you-contribute-to-open-source.html">open source</a> libraries that are used by some community? Do you write code that is publicly available and used?</p><p>If you have nothing to show here, I see three possible causes.</p><aside class="youtube"> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GS45LzE3LPQ"><div class="box"> <img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GS45LzE3LPQ/mqdefault.jpg" alt="YouTube video #GS45LzE3LPQ" /><div class="play"><i class="icon icon-play"></i></div></div></a><div>How Much Do You Cost?; 27 May 2017.</div></aside><p>First, you’re <strong>too shy to share</strong> your code because <strong>it’s crap</strong>. <a href="/2015/12/22/why-dont-you-contribute-to-open-source.html">Obviously</a>, this is not a good sign. Not because your code could be bad, but because you’re not brave enough to face this fact and improve. In our teams we <a href="/2014/08/13/strict-code-quality-control.html">pay a lot of attention</a> to the <a href="/2017/04/11/flexibility-equates-lower-quality.html">quality</a> of code and most of our new team members get surprised by just how high our quality bar is. You will also be surprised. The question is whether you will be able to adapt and improve or if you will give up and quit. If you didn’t share your code before and have never dealt with negative feedback, you won’t feel comfortable in our projects, where quality requirements are very high.</p><aside class="quote">You're not able to at least find and fix one bug in some open source product you're using?</aside><p>The second possible cause is that you work from nine till five, for food, <strong>without passion</strong>. Actually, nobody manifests it that way. Instead, I often hear something like “my company doesn’t pay me for open source contribution and at home I want to spend time with my family.” In modern software development, most of the code we’re working with is open source—libraries, frameworks, tools, instruments, etc. Almost everything you’re using in your commercial projects is open source. By paying your salary your employer does already invest in open source products, because you’re an active user of them. The problem is that <em>you</em> are not interested in becoming more active in that contribution. I see this as a lack of passion and self-motivation. Will you be an effective developer in our projects? Not at all, because our entire management model relies on <a href="/2014/04/17/how-xdsd-is-different.html">self-motivation</a>.</p><aside class="youtube"> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mfo_FHL3PE"><div class="box"> <img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6mfo_FHL3PE/mqdefault.jpg" alt="YouTube video #6mfo_FHL3PE" /><div class="play"><i class="icon icon-play"></i></div></div></a><div>How we decide how much to pay programmers?; 18 December 2017.</div></aside><p>The last possible cause is that you don’t know what to write and where to contribute, which means <strong>lack of creativity</strong>. As I mentioned above, almost everything we’re using now is open source, and these tools are full of bugs and not-yet-implemented features. At the same time, you don’t see any areas for improvement? You don’t know what can be done better? You’re not able to at least find, report and fix one bug in some open source product you’re using every day? This means that you won’t be able to find areas of improvement in our projects either, while we rely on your ability to <a href="/2014/04/13/bugs-are-welcome.html">discover problems creatively</a>.</p><p>Thus, if your GitHub account is empty and your CV doesn’t position you as “an active contributor to Linux kernel” (yeah, why not?), I immediately lose interest. On the other hand, when I see a 100+ stars project in your GitHub account, I get excited and ready to offer a higher rate.</p><h2 id="geographic-location">Geographic Location</h2><p>It is a common practice to pay higher rates to those who live in more expensive countries. When I’m getting resumes from San Francisco programmers, their rates are $70+ per hour. The same skills and experience cost $15-20 in Karachi. The reason here is the cost of living—it is much higher in the US than in Pakistan.</p><aside class="quote">We prefer to work with people whose expenses are lower</aside><p>However, this reason doesn’t sound logical to me. If you’re driving a more expensive car, we have to pay you a <a href="/2016/12/06/how-to-pay-programmers-less.html">higher salary</a>? The same with the place to stay. You’ve chosen the country that you live in. You’re using all the benefits of a well-developed country and you’re paying for them. It’s your choice. You decided to spend more money for the quality of your life—what does it have to do with me?</p><p>Want to pay $30 for a lunch? Become a better engineer. Until then, buy a hot dog for a few bucks. Just saying that “I’m already here and my lunch costs $30” is not an argument.</p><p>Thus, the more expensive the place you live, the less money stays in your pocket. For us this means that $100 will motivate a programmer from Karachi much stronger than the same $100 will motivate the same person, if she lives in San Francisco. Thus, we prefer to work with people whose expenses are lower. Our money will simply work better.</p><h2 id="stackoverflowcom-reputation">StackOverflow.com Reputation</h2><p>We all know what StackOverflow has but very few people (surprisingly few!) actively contributing to it. If your profile there is empty (or you don’t have one) I realize that you 1) don’t have any questions to ask and 2) you have nothing to answer.</p><p>First, if you’re not asking anything there, you are not growing. Your education process stopped some time ago, probably right after you got an <a href="/2015/10/06/how-to-be-good-office-slave.html">office job</a>. Or maybe you’re too shy to ask? Or you can’t describe your questions in an accurate and precise format? Or maybe all your questions already have answers? In any case, it’s sad.</p><aside class="quote">SO reputation is proof that you can find answers to your questions by communicating with people you don't know</aside><p>Second, if you’re not answering, you simply have nothing to say. In most cases, this means that you’re not solving complex and unique problems. You’re simply wiring together well-known components and collecting your paychecks.</p><p>Very often I hear people saying that they solve most of their problems by asking their colleagues sitting next to them in the <a href="/2015/10/06/how-to-be-good-office-slave.html">office</a>. They say they simply don’t need StackOverflow (or similar resources, if they exist) because their team is so great that any questions can be answered internally. That’s good for the team and bad for you. Why? You don’t have a very important skill—finding an answer in a public Internet. In our projects we <a href="/2014/10/07/stop-chatting-start-coding.html">discourage</a> any horizontal <a href="/2016/08/23/communication-maturity.html">communications</a> between programmers, and you won’t be able to get any help from anyone.

This number means only one thing to me—you managed to survive in some office for ten years. Or maybe in a few offices. You managed to convince someone that he has to pay you for ten years of sitting in his building. Does it mean that you were writing something useful? Does it mean that your code was perfect? It doesn’t mean any of that.</p><p>Years of experience is a false indicator. It actually may play against you, in combination with other indicators mentioned above. If your CV says that you just started to program two years ago and your GitHub and StackOverflow accounts are empty—there is still a chance you will improve. You’re just in the beginning of your career. However, if your CV says that you’re a “10-year seasoned architect” with zero open source contribution—this means that you’re either lying about that ten years or you’re <a href="/2015/09/29/mayonnaise.html">absolutely useless</a> as an architect.</p><p>My point is that the “years of experience” argument should be used very carefully.

In order to get them you should pass an exam. Not an easy one and not online. It is a real exam taken in a certification center, where you’re sitting in front of a computer for a few hours, without any books or Internet access, answering questions. Rather humiliating activity for a respected software developer? Indeed. And there is a high probability of failure, which is also rather embarrassing.</p><p>It is a very good sign, if you managed to go through this. If you’ve done it a few times, even better. However, if you’ve earned no certifications in your entire <a href="/2017/01/24/career-advice.html">career</a>, it is for one of the following reasons:</p><p>First, you’re <strong>afraid to lose</strong>. A serious certification may cost a few hundred dollars (I paid over $700 for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_Certification_Program">SCEA</a>) and you will not get a refund if you fail.
