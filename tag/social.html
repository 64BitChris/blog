in Silicon Valley, which led to serious career problems for &lt;a href=&quot;https://500hats.com/im-a-creep-i-m-sorry-d2c13e996ea0&quot;&gt;Dave McClure&lt;/a&gt; (former CEO of &lt;a

Let’s try to put emotions aside and analyze what’s happening and what long-term consequences this panic may have for our male-dominated engineering environment.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;!--more--&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;jb_picture&quot;&gt;&lt;img itemprop=&quot;image&quot; alt=&quot;Twentynine Palms (2003) by Bruno Dumont&quot; src=&quot;/images/2017/07/twentynine-palms.jpg&quot; longdesc=&quot;#c014ddd9&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption id=&quot;c014ddd9&quot;&gt;Twentynine Palms (2003) by Bruno Dumont&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;We will never know what really happened between those male investors and female entrepreneurs behind closed doors, but the gist of the accusation is that the former were &lt;em&gt;making advances&lt;/em&gt; towards the latter, where it was clearly &lt;em&gt;inappropriate&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What does that mean exactly? What, for example, did Dave McClure do in order to be kicked out of the company he founded?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Let’s see. According to Katie Benner from The New York Times, he sent &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/30/technology/women-entrepreneurs-speak-out-sexual-harassment.html&quot;&gt;this message&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/sarahkunst&quot;&gt;Sarah Kunst&lt;/a&gt;, who was an applicant at his incubator in 2014 (other “harassers” were accused of doing something very similar):&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;I was getting confused figuring out whether to hire you or hit on you.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Obviously he was flirting. And what’s wrong with that? Can’t we flirt any more? Is it a crime all of a sudden? One thing is wrong though. It was a &lt;em&gt;threat&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Even though this message didn’t say it explicitly, it actually &lt;em&gt;implied&lt;/em&gt; that “you either go along and we go out, or you won’t be hired.” Of course, “no hire” may not hurt as much as a knife or a fist in the face, but it does hurt. Especially if you are a woman, a member of a minority group.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I’m a &lt;del&gt;sexist&lt;/del&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;/2017/07/04/sexism.html&quot;&gt;gentleman&lt;/a&gt;, I feel bad when I see women being threatened. I want to protect them and I expect our system of justice to help me, just like it helps when we deal with physical violence. These threats or attempts to threaten must be punished.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There is nothing wrong with the game between the sexes by itself. Just like we don’t prohibit sex because we are afraid of rapists, we must not stop asking women out because of our fear of a possible harassment accusation. However, it seems that this is what is happening now: men are becoming &lt;em&gt;afraid&lt;/em&gt; of women. Especially powerful men with money and status. They realize that a small incautious step may help them become the next Dave or Travis.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This fear is destroying us.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thanks to this fear our &lt;em&gt;masculine&lt;/em&gt; characteristics become a victim of this dangerous game that society is playing right now, with a noble intent to protect women against verbal and psychological abuse. We men are losing our self-confidence, our self-esteem, our &lt;del&gt;balls&lt;/del&gt; courage.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This fear mentally castrates us.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We must be absolutely clear that those harassers are guilty not because they “made advances” towards women who work with them or for them, but because they were &lt;em&gt;threatening&lt;/em&gt; those ladies. There is nothing wrong in being attracted to a woman, no matter who she is: your boss, your employee, your schoolmate, or the founder of the business you’re investing in. Moreover, there is nothing wrong in making advances, falling in love, having sex and marrying them. Threatening them in order to get all that is very wrong.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Not every flirtation is harassment. Not every man with a sexual instinct is a rapist.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;How would I re-phrase that message to Sarah if I had been Dave and had fallen in love with her at first sight? I would probably say:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;I was getting confused, figuring out how to isolate my hiring process from my desire to hit on you. How about dinner? I promise, no matter how it ends, it will not affect our hiring decision at all.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;I realize that it’s not perfect, since she wouldn’t be completely comfortable, and still might expect Dave’s feelings to affect his hiring decision if it turns out she doesn’t like him or simply already has a partner. However, this would seem like a respectful attempt to put the weapon down.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is difficult to not threaten a woman if you’re holding a gun in your hand while asking her out. Money and power is the gun.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Guys, let’s be very careful. However, let’s not forget how to seduce women and fall in love with them. We have to stay men, especially when some of those among us are weak abusers deserving no respect.&lt;/p&gt; " /> <meta name="keywords" content="next, path, output, content, previous, url, relative_path, id, collection, excerpt, draft, categories, layout, title, date, place, tags, description, keywords, index, image, jb_picture, buffer, slug, ext" /> <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1"/> <meta name="google-site-verification" content="JEj_gQr2CPe2QKGw8XdMz0R7VboQIUbX3FlM-lwTq-8" /> <meta name="author" content="Yegor Bugayenko"> <meta name="article:published_time" content="2017-07-18 00:00:00 +0000"> <meta name="og:site_name" content="Yegor Bugayenko"/> <meta name="og:type" content="article" /> <meta name="og:locale" content="en_US" /> <meta name="twitter:account_id" content="4503599630178231" /> <meta name="twitter:creator" content="@yegor256"/> <meta name="twitter:site" content="@yegor256"/> <meta name="twitter:title" property="og:title" content="The Bigger Victim of Sexual Harassment"/> <meta name="twitter:description" property="og:description" content="&lt;p&gt;You most probably are aware of the recent sexual harassment &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/30/technology/women-entrepreneurs-speak-out-sexual-harassment.html?_r=0&quot;&gt;scandals&lt;/a&gt; in Silicon Valley, which led to serious career problems for &lt;a href=&quot;https://500hats.com/im-a-creep-i-m-sorry-d2c13e996ea0&quot;&gt;Dave McClure&lt;/a&gt; (former CEO of &lt;a href=&quot;https://500.co/&quot;&gt;500 Startups&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/19/business/uber-sexual-harassment-investigation.html&quot;&gt;Travis Kalanick&lt;/a&gt; (former CEO of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.uber.com&quot;&gt;Uber&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@sacca/i-have-more-work-to-do-c775c5d56ca1&quot;&gt;Chris Sacca&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/news/2017/06/30/venture-capital-sexual-harassment-scandal/103336512/&quot;&gt;a few others&lt;/a&gt;.

I believe I owe my readers an explanation. Some of them already got confused and came to me with the question: “If you’re so much against slavery, where is this male chauvinism coming from?” Let me explain what’s going on. Indeed I am a big fan of &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/07/21/hourly-pay-modern-slavery.html&quot;&gt;freedom&lt;/a&gt;, but &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKcWu0tsiZM&amp;amp;t=1s&quot;&gt;recent hysteria&lt;/a&gt; around &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_equality&quot;&gt;gender equality&lt;/a&gt; is not helping us to become more free. Instead it is causing quite the opposite effect.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;!--more--&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;jb_picture&quot;&gt;&lt;img itemprop=&quot;image&quot; alt=&quot;Conversations with Other Women (2005) by Hans Canosa&quot; src=&quot;/images/2017/07/conversations-with-other-women.jpg&quot; longdesc=&quot;#ca72484b&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption id=&quot;ca72484b&quot;&gt;Conversations with Other Women (2005) by Hans Canosa&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;When I was a kid my parents and my teachers told me that I had to be a gentleman. That literally meant that I had to treat women with respect and always remember that they were weaker than us men—physically and emotionally.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I had to open the door for them, I was not allowed to fight with them as I did with my male friends, I was punished for cursing in front of them, and many other things. I did all this not only because of what I was taught, but also because I saw that they indeed were weaker. They were physically and emotionally different from us boys. They played dolls, we played wars. They wore pink and white skirts and blouses, we wore shorts and t-shirts. They cried when someone was offending them and we were supposed to be stronger, never to cry, and to protect them. It was always obvious that we were the troublemakers, but also the protectors, who those little creatures eventually one day would marry.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now it seems that I was raised as a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexism&quot;&gt;sexist&lt;/a&gt;. But do I feel ashamed? Not at all.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Do I believe that gender equality is about making men and women fully equal in all aspects of life? Not at all.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We must &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; be equal, because we are different.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Such inequalities are only making us more human. We need them.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are many other categories of people in modern societies who possess special rights or are not allowed to do certain things. Simply put, they experience &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination&quot;&gt;discrimination&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;but for their good&lt;/em&gt;. For example, kids are not allowed to buy alcohol and watch porn. Senior citizens receive pensions even though they don’t work any more. People with disabilities sit in a bus where everybody else is not allowed to. Such &lt;em&gt;inequalities&lt;/em&gt; are only making us more human. We need them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The same is true for the “category” of people I was taught to respect and protect: women. And no matter what extreme &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feminism&quot;&gt;feminists&lt;/a&gt; say, I will remain the same. I do believe in inequality between men and women. I want to see us as gentlemen and ladies. Not just genderless people.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thanks to this inequality men find women attractive, fall in love with them, marry them and make kids. Thanks to this inequality many years ago my dad asked my mom out, &lt;a href=&quot;/2017/07/18/sexual-harassment.html&quot;&gt;kissed her&lt;/a&gt;, proposed, and brought me into this world.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now back to the main problem: women in tech. I’m a programmer myself. I write and debug code every day. I also manage programmers and projects. My 20+ years of experience in coding tells me that this job is not fun most of the time. It’s hard, it requires a lot of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/science/2013/dec/02/men-women-brains-wired-differently&quot;&gt;rigid logical thinking&lt;/a&gt;, it’s rather boring, and it’s a constant war against machines and against other programmers who produce unmaintainable and unreadable code.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;I also personally don't like the idea of women being police officers, soldiers, surgeons, or firefighters.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;I don’t feel good about sending women, who I was raised to protect and respect, into this war. I also personally don’t like the idea of women being police officers, soldiers, surgeons, or firefighters, even though it’s not up to me to decide what they do for a living. Those jobs are stressful and dangerous, both physically and emotionally. Not that I believe that women can’t take this stress, I just don’t want them to suffer. There are plenty of gentlemen who can do that instead.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Do I respect women who write code on a daily basis? Yes, a lot. Because I understand how much stress they have to go through. Would I recommend my girlfriend do the same. I don’t think so.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Am I a sexist? Maybe so.

That literally meant that I had to treat women with respect and always remember that they were weaker than us men—physically and emotionally.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I had to open the door for them, I was not allowed to fight with them as I did with my male friends, I was punished for cursing in front of them, and many other things. I did all this not only because of what I was taught, but also because I saw that they indeed were weaker. They were physically and emotionally different from us boys. They played dolls, we played wars. They wore pink and white skirts and blouses, we wore shorts and t-shirts. They cried when someone was offending them and we were supposed to be stronger, never to cry, and to protect them. It was always obvious that we were the troublemakers, but also the protectors, who those little creatures eventually one day would marry.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now it seems that I was raised as a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexism&quot;&gt;sexist&lt;/a&gt;.

Simply put, they experience &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination&quot;&gt;discrimination&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;but for their good&lt;/em&gt;. For example, kids are not allowed to buy alcohol and watch porn. Senior citizens receive pensions even though they don’t work any more. People with disabilities sit in a bus where everybody else is not allowed to. Such &lt;em&gt;inequalities&lt;/em&gt; are only making us more human.

Simply put, they experience <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination">discrimination</a>, <em>but for their good</em>. For example, kids are not allowed to buy alcohol and watch porn. Senior citizens receive pensions even though they don’t work any more. People with disabilities sit in a bus where everybody else is not allowed to. Such <em>inequalities</em> are only making us more human. We need them.</p><p>The same is true for the “category” of people I was taught to respect and protect: women. And no matter what extreme <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feminism">feminists</a> say, I will remain the same. I do believe in inequality between men and women. I want to see us as gentlemen and ladies. Not just genderless people.</p><p>Thanks to this inequality men find women attractive, fall in love with them, marry them and make kids. Thanks to this inequality many years ago my dad asked my mom out, <a href="/2017/07/18/sexual-harassment.html">kissed her</a>, proposed, and brought me into this world.</p><p>Now back to the main problem: women in tech. I’m a programmer myself. I write and debug code every day. I also manage programmers and projects. My 20+ years of experience in coding tells me that this job is not fun most of the time. It’s hard, it requires a lot of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2013/dec/02/men-women-brains-wired-differently">rigid logical thinking</a>, it’s rather boring, and it’s a constant war against machines and against other programmers who produce unmaintainable and unreadable code.</p><aside class="quote">I also personally don't like the idea of women being police officers, soldiers, surgeons, or firefighters.</aside><p>I don’t feel good about sending women, who I was raised to protect and respect, into this war. I also personally don’t like the idea of women being police officers, soldiers, surgeons, or firefighters, even though it’s not up to me to decide what they do for a living. Those jobs are stressful and dangerous, both physically and emotionally. Not that I believe that women can’t take this stress, I just don’t want them to suffer. There are plenty of gentlemen who can do that instead.</p><p>Do I respect women who write code on a daily basis? Yes, a lot. Because I understand how much stress they have to go through. Would I recommend my girlfriend do the same. I don’t think so.</p><p>Am I a sexist? Maybe so. But that’s how I was raised. <del>That’s who I am.</del> And I’m proud of it.</p></div></article></div><div class="wrapper"> <related-posts /></div><div class="disqus" role="complementary"><p class="disqus_hint"> Please, use <a href="https://help.disqus.com/commenting/what-html-tags-are-allowed-within-comments">syntax highlighting</a> in your comments, to make them more readable.</p><div id="disqus_thread" class="disqus-thread"> <a>&nbsp;</a></div><script> var disqus_config = function () { this.page.url = document.location.href.split('?')[0].split('#')[0].replace('https://', 'http://'); this.page.identifier = this.page.url; }; (function() { var d = document, s = d.createElement('script'); s.src = '//yegor256.disqus.com/embed.js'; s.setAttribute('data-timestamp', +new Date()); (d.head || d.body).appendChild(s); })(); </script> <noscript><div><p class="red"> JavaScript is disabled in your browser, that's why you can't see comments under this post.</p></div></noscript></div><div class="wrapper"> <footer class="footer"><p> &copy; <span itemscope="" itemprop="copyrightHolder" itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"> <span itemprop="name">Yegor Bugayenko</span> </span> 2014&ndash;<span itemprop="copyrightYear">2018</span></p></footer></div></section><div class="wrapper unprintable" style="text-align:center;margin-top:2em;"> <a href="http://www.sixnines.io/h/3ba1652f"> <img src="//www.sixnines.io/b/3ba1652f?style=flat" alt="sixnines availability badge"/> </a></div><script src="//code.jquery.com/jquery-1.9.0.min.js"></script> <script src="/js/all.js?23bb3130b4f"></script> <script>var disqus_shortname = 'yegor256';</script> <script id="dsq-count-scr" src="//yegor256.disqus.com/count.js" async="async"></script> <script> (function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){ (i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o), m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m) })(window,document,'script','//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga'); ga('create', 'UA-1963507-32', 'auto'); ga('send', 'pageview'); </script> <script> Cd=document;Cr="&"+Math.random();Cp="&s=1"; Cd.cookie="b=b";if(Cd.cookie)Cp+="&c=1"; Cp+="&t="+(new Date()).getTimezoneOffset(); if(self!=top)Cp+="&f=1"; </script> <script> if(navigator.javaEnabled())Cp+="&j=1"; </script> <script> if(typeof(screen)!='undefined')Cp+="&w="+screen.width+"&h="+ screen.height+"&d="+(screen.colorDepth?screen.colorDepth:screen.pixelDepth); </script> <script> Cd.write("<img src='//c.hit.ua/hit?i=95870&g=0&x=2"+Cp+Cr+ "&r="+escape(Cd.referrer)+"&u="+escape(window.location.href)+ "' border='0' wi"+"dth='1' he"+"ight='1'/>"); </script> <script type="application/ld+json"> { "@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Person", "name": "Yegor Bugayenko", "url": "https://www.yegor256.com", "sameAs": [ "https://www.facebook.com/yegor256", "https://instagram.com/yegor256", "https://www.linkedin.com/in/yegor256", "https://twitter.com/yegor256", "https://github.com/yegor256", "https://www.pinterest.com/yegor256/" ] } </script> </body> </html> </article></div></section><div class="wrapper unprintable" style="text-align:center;margin-top:2em;"> <a href="http://www.sixnines.io/h/3ba1652f"> <img src="//www.sixnines.io/b/3ba1652f?style=flat" alt="sixnines availability badge"/> </a></div><script src="//code.jquery.com/jquery-1.9.0.min.js"></script> <script src="/js/all.js?23bb3130b4f"></script> <script>var disqus_shortname = 'yegor256';</script> <script id="dsq-count-scr" src="//yegor256.disqus.com/count.js" async="async"></script> <script> (function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){ (i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o), m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m) })(window,document,'script','//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga'); ga('create', 'UA-1963507-32', 'auto'); ga('send', 'pageview'); </script> <script> Cd=document;Cr="&"+Math.random();Cp="&s=1"; Cd.cookie="b=b";if(Cd.cookie)Cp+="&c=1"; Cp+="&t="+(new Date()).getTimezoneOffset(); if(self!=top)Cp+="&f=1"; </script> <script> if(navigator.javaEnabled())Cp+="&j=1"; </script> <script> if(typeof(screen)!='undefined')Cp+="&w="+screen.width+"&h="+ screen.height+"&d="+(screen.colorDepth?screen.colorDepth:screen.pixelDepth); </script> <script> Cd.write("<img src='//c.hit.ua/hit?i=95870&g=0&x=2"+Cp+Cr+ "&r="+escape(Cd.referrer)+"&u="+escape(window.location.href)+ "' border='0' wi"+"dth='1' he"+"ight='1'/>"); </script> <script type="application/ld+json"> { "@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Person", "name": "Yegor Bugayenko", "url": "https://www.yegor256.com", "sameAs": [ "https://www.facebook.com/yegor256", "https://instagram.com/yegor256", "https://www.linkedin.com/in/yegor256", "https://twitter.com/yegor256", "https://github.com/yegor256", "https://www.pinterest.com/yegor256/" ] } </script> </body> </html>
