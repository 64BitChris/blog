href=&quot;https://twitter.com/BrianGoetz&quot;&gt;Brian Goetz&lt;/a&gt; for data classes in Java, and immediately realized that I too have a few ideas about how to make Java better as a language. I actually have many of them, but this is a short list of the five most important.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;!--more--&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;jb_picture&quot;&gt;&lt;img itemprop=&quot;image&quot; alt=&quot;Idiocracy (2006) by Mike Judge&quot; src=&quot;/images/2017/11/idiocracy.jpg&quot; longdesc=&quot;#07fb0c2a&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption id=&quot;07fb0c2a&quot;&gt;Idiocracy (2006) by Mike Judge&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Global Variables&lt;/strong&gt;. There are &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton_pattern&quot;&gt;Singletons&lt;/a&gt; in Java, which, as we all know, are nothing but &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_variable&quot;&gt;global variables&lt;/a&gt;. Wouldn’t it be great to enable global variables in Java and get rid of Singletons. PHP, JavaScript, Ruby and many other languages have them, why doesn’t Java? Look at this code:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;User&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;User&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;INSTANCE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;User&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;User&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;getInstance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;synchronized&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;User&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;INSTANCE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;User&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;INSTANCE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;User&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;INSTANCE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;User&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;User&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;INSTANCE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;getName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// return user&amp;#39;s name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Then, to access it we have to use:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;User&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;getInstance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;().&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;getName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is a Singleton. See how verbose it is? We can simply replace it with a global variable (&lt;code&gt;global&lt;/code&gt; is the keyword I’m suggesting we use):&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;global&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;User&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;And then:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;getName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Much less code to write, and way easier to read!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;global-functions-and-namespaces&quot;&gt;Global Functions and Namespaces&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;To group static methods together we create &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/05/05/oop-alternative-to-utility-classes.html&quot;&gt;utility classes&lt;/a&gt;, where we have to define private constructors to prevent their instantiation. Also, we have to remember which particular utility class a static method is in. It’s just extra hassle. I’m suggesting we add global functions to Java and optional “namespaces” to group them. Take a look at this utility class:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;TextUtils&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;TextUtils&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;trim&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;text&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;trim&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now look at this global function with a namespace:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;namespace&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;TextUtils&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;trim&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;text&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;trim&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;My point is that since we are already using classes as collections of functions, let’s make it more convenient. In some applications we won’t even need namespaces, just global functions, like in C and C++.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;full-access-to-private-attributes-and-methods&quot;&gt;Full Access to Private Attributes and Methods&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;In order to access a private attribute or a method of an object from outside we have to use the &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/reflect/&quot;&gt;Reflection API&lt;/a&gt;. It’s not particularly difficult, but it does take a few lines of code, which are not so easy to read and understand:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Point&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Point&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;point&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Point&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Field&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;field&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;point&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;getClass&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;().&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;getDeclaredField&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;x&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;field&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;setAccessible&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;field&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;point&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;I’m suggesting we allow any object to access any of the attributes and methods of another object:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Point&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;point&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Point&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;point&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Of course, if they are private, the compiler will issue a warning. At compile time you simply ignore the warning and move on. If you really care about encapsulation, pay attention to the warning and do something else. But in most cases programmers will ignore it, since they would happily use the Reflection API anyway.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;null-by-default&quot;&gt;NULL by Default&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;It would be convenient to let us call constructors and methods with an incomplete set of arguments. The arguments we don’t provide will be set to &lt;code&gt;null&lt;/code&gt; by default. Also, when a method has to return something, but there is no &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt; statement, Java should return &lt;code&gt;null&lt;/code&gt;. This is almost exactly how it works in PHP, Ruby, and many other languages. I believe it would be a convenient feature for Java &lt;del&gt;monkeys&lt;/del&gt; developers too.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We won’t need to define so many methods when some of the arguments are optional. &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/methods.html&quot;&gt;Method overloading&lt;/a&gt; is very verbose and difficult to understand. Instead, we should have one method with a long list of arguments. Some of them will be provided by the caller, others will be set to &lt;code&gt;null&lt;/code&gt;. The method will decide what to do, for example:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;save&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;File&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;file&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;encoding&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;encoding&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;encoding&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;UTF-8&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Then we just call either &lt;code&gt;save(f)&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;save(f, &quot;UTF-16&quot;)&lt;/code&gt;. The method will understand what we mean. We can also make it even more convenient, like it’s done in Ruby, providing method arguments by names:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;save&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;file&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;encoding&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;UTF-16&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Also, when there is nothing to return, the method must return &lt;code&gt;null&lt;/code&gt; by default. Writing &lt;code&gt;return null&lt;/code&gt; is just a waste of a code line and doesn’t really improve readability. Take a look:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;load&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;File&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;file&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;file&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;exists&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;())&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;read_the_content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s obvious from this code that if the file exists, the method loads and returns its content. If not, it returns &lt;code&gt;null&lt;/code&gt;, which will be a good indicator for the caller that something is not right and the content of the file is not available.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;getters-and-setters&quot;&gt;Getters and Setters&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;I think it’s only obvious that we need this feature: every private attribute must automatically have &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/09/16/getters-and-setters-are-evil.html&quot;&gt;a setter and a getter&lt;/a&gt;. There should be no need to create them, Java will provide them out-of-the-box, just like &lt;a href=&quot;https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/properties.html&quot;&gt;Kotlin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rubyist.net/~slagell/ruby/accessors.html&quot;&gt;Ruby&lt;/a&gt; do. What is the point of having an attribute if there are no getters and setters to read it and to modify it, right?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With this new feature we’ll no longer need the help of &lt;a href=&quot;https://projectlombok.org/features/GetterSetter&quot;&gt;Lombok&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/generating-getters-and-setters.html&quot;&gt;IntelliJ IDEA&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;hr /&gt; &lt;p&gt;Maybe I should turn my ideas into official proposals to &lt;a href=&quot;https://jcp.org/en/participation/committee&quot;&gt;JCP&lt;/a&gt;.

Wouldn’t it be great to enable global variables in Java and get rid of Singletons. PHP, JavaScript, Ruby and many other languages have them, why doesn’t Java? Look at this code:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;User&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;User&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;INSTANCE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;User&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;User&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;getInstance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;synchronized&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;User&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;INSTANCE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;User&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;INSTANCE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;User&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;INSTANCE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;User&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;User&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;INSTANCE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;getName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// return user&amp;#39;s name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Then, to access it we have to use:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;User&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;getInstance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;().&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;getName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is a Singleton. See how verbose it is? We can simply replace it with a global variable (&lt;code&gt;global&lt;/code&gt; is the keyword I’m suggesting we use):&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;global&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;User&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;And then:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;getName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Much less code to write, and way easier to read!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;global-functions-and-namespaces&quot;&gt;Global Functions and Namespaces&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;To group static methods together we create &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/05/05/oop-alternative-to-utility-classes.html&quot;&gt;utility classes&lt;/a&gt;, where we have to define private constructors to prevent their instantiation. Also, we have to remember which particular utility class a static method is in. It’s just extra hassle. I’m suggesting we add global functions to Java and optional “namespaces” to group them. Take a look at this utility class:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;TextUtils&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;TextUtils&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;trim&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;text&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;trim&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now look at this global function with a namespace:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;namespace&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;TextUtils&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;trim&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;text&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;trim&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;My point is that since we are already using classes as collections of functions, let’s make it more convenient. In some applications we won’t even need namespaces, just global functions, like in C and C++.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;full-access-to-private-attributes-and-methods&quot;&gt;Full Access to Private Attributes and Methods&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;In order to access a private attribute or a method of an object from outside we have to use the &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/reflect/&quot;&gt;Reflection API&lt;/a&gt;. It’s not particularly difficult, but it does take a few lines of code, which are not so easy to read and understand:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Point&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Point&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;point&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Point&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Field&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;field&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;point&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;getClass&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;().&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;getDeclaredField&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;x&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;field&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;setAccessible&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;field&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;point&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;I’m suggesting we allow any object to access any of the attributes and methods of another object:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Point&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;point&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Point&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;point&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Of course, if they are private, the compiler will issue a warning. At compile time you simply ignore the warning and move on. If you really care about encapsulation, pay attention to the warning and do something else. But in most cases programmers will ignore it, since they would happily use the Reflection API anyway.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;null-by-default&quot;&gt;NULL by Default&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;It would be convenient to let us call constructors and methods with an incomplete set of arguments. The arguments we don’t provide will be set to &lt;code&gt;null&lt;/code&gt; by default. Also, when a method has to return something, but there is no &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt; statement, Java should return &lt;code&gt;null&lt;/code&gt;. This is almost exactly how it works in PHP, Ruby, and many other languages. I believe it would be a convenient feature for Java &lt;del&gt;monkeys&lt;/del&gt; developers too.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We won’t need to define so many methods when some of the arguments are optional. &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/methods.html&quot;&gt;Method overloading&lt;/a&gt; is very verbose and difficult to understand. Instead, we should have one method with a long list of arguments. Some of them will be provided by the caller, others will be set to &lt;code&gt;null&lt;/code&gt;. The method will decide what to do, for example:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;save&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;File&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;file&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;encoding&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;encoding&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;encoding&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;UTF-8&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Then we just call either &lt;code&gt;save(f)&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;save(f, &quot;UTF-16&quot;)&lt;/code&gt;. The method will understand what we mean. We can also make it even more convenient, like it’s done in Ruby, providing method arguments by names:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;save&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;file&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;encoding&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;UTF-16&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Also, when there is nothing to return, the method must return &lt;code&gt;null&lt;/code&gt; by default. Writing &lt;code&gt;return null&lt;/code&gt; is just a waste of a code line and doesn’t really improve readability. Take a look:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;load&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;File&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;file&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;file&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;exists&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;())&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;read_the_content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s obvious from this code that if the file exists, the method loads and returns its content. If not, it returns &lt;code&gt;null&lt;/code&gt;, which will be a good indicator for the caller that something is not right and the content of the file is not available.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;getters-and-setters&quot;&gt;Getters and Setters&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;I think it’s only obvious that we need this feature: every private attribute must automatically have &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/09/16/getters-and-setters-are-evil.html&quot;&gt;a setter and a getter&lt;/a&gt;. There should be no need to create them, Java will provide them out-of-the-box, just like &lt;a href=&quot;https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/properties.html&quot;&gt;Kotlin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rubyist.net/~slagell/ruby/accessors.html&quot;&gt;Ruby&lt;/a&gt; do. What is the point of having an attribute if there are no getters and setters to read it and to modify it, right?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With this new feature we’ll no longer need the help of &lt;a href=&quot;https://projectlombok.org/features/GetterSetter&quot;&gt;Lombok&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/generating-getters-and-setters.html&quot;&gt;IntelliJ IDEA&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;hr /&gt; &lt;p&gt;Maybe I should turn my ideas into official proposals to &lt;a href=&quot;https://jcp.org/en/participation/committee&quot;&gt;JCP&lt;/a&gt;.

Also, we have to remember which particular utility class a static method is in. It’s just extra hassle. I’m suggesting we add global functions to Java and optional “namespaces” to group them. Take a look at this utility class:</p><figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span></span><span class="kd">class</span> <span class="nc">TextUtils</span> <span class="o">{</span>
  <span class="kd">private</span> <span class="nf">TextUtils</span><span class="o">()</span> <span class="o">{}</span>

    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">text</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">trim</span><span class="o">();</span>
  <span class="o">}</span>
<span class="o">}</span></code></pre></figure><p>Now look at this global function with a namespace:</p><figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span></span><span class="n">namespace</span> <span class="n">TextUtils</span> <span class="o">{</span>
  <span class="n">String</span> <span class="nf">trim</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">String</span> <span class="n">text</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">{</span>

      <span class="k">return</span> <span class="s">&quot;&quot;</span><span class="o">;</span>
    <span class="o">}</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">text</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">trim</span><span class="o">();</span>
  <span class="o">}</span>
<span class="o">}</span></code></pre></figure><p>My point is that since we are already using classes as collections of functions, let’s make it more convenient. In some applications we won’t even need namespaces, just global functions, like in C and C++.</p><h2 id="full-access-to-private-attributes-and-methods">Full Access to Private Attributes and Methods</h2><p>In order to access a private attribute or a method of an object from outside we have to use the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/reflect/">Reflection API</a>. It’s not particularly difficult, but it does take a few lines of code, which are not so easy to read and understand:</p><figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span></span><span class="kd">class</span> <span class="nc">Point</span> <span class="o">{</span>

<span class="n">Field</span> <span class="n">field</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">point</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">getClass</span><span class="o">().</span><span class="na">getDeclaredField</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">&quot;x&quot;</span><span class="o">);</span>
<span class="n">field</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">setAccessible</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="kc">true</span><span class="o">);</span>

<span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">point</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">x</span><span class="o">;</span></code></pre></figure><p>Of course, if they are private, the compiler will issue a warning. At compile time you simply ignore the warning and move on. If you really care about encapsulation, pay attention to the warning and do something else. But in most cases programmers will ignore it, since they would happily use the Reflection API anyway.</p><h2 id="null-by-default">NULL by Default</h2><p>It would be convenient to let us call constructors and methods with an incomplete set of arguments. The arguments we don’t provide will be set to <code>null</code> by default. Also, when a method has to return something, but there is no <code>return</code> statement, Java should return <code>null</code>. This is almost exactly how it works in PHP, Ruby, and many other languages. I believe it would be a convenient feature for Java <del>monkeys</del> developers too.</p><p>We won’t need to define so many methods when some of the arguments are optional. <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/methods.html">Method overloading</a> is very verbose and difficult to understand. Instead, we should have one method with a long list of arguments. Some of them will be provided by the caller, others will be set to <code>null</code>. The method will decide what to do, for example:</p><figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span></span><span class="kt">void</span> <span class="nf">save</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">File</span> <span class="n">file</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">String</span> <span class="n">encoding</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">{</span>
 <span class="k">if</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">encoding</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="kc">null</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">{</span>
   <span class="n">encoding</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">&quot;UTF-8&quot;</span><span class="o">;</span>
 <span class="o">}</span>
<span class="o">}</span></code></pre></figure><p>Then we just call either <code>save(f)</code> or <code>save(f, "UTF-16")</code>. The method will understand what we mean. We can also make it even more convenient, like it’s done in Ruby, providing method arguments by names:</p><figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span></span><span class="n">save</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">file</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">f</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">encoding</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="s">&quot;UTF-16&quot;</span><span class="o">);</span></code></pre></figure><p>Also, when there is nothing to return, the method must return <code>null</code> by default. Writing <code>return null</code> is just a waste of a code line and doesn’t really improve readability. Take a look:</p><figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span></span><span class="n">String</span> <span class="nf">load</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">File</span> <span class="n">file</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">{</span>
 <span class="k">if</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">file</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">exists</span><span class="o">())</span> <span class="o">{</span>
   <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">read_the_content</span><span class="o">();</span>
 <span class="o">}</span>
<span class="o">}</span></code></pre></figure><p>It’s obvious from this code that if the file exists, the method loads and returns its content. If not, it returns <code>null</code>, which will be a good indicator for the caller that something is not right and the content of the file is not available.</p><h2 id="getters-and-setters">Getters and Setters</h2><p>I think it’s only obvious that we need this feature: every private attribute must automatically have <a href="/2014/09/16/getters-and-setters-are-evil.html">a setter and a getter</a>. There should be no need to create them, Java will provide them out-of-the-box, just like <a href="https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/properties.html">Kotlin</a> and <a href="http://www.rubyist.net/~slagell/ruby/accessors.html">Ruby</a> do. What is the point of having an attribute if there are no getters and setters to read it and to modify it, right?</p><p>With this new feature we’ll no longer need the help of <a href="https://projectlombok.org/features/GetterSetter">Lombok</a>, or <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/generating-getters-and-setters.html">IntelliJ IDEA</a>.</p><hr /><p>Maybe I should turn my ideas into official proposals to <a href="https://jcp.org/en/participation/committee">JCP</a>.

Also, we have to remember which particular utility class a static method is in. It’s just extra hassle. I’m suggesting we add global functions to Java and optional “namespaces” to group them. Take a look at this utility class:</p><figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span></span><span class="kd">class</span> <span class="nc">TextUtils</span> <span class="o">{</span>

  <span class="o">}</span>
<span class="o">}</span></code></pre></figure><p>Now look at this global function with a namespace:</p><figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span></span><span class="n">namespace</span> <span class="n">TextUtils</span> <span class="o">{</span>

  <span class="o">}</span>
<span class="o">}</span></code></pre></figure><p>My point is that since we are already using classes as collections of functions, let’s make it more convenient. In some applications we won’t even need namespaces, just global functions, like in C and C++.</p><h2 id="full-access-to-private-attributes-and-methods">Full Access to Private Attributes and Methods</h2><p>In order to access a private attribute or a method of an object from outside we have to use the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/reflect/">Reflection API</a>. It’s not particularly difficult, but it does take a few lines of code, which are not so easy to read and understand:</p><figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span></span><span class="kd">class</span> <span class="nc">Point</span> <span class="o">{</span>

At compile time you simply ignore the warning and move on. If you really care about encapsulation, pay attention to the warning and do something else. But in most cases programmers will ignore it, since they would happily use the Reflection API anyway.</p><h2 id="null-by-default">NULL by Default</h2><p>It would be convenient to let us call constructors and methods with an incomplete set of arguments. The arguments we don’t provide will be set to <code>null</code> by default. Also, when a method has to return something, but there is no <code>return</code> statement, Java should return <code>null</code>. This is almost exactly how it works in PHP, Ruby, and many other languages. I believe it would be a convenient feature for Java <del>monkeys</del> developers too.</p><p>We won’t need to define so many methods when some of the arguments are optional. <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/methods.html">Method overloading</a> is very verbose and difficult to understand. Instead, we should have one method with a long list of arguments. Some of them will be provided by the caller, others will be set to <code>null</code>. The method will decide what to do, for example:</p><figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span></span><span class="kt">void</span> <span class="nf">save</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">File</span> <span class="n">file</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">String</span> <span class="n">encoding</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">{</span>

   <span class="n">encoding</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">&quot;UTF-8&quot;</span><span class="o">;</span>
 <span class="o">}</span>
<span class="o">}</span></code></pre></figure><p>Then we just call either <code>save(f)</code> or <code>save(f, "UTF-16")</code>. The method will understand what we mean. We can also make it even more convenient, like it’s done in Ruby, providing method arguments by names:</p><figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span></span><span class="n">save</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">file</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">f</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">encoding</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="s">&quot;UTF-16&quot;</span><span class="o">);</span></code></pre></figure><p>Also, when there is nothing to return, the method must return <code>null</code> by default. Writing <code>return null</code> is just a waste of a code line and doesn’t really improve readability. Take a look:</p><figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span></span><span class="n">String</span> <span class="nf">load</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">File</span> <span class="n">file</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">{</span>

 <span class="o">}</span>
<span class="o">}</span></code></pre></figure><p>It’s obvious from this code that if the file exists, the method loads and returns its content. If not, it returns <code>null</code>, which will be a good indicator for the caller that something is not right and the content of the file is not available.</p><h2 id="getters-and-setters">Getters and Setters</h2><p>I think it’s only obvious that we need this feature: every private attribute must automatically have <a href="/2014/09/16/getters-and-setters-are-evil.html">a setter and a getter</a>. There should be no need to create them, Java will provide them out-of-the-box, just like <a href="https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/properties.html">Kotlin</a> and <a href="http://www.rubyist.net/~slagell/ruby/accessors.html">Ruby</a> do.

The world doesn’t need managers anymore, it needs leaders. And you must be one. PMBOK and RUP on your bookshelf must be replaced with Elon Musk and Peter Thiel biographies.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be a Committer&lt;/strong&gt;. Not a &lt;a href=&quot;https://git-scm.com/&quot;&gt;Git&lt;/a&gt; committer, obviously—that’s for junior programmers. You have to commit yourself to the project, just like Tim Cook &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2016/12/19/apples-tim-cook-assures-employees-that-it-is-committed-to-the-mac-and-that-great-desktops-are-coming/&quot;&gt;committed&lt;/a&gt; to MacBooks. Technically, this means: staying in the office till late, taking no vacations, wearing a branded t-shirt, never discussing a salary or any money at all, and being a proud patriot, no matter how ugly the product is. In other words, being a &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/10/06/how-to-be-good-office-slave.html&quot;&gt;good slave&lt;/a&gt; and showing your team a good example. Don’t worry about the future, when projects fail good committers just commit &lt;del&gt;suicide&lt;/del&gt; themselves to new projects.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be a Friend&lt;/strong&gt;. Explicit and non-ambiguous work orders are not popular any more—they create tension and destroy &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/03/02/team-morale-myths-and-reality.html&quot;&gt;team morale&lt;/a&gt;. Guilt-driven management is much more subtle and elegant: you turn your subordinates into a family and then say: “I count on you as a friend.” Who can refuse a friend? And not even a friend, but a mom. This is who they will associate you with when the guilt kicks in—with their mothers. They won’t disobey, won’t quit, and will never ask for &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/12/06/how-to-pay-programmers-less.html&quot;&gt;more money&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Don't worry about the future, when projects fail good committers just commit themselves to new projects.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be Responsible&lt;/strong&gt;. In the brick-and-mortar management era responsibility was &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/09/24/why-monetary-awards-dont-work.html&quot;&gt;measurable&lt;/a&gt; by what you earn if you succeed and how you suffer if you fail. Luckily, the world has recently learned that this was a mistake we’d been making for &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/09/27/command-control-innovate.html&quot;&gt;a hundreds years&lt;/a&gt;. We don’t suffer any more. Being responsible now means something completely different.

Not a &lt;a href=&quot;https://git-scm.com/&quot;&gt;Git&lt;/a&gt; committer, obviously—that’s for junior programmers. You have to commit yourself to the project, just like Tim Cook &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2016/12/19/apples-tim-cook-assures-employees-that-it-is-committed-to-the-mac-and-that-great-desktops-are-coming/&quot;&gt;committed&lt;/a&gt; to MacBooks. Technically, this means: staying in the office till late, taking no vacations, wearing a branded t-shirt, never discussing a salary or any money at all, and being a proud patriot, no matter how ugly the product is. In other words, being a &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/10/06/how-to-be-good-office-slave.html&quot;&gt;good slave&lt;/a&gt; and showing your team a good example.

Guilt-driven management is much more subtle and elegant: you turn your subordinates into a family and then say: “I count on you as a friend.” Who can refuse a friend? And not even a friend, but a mom. This is who they will associate you with when the guilt kicks in—with their mothers. They won’t disobey, won’t quit, and will never ask for &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/12/06/how-to-pay-programmers-less.html&quot;&gt;more money&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Don't worry about the future, when projects fail good committers just commit themselves to new projects.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be Responsible&lt;/strong&gt;. In the brick-and-mortar management era responsibility was &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/09/24/why-monetary-awards-dont-work.html&quot;&gt;measurable&lt;/a&gt; by what you earn if you succeed and how you suffer if you fail. Luckily, the world has recently learned that this was a mistake we’d been making for &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/09/27/command-control-innovate.html&quot;&gt;a hundreds years&lt;/a&gt;. We don’t suffer any more. Being responsible now means something completely different. We wear stickers on our MacBooks, we fall in love with “extremely talented people,” we participate, engage, celebrate, and champion excellence. And, of course, now it is &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/11/21/ringelmann-effect-vs-agile.html&quot;&gt;always&lt;/a&gt; “We” instead of “I”: “We are responsible,” “It is our project,” “We can,” “Our goal is to do it together!” Of course, when the project fails you find a new one, with a &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/07/21/hourly-pay-modern-slavery.html&quot;&gt;bigger salary&lt;/a&gt; and a new group of extremely talented people, and become very responsible again.

You must remember that keeping people happy is more important than their results, effectiveness and productivity. As an organic manager you must never offend your team with any negativity, finger-pointing, or <a href="/2015/01/05/how-to-be-honest-and-keep-customer.html">honesty</a>. You must think positively and always find a balance somewhere between “you guys are good” and “you’re just fantastic.” You must be their full-hearted <del>clown</del> cheerleader!

How many <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/why-people-are-using-the-term-latinx_us_57753328e4b0cc0fa136a159">latinx</a> are in your team? What about gays and transsexuals? You’re not sure? That’s wrong. You have to count. You don’t know how to segregate bi-sexuals from “normal” people and black females from white males? Well, do the research, there must be some “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mischling_Test">mischling tests</a>” you could do. You have to learn how to count and pay attention to the numbers. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/28/uber-first-diversity-report/">Uber</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/01/krablr-releases-first-diversity-report/">others</a> already do. Diversity, equality, and tolerance: these metrics are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKcWu0tsiZM">quickly replacing</a> outdated performance and productivity appraisals.</p><p><strong>Be Reward-Focused</strong>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leon_Trotsky">Trotsky</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Revolution_Betrayed">said</a> in 1937 that people would eventually work not out of greed or poverty, but because they just enjoy it. He would be happy to see that his prophesy finally <a href="https://techbeacon.com/13-ways-motivate-software-engineers">came true</a>: programmers don’t work for money any more. They <a href="https://www.verywell.com/what-is-intrinsic-motivation-2795385">work</a> for challenge, respect, curiosity, recognition, cooperation, and free beer on Fridays. As a modern eco-manager you must stop humiliating them with old-fashioned <a href="/2014/09/24/why-monetary-awards-dont-work.html">dollar bills</a> and start inspiring them with these <a href="/2015/03/02/team-morale-myths-and-reality.html">intrinsic rewards</a> and free cookies. You will <a href="/2016/12/06/how-to-pay-programmers-less.html">save some money</a> too.</p><p><strong>Be Equal</strong>. <a href="/2016/02/18/holacracy-autocracy.html">Holacracy</a> is quickly replacing military-style management hierarchies, which proved to be depressing and hurtful to human feelings. Modern managers don’t even like to be called “managers.” Instead, they <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/joshlinkner/2014/12/04/the-21-most-creative-job-titles/#2b863a112933">demand</a> we call them ambassadors, curators, cheerleaders, and catalysts. You must be very creative in hiding your actual career ladder position, in order not to irritate and hurt your team. Of course, you will still use fear and guilt to keep your <a href="/2015/10/06/how-to-be-good-office-slave.html">slaves</a> under control, but new eco-titles will help you keep them less aware of what’s going on.</p><aside class="quote">You still use fear and guilt to keep your slaves under control, but new eco-titles help you keep them less aware of what's going on.</aside><p><strong>Be a Leader</strong>. Traditional <a href="/2016/05/24/who-is-project-manager.html">project management</a> with its critical path method, contingency reserves, cause-and-effect diagrams, work breakdown structures, policies, procedures, and plans, is dead. <a href="/2016/07/11/mistakes-in-agile-manifesto.html">Agile</a>, Scrum, Kanban, and others, are dancing on its grave, with motivational speeches, burndown rates, sprints, <a href="/2015/01/08/morning-standup-meetings.html">standups</a>, and smoothies. The world doesn’t need managers anymore, it needs leaders. And you must be one. PMBOK and RUP on your bookshelf must be replaced with Elon Musk and Peter Thiel biographies.</p><p><strong>Be a Committer</strong>. Not a <a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a> committer, obviously—that’s for junior programmers. You have to commit yourself to the project, just like Tim Cook <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/12/19/apples-tim-cook-assures-employees-that-it-is-committed-to-the-mac-and-that-great-desktops-are-coming/">committed</a> to MacBooks. Technically, this means: staying in the office till late, taking no vacations, wearing a branded t-shirt, never discussing a salary or any money at all, and being a proud patriot, no matter how ugly the product is. In other words, being a <a href="/2015/10/06/how-to-be-good-office-slave.html">good slave</a> and showing your team a good example. Don’t worry about the future, when projects fail good committers just commit <del>suicide</del> themselves to new projects.</p><p><strong>Be a Friend</strong>. Explicit and non-ambiguous work orders are not popular any more—they create tension and destroy <a href="/2015/03/02/team-morale-myths-and-reality.html">team morale</a>. Guilt-driven management is much more subtle and elegant: you turn your subordinates into a family and then say: “I count on you as a friend.” Who can refuse a friend? And not even a friend, but a mom. This is who they will associate you with when the guilt kicks in—with their mothers. They won’t disobey, won’t quit, and will never ask for <a href="/2016/12/06/how-to-pay-programmers-less.html">more money</a>.</p><aside class="quote">Don't worry about the future, when projects fail good committers just commit themselves to new projects.</aside><p><strong>Be Responsible</strong>.

However, in most cases, the replacement of a brick-and-mortar office with a virtual one doesn’t help companies and their &lt;del&gt;slaves&lt;/del&gt; employees become more productive.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;!--more--&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;jb_picture&quot;&gt;&lt;img itemprop=&quot;image&quot; alt=&quot;Happiness (1998) by Todd Solondz&quot; src=&quot;/images/2017/05/happiness.jpg&quot; longdesc=&quot;#3770a056&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption id=&quot;3770a056&quot;&gt;Happiness (1998) by Todd Solondz&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Working from home, also known as working from anywhere, working remotely, or simply telecommuting, usually leads to four radical changes:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;First, we replace office security cameras on the ceiling with screen &lt;strong&gt;monitoring&lt;/strong&gt; software and/or web cameras that constantly watch us. &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.upwork.com/hc/en-us/articles/211064098-Log-Time-with-the-Upwork-Desktop-App-&quot;&gt;Upwork does&lt;/a&gt; it to its thousands of &lt;del&gt;monkeys&lt;/del&gt; freelancers, requiring them to install a background screen capture utility and make sure it is running during their entire working time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Second, we replace meeting rooms with conference software like &lt;a href=&quot;https://zoom.us/&quot;&gt;Zoom&lt;/a&gt; or good old &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.skype.com/en/&quot;&gt;Skype&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://hbr.org/2015/03/how-to-run-a-great-virtual-meeting&quot;&gt;learn&lt;/a&gt; how to make &lt;strong&gt;virtual meetings&lt;/strong&gt; productive. The main principle is similar to the one we use for traditional meetings: Make it fun. Otherwise we will switch to Facebook or PokerStars while the manager is still &lt;del&gt;acting&lt;/del&gt; talking in her window.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Third, we replace Post-it stickies and Scrum boards with tickets and tasks in &lt;a href=&quot;https://trello.com/&quot;&gt;Trello&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-best-alternatives-to-Trello&quot;&gt;any other&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;task tracker&lt;/strong&gt;. We keep everybody busy learning new tools and filling them with data.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Fourth, and most importantly, we replace office chit-chats with &lt;a href=&quot;https://slack.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Slack&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; channels or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hipchat.com/&quot;&gt;HipChat&lt;/a&gt; groups. Instead of being in the office at 9 a.m., everybody will have the ability to demonstrate the level of their &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presenteeism&quot;&gt;presenteeism&lt;/a&gt; using emojis.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Your life, as a developer, will be very different on a team that works remotely. It will be full of real freedom. However, there will be certain problems:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s Harder to Prove Innocence&lt;/strong&gt;. How does your &lt;a href=&quot;/2017/06/06/gluten-free-management.html&quot;&gt;manager&lt;/a&gt; know you’re actually working, not watching TV, playing with your kids, or grooming your favorite open source pets? In the office, it’s easier; you just sit in front of the monitor and the boss is happy. At home or in a coffee shop, you are guilty by default until you prove the opposite by creating new tickets, posting emojis to Slack, and sending emails with multiple CCs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s Harder to Find Information&lt;/strong&gt;. In the office, you can always ask your question out loud for the most knowledgeable person to help you. Remotely, however, you will have to search Wiki pages, Google Docs, and, god forbid, Git logs. Be prepared for almost nobody to be interested in sharing knowledge or teaching you remotely—what is the point if nobody sees him doing it? You will be on your own in front of that year-old documentation made by someone fired right after writing it up.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s Harder to Avoid Overtime&lt;/strong&gt;. In the office, you just walk away with everybody else when time is up. Remotely, you will have phone calls and Slack discussions in the middle of the night on Sunday, especially if the team is distributed across multiple time zones. Everybody will expect 24-7 availability because you’re working from home. And changing the status to “Do not disturb” in Skype will only offend them and seriously damage your reputation. In a work-from-home environment, good programmers are those who are always online.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s Harder to Defend Yourself&lt;/strong&gt;. You won’t know where to expect the next bout of trouble from. In the office, you can visually observe the territory, smell conflict in the air, see how people move, what they talk about, and who is the next victim. Remotely, you’re sitting in isolation, extracting pieces of information from Slack. You can easily become the next victim without even noticing it. Simply put, they will stab you in the back while you’re writing Java and thinking about a new unit test.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s Harder Not to Waste Time&lt;/strong&gt;. It sounds counter-intuitive, but while sitting at home, you waste much more time than in the office. Meetings will be called more frequently, and they will be less effective, thanks to constant issues with scheduling, quality of connection, software failure, and of course a lack of online communication skills. The manager will call more meetings largely in order to convince himself that the team is actually working; hearing your voice many times a day is a perfect confirmation that you are busy and he is a good manager.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Remote work will happen automatically as soon as everybody starts getting their paychecks for the results they deliver, not the time they spend.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;On a more serious note, I believe that working remotely only makes things &lt;em&gt;worse&lt;/em&gt; when the motivation of the team is still based on &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/07/21/hourly-pay-modern-slavery.html&quot;&gt;hourly pay&lt;/a&gt;. A slave working remotely is still a slave. Moreover, this slave is harder to manage and control. First, we have to switch to a results-based payment model and then go remote.

However, in most cases, the replacement of a brick-and-mortar office with a virtual one doesn’t help companies and their &lt;del&gt;slaves&lt;/del&gt; employees become more productive.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;!--more--&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;jb_picture&quot;&gt;&lt;img itemprop=&quot;image&quot; alt=&quot;Happiness (1998) by Todd Solondz&quot; src=&quot;/images/2017/05/happiness.jpg&quot; longdesc=&quot;#3770a056&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption id=&quot;3770a056&quot;&gt;Happiness (1998) by Todd Solondz&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Working from home, also known as working from anywhere, working remotely, or simply telecommuting, usually leads to four radical changes:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;First, we replace office security cameras on the ceiling with screen &lt;strong&gt;monitoring&lt;/strong&gt; software and/or web cameras that constantly watch us. &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.upwork.com/hc/en-us/articles/211064098-Log-Time-with-the-Upwork-Desktop-App-&quot;&gt;Upwork does&lt;/a&gt; it to its thousands of &lt;del&gt;monkeys&lt;/del&gt; freelancers, requiring them to install a background screen capture utility and make sure it is running during their entire working time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Second, we replace meeting rooms with conference software like &lt;a href=&quot;https://zoom.us/&quot;&gt;Zoom&lt;/a&gt; or good old &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.skype.com/en/&quot;&gt;Skype&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://hbr.org/2015/03/how-to-run-a-great-virtual-meeting&quot;&gt;learn&lt;/a&gt; how to make &lt;strong&gt;virtual meetings&lt;/strong&gt; productive. The main principle is similar to the one we use for traditional meetings: Make it fun. Otherwise we will switch to Facebook or PokerStars while the manager is still &lt;del&gt;acting&lt;/del&gt; talking in her window.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Third, we replace Post-it stickies and Scrum boards with tickets and tasks in &lt;a href=&quot;https://trello.com/&quot;&gt;Trello&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-best-alternatives-to-Trello&quot;&gt;any other&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;task tracker&lt;/strong&gt;. We keep everybody busy learning new tools and filling them with data.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Fourth, and most importantly, we replace office chit-chats with &lt;a href=&quot;https://slack.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Slack&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; channels or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hipchat.com/&quot;&gt;HipChat&lt;/a&gt; groups. Instead of being in the office at 9 a.m., everybody will have the ability to demonstrate the level of their &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presenteeism&quot;&gt;presenteeism&lt;/a&gt; using emojis.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Your life, as a developer, will be very different on a team that works remotely. It will be full of real freedom. However, there will be certain problems:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s Harder to Prove Innocence&lt;/strong&gt;. How does your &lt;a href=&quot;/2017/06/06/gluten-free-management.html&quot;&gt;manager&lt;/a&gt; know you’re actually working, not watching TV, playing with your kids, or grooming your favorite open source pets? In the office, it’s easier; you just sit in front of the monitor and the boss is happy. At home or in a coffee shop, you are guilty by default until you prove the opposite by creating new tickets, posting emojis to Slack, and sending emails with multiple CCs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s Harder to Find Information&lt;/strong&gt;. In the office, you can always ask your question out loud for the most knowledgeable person to help you. Remotely, however, you will have to search Wiki pages, Google Docs, and, god forbid, Git logs. Be prepared for almost nobody to be interested in sharing knowledge or teaching you remotely—what is the point if nobody sees him doing it? You will be on your own in front of that year-old documentation made by someone fired right after writing it up.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s Harder to Avoid Overtime&lt;/strong&gt;. In the office, you just walk away with everybody else when time is up. Remotely, you will have phone calls and Slack discussions in the middle of the night on Sunday, especially if the team is distributed across multiple time zones. Everybody will expect 24-7 availability because you’re working from home. And changing the status to “Do not disturb” in Skype will only offend them and seriously damage your reputation. In a work-from-home environment, good programmers are those who are always online.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s Harder to Defend Yourself&lt;/strong&gt;. You won’t know where to expect the next bout of trouble from. In the office, you can visually observe the territory, smell conflict in the air, see how people move, what they talk about, and who is the next victim. Remotely, you’re sitting in isolation, extracting pieces of information from Slack. You can easily become the next victim without even noticing it. Simply put, they will stab you in the back while you’re writing Java and thinking about a new unit test.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s Harder Not to Waste Time&lt;/strong&gt;. It sounds counter-intuitive, but while sitting at home, you waste much more time than in the office. Meetings will be called more frequently, and they will be less effective, thanks to constant issues with scheduling, quality of connection, software failure, and of course a lack of online communication skills. The manager will call more meetings largely in order to convince himself that the team is actually working; hearing your voice many times a day is a perfect confirmation that you are busy and he is a good manager.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Remote work will happen automatically as soon as everybody starts getting their paychecks for the results they deliver, not the time they spend.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;On a more serious note, I believe that working remotely only makes things &lt;em&gt;worse&lt;/em&gt; when the motivation of the team is still based on &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/07/21/hourly-pay-modern-slavery.html&quot;&gt;hourly pay&lt;/a&gt;. A slave working remotely is still a slave. Moreover, this slave is harder to manage and control. First, we have to switch to a results-based payment model and then go remote. Actually, remote work will happen automatically as soon as everybody starts getting their paychecks for the results they deliver, not the time they spend. They will simply stop showing up at the office, but their results will keep coming to the project, without any web cameras or Slack channels.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s no surprise that many big companies have already decided to stop this telecommuting nonsense and put their slaves back behind closed doors; take &lt;a

They will simply stop showing up at the office, but their results will keep coming to the project, without any web cameras or Slack channels.</p><p>It’s no surprise that many big companies have already decided to stop this telecommuting nonsense and put their slaves back behind closed doors; take <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2014/02/19/Leaving-Google">Google</a>, <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2013/02/25/technology/yahoo-work-from-home/index.html?iid=EL">Yahoo</a>, and <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2013/03/05/technology/best-buy-work-from-home/index.html">Best Buy</a> for example.</p></p><nav class="buttons notranslate desktop-only"> <a href="http://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://www.yegor256.com/2017/05/02/remote-slaves.html" title="Share on Facebook" class="button" rel="nofollow"> <span class="count count-facebook">0</span> <i class="icon icon-facebook notranslate" aria-hidden="true"></i> </a> <a href="https://twitter.com/share?url=https://www.yegor256.com/2017/05/02/remote-slaves.html&amp;text=A+Remote+Slave+Is+Still+a+Slave" title="Share on Twitter" class="button" rel="nofollow"> <span class="count count-twitter">0</span> <i class="icon icon-twitter notranslate" aria-hidden="true"></i> </a> <a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=https://www.yegor256.com/2017/05/02/remote-slaves.html" title="Share on Google+" class="button" rel="nofollow"> <span class="count count-googleplus">0</span> <i class="icon icon-googleplus notranslate" aria-hidden="true"></i> </a> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/cws/share?url=https://www.yegor256.com/2017/05/02/remote-slaves.html" title="Share on LinkedIn" class="button" rel="nofollow"> <span class="count count-linkedin">0</span> <i class="icon icon-linkedin notranslate" aria-hidden="true"></i> </a> <a href="http://reddit.com/submit?url=https://www.yegor256.com/2017/05/02/remote-slaves.html%3F2017-18&amp;title=A+Remote+Slave+Is+Still+a+Slave" title="Share on Reddit" class="button" rel="nofollow"> <span class="count count-reddit">0</span> <i class="icon icon-reddit notranslate" aria-hidden="true"></i> </a> <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/submitlink?u=https://www.yegor256.com/2017/05/02/remote-slaves.html%3F2017-18&amp;t=A+Remote+Slave+Is+Still+a+Slave" title="Share on Hacker News" class="button" rel="nofollow"> <span class="count count-hackernews">0</span> <i class="icon icon-hackernews notranslate" aria-hidden="true"></i> </a> </nav> </header> <article class="main" itemprop="articleBody"><div ><p>Working remotely is definitely a trend, according to the <a href="https://www.bls.gov/opub/ted/2016/24-percent-of-employed-people-did-some-or-all-of-their-work-at-home-in-2015.htm">BLS</a> and my personal observations. “Let them work from home” seems to be the silver bullet for every second startup and even some big companies like <a href="https://open.bufferapp.com/remote-team-connect/">Buffer</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/billion-dollar-tech-company-offices-email-glenn-leibowitz">Automattic</a>, <a href="https://www.groovehq.com/blog/remote-work-tips">Groove</a>, and <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/laurashin/2017/01/31/work-from-home-in-2017-the-top-100-companies-offering-remote-jobs/">many others</a>.

The main principle is similar to the one we use for traditional meetings: Make it fun. Otherwise we will switch to Facebook or PokerStars while the manager is still <del>acting</del> talking in her window.</p></li> <li><p>Third, we replace Post-it stickies and Scrum boards with tickets and tasks in <a href="https://trello.com/">Trello</a> or <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-best-alternatives-to-Trello">any other</a> <strong>task tracker</strong>. We keep everybody busy learning new tools and filling them with data.</p></li> <li><p>Fourth, and most importantly, we replace office chit-chats with <a href="https://slack.com/"><strong>Slack</strong></a> channels or <a href="https://www.hipchat.com/">HipChat</a> groups. Instead of being in the office at 9 a.m., everybody will have the ability to demonstrate the level of their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presenteeism">presenteeism</a> using emojis.</p></li></ul><p>Your life, as a developer, will be very different on a team that works remotely. It will be full of real freedom. However, there will be certain problems:</p><p><strong>It’s Harder to Prove Innocence</strong>. How does your <a href="/2017/06/06/gluten-free-management.html">manager</a> know you’re actually working, not watching TV, playing with your kids, or grooming your favorite open source pets? In the office, it’s easier; you just sit in front of the monitor and the boss is happy. At home or in a coffee shop, you are guilty by default until you prove the opposite by creating new tickets, posting emojis to Slack, and sending emails with multiple CCs.</p><p><strong>It’s Harder to Find Information</strong>. In the office, you can always ask your question out loud for the most knowledgeable person to help you. Remotely, however, you will have to search Wiki pages, Google Docs, and, god forbid, Git logs. Be prepared for almost nobody to be interested in sharing knowledge or teaching you remotely—what is the point if nobody sees him doing it? You will be on your own in front of that year-old documentation made by someone fired right after writing it up.</p><p><strong>It’s Harder to Avoid Overtime</strong>. In the office, you just walk away with everybody else when time is up. Remotely, you will have phone calls and Slack discussions in the middle of the night on Sunday, especially if the team is distributed across multiple time zones. Everybody will expect 24-7 availability because you’re working from home. And changing the status to “Do not disturb” in Skype will only offend them and seriously damage your reputation. In a work-from-home environment, good programmers are those who are always online.</p><p><strong>It’s Harder to Defend Yourself</strong>. You won’t know where to expect the next bout of trouble from. In the office, you can visually observe the territory, smell conflict in the air, see how people move, what they talk about, and who is the next victim. Remotely, you’re sitting in isolation, extracting pieces of information from Slack. You can easily become the next victim without even noticing it. Simply put, they will stab you in the back while you’re writing Java and thinking about a new unit test.</p><p><strong>It’s Harder Not to Waste Time</strong>. It sounds counter-intuitive, but while sitting at home, you waste much more time than in the office. Meetings will be called more frequently, and they will be less effective, thanks to constant issues with scheduling, quality of connection, software failure, and of course a lack of online communication skills. The manager will call more meetings largely in order to convince himself that the team is actually working; hearing your voice many times a day is a perfect confirmation that you are busy and he is a good manager.</p><aside class="quote">Remote work will happen automatically as soon as everybody starts getting their paychecks for the results they deliver, not the time they spend.</aside><p>On a more serious note, I believe that working remotely only makes things <em>worse</em> when the motivation of the team is still based on <a href="/2015/07/21/hourly-pay-modern-slavery.html">hourly pay</a>. A slave working remotely is still a slave. Moreover, this slave is harder to manage and control. First, we have to switch to a results-based payment model and then go remote.

Let me share.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;!--more--&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;jb_picture&quot;&gt;&lt;img itemprop=&quot;image&quot; alt=&quot;Ben-Hur (1959) by William Wyler&quot; src=&quot;/images/2016/12/ben-hur.jpg&quot; longdesc=&quot;#cdad7b09&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption id=&quot;cdad7b09&quot;&gt;Ben-Hur (1959) by William Wyler&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keep salaries secret&lt;/strong&gt;. It’s obvious: Don’t let them discuss &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/07/21/hourly-pay-modern-slavery.html&quot;&gt;salaries&lt;/a&gt;. They must keep this information secret. Warn them or even sign &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/05/04/how-to-protect-business-idea.html&quot;&gt;NDAs&lt;/a&gt; prohibiting any talks about wages, bonuses, compensation plans, etc. They must feel that this information is toxic and never even talk to each other about salaries. If they don’t know how much their coworkers are getting, they won’t raise salary questions for much longer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Give raises randomly&lt;/strong&gt;. There should be no system behind your salary upgrades or &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/09/16/how-to-fire-someone-right.html&quot;&gt;firing decisions&lt;/a&gt;. You give them raises when you feel like it, not when they are being more productive or effective. Try to make your decisions unpredictable. Unpredictability creates fear, and this is exactly what you need. They will be afraid of you and will not complain about being underpaid for a long time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No conferences&lt;/strong&gt;. Don’t allow them to attend meetups or conferences. They may meet &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/09/29/mayonnaise.html&quot;&gt;recruiters&lt;/a&gt; there and find out that their salaries are not &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/10/29/how-much-do-you-cost.html&quot;&gt;fair enough&lt;/a&gt;. Promote the idea that conferences are just a waste of time. It’s better to organize events in the &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/08/05/distributed-teams-are-higher-quality.html&quot;&gt;office&lt;/a&gt;. They always have to stay together, never free to meet programmers from other companies. The less they know, the safer you are.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No work from home&lt;/strong&gt;. The office must be their second home. Well, preferably the first one. They must go there every day, have a desk there, a computer, a chair, and a stapler. They will be emotionally attached to the place and it will be very difficult to leave, no matter how underpaid they will be. Never allow them to work &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/08/05/distributed-teams-are-higher-quality.html&quot;&gt;remotely&lt;/a&gt;—they may start thinking about a new home with a bigger salary.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spy on them&lt;/strong&gt;. Make sure they all use your email server, computers, servers, and even mobile phones. Install software that tracks all their messages. Ideally, you should have a security department watching all of them and regularly informing you about abnormal or suspicious behavior (office cameras will help too). Any contact with other companies should be considered suspicious. Employees must know you’re spying on them. Extra fear is always helpful.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Brainwash them regularly by communicating how great your company is.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make a deal with competitors&lt;/strong&gt;. Contact your major competitors in the region and agree to not head-hunt their programmers if they don’t touch yours. If they reject this deal, try to recruit a few of their key engineers. Just offer to double their salaries. You won’t really hire them, of course, but this move will definitely shake your local market, and competitors will be afraid of you. They will agree to never touch your &lt;del&gt;slaves&lt;/del&gt; developers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Promote corporate values&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/03/02/team-morale-myths-and-reality.html&quot;&gt;Brainwash&lt;/a&gt; them regularly by communicating how great your company is, how big its mission is, and how important their contribution is. The numbers on their paychecks will look way less important compared to the multi-billion-dollar market the team is trying to dominate. They will sacrifice for a while. For quite a long time, this trick will work.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Build a family&lt;/strong&gt;. Corporate parties, Friday beer, team building events, bowling, birthdays, lunches and team nights—use these &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/03/02/team-morale-myths-and-reality.html&quot;&gt;tools&lt;/a&gt; to create a feeling that your company is their family. Money is not really what good people talk about in a family, right? Asking for a raise will sound like a betrayal of family values—they will be afraid to do that.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stress them&lt;/strong&gt;. They must not feel relaxed, it’s not in your favor. Make sure they have tight deadlines, complex problems to solve, and enough guilt on their shoulders. They won’t ask for a raise, constantly feeling guilty for letting you down with project goals. Try to make them responsible for failures as much as possible.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make promises&lt;/strong&gt;. You don’t need to keep them, but you have to make them: promise to raise their salaries soon, or by the time you raise investments, or by the time a big contract is signed, or when “the time is right.” It is important to always make your promises dependable on events that are out of your control—your hands must always be clean.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Instead of giving someone a raise, it's always better to buy a new PlayStation for the office.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Buy them cushion chairs and tennis tables&lt;/strong&gt;. Spend just a little on all those funny office things, and they will pay you back big time, through the ability to underpay your programmers. A fancy and professional coffee machine will cost you $1,000 and make it possible to save $200 to $300 on each programmer monthly. Do the math. Make yourself a rule that instead of giving someone a raise, it’s always better to buy a new PlayStation for the office. Also, let them bring their &lt;del&gt;spouses&lt;/del&gt; pets to the office—they will &lt;del&gt;work&lt;/del&gt; stay longer for less money.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Give them sound titles&lt;/strong&gt;. Call them Vice Presidents, for example VP of Engineering, VP of Technology, VP of Whatever. Not a big deal for you, but very important for them. The salary will be much less valuable than the title they can put on their LinkedIn profiles. If you’re running out of Vice Presidents, try &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/10/12/who-is-software-architect.html&quot;&gt;Senior Architect&lt;/a&gt;, Lead Technical Lead, Chief Scientist, etc.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;They will keep working for you for less money just because you're good friends.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Help them survive&lt;/strong&gt;. Most programmers are rather stupid when it comes to managing money. They simply don’t know how to buy insurance, how to plan a retirement fund, or even how to pay taxes. You help them, to your own benefit, of course. They will be happy to feel safe in your hands, and won’t leave you. They won’t ask for a raise, either, because they will feel bad about even starting such a negotiation. You must be the “parent,” and they will be the “kids.” It’s a good old model. It works.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be a friend&lt;/strong&gt;. This is the last and most powerful technique. You have to be a friend to your programmers. It’s very difficult to negotiate money with a friend—they won’t be able to do it easily. They will keep working for you for less money just because you’re good friends. How do you become friends? Well, meet their families, invite them over for dinner at your house, give them birthday gifts—all those tricks. They will save you a lot of money.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Did I forget anything?&lt;/p&gt; " /> <meta name="keywords" content="next, path, output, content, previous, url, relative_path, id, collection, excerpt, draft, categories, layout, title, date, tags, place, description, keywords, social, translated, related, image, jb_picture, slug, ext" /> <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1"/> <meta name="google-site-verification" content="JEj_gQr2CPe2QKGw8XdMz0R7VboQIUbX3FlM-lwTq-8" /> <meta name="author" content="Yegor Bugayenko"> <meta name="article:published_time" content="2016-12-06 00:00:00 +0000"> <meta name="og:site_name" content="Yegor Bugayenko"/> <meta name="og:type" content="article" /> <meta name="og:locale" content="en_US" /> <meta name="twitter:account_id" content="4503599630178231" /> <meta name="twitter:creator" content="@yegor256"/> <meta name="twitter:site" content="@yegor256"/> <meta name="twitter:title" property="og:title" content="How to Pay Programmers Less"/> <meta name="twitter:description" property="og:description" content="&lt;p&gt;To create software, you need programmers.

Extra fear is always helpful.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Brainwash them regularly by communicating how great your company is.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make a deal with competitors&lt;/strong&gt;. Contact your major competitors in the region and agree to not head-hunt their programmers if they don’t touch yours. If they reject this deal, try to recruit a few of their key engineers. Just offer to double their salaries. You won’t really hire them, of course, but this move will definitely shake your local market, and competitors will be afraid of you. They will agree to never touch your &lt;del&gt;slaves&lt;/del&gt; developers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Promote corporate values&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/03/02/team-morale-myths-and-reality.html&quot;&gt;Brainwash&lt;/a&gt; them regularly by communicating how great your company is, how big its mission is, and how important their contribution is. The numbers on their paychecks will look way less important compared to the multi-billion-dollar market the team is trying to dominate. They will sacrifice for a while. For quite a long time, this trick will work.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Build a family&lt;/strong&gt;. Corporate parties, Friday beer, team building events, bowling, birthdays, lunches and team nights—use these &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/03/02/team-morale-myths-and-reality.html&quot;&gt;tools&lt;/a&gt; to create a feeling that your company is their family. Money is not really what good people talk about in a family, right? Asking for a raise will sound like a betrayal of family values—they will be afraid to do that.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stress them&lt;/strong&gt;. They must not feel relaxed, it’s not in your favor. Make sure they have tight deadlines, complex problems to solve, and enough guilt on their shoulders. They won’t ask for a raise, constantly feeling guilty for letting you down with project goals. Try to make them responsible for failures as much as possible.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make promises&lt;/strong&gt;. You don’t need to keep them, but you have to make them: promise to raise their salaries soon, or by the time you raise investments, or by the time a big contract is signed, or when “the time is right.” It is important to always make your promises dependable on events that are out of your control—your hands must always be clean.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Instead of giving someone a raise, it's always better to buy a new PlayStation for the office.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Buy them cushion chairs and tennis tables&lt;/strong&gt;. Spend just a little on all those funny office things, and they will pay you back big time, through the ability to underpay your programmers. A fancy and professional coffee machine will cost you $1,000 and make it possible to save $200 to $300 on each programmer monthly. Do the math. Make yourself a rule that instead of giving someone a raise, it’s always better to buy a new PlayStation for the office. Also, let them bring their &lt;del&gt;spouses&lt;/del&gt; pets to the office—they will &lt;del&gt;work&lt;/del&gt; stay longer for less money.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Give them sound titles&lt;/strong&gt;. Call them Vice Presidents, for example VP of Engineering, VP of Technology, VP of Whatever. Not a big deal for you, but very important for them. The salary will be much less valuable than the title they can put on their LinkedIn profiles. If you’re running out of Vice Presidents, try &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/10/12/who-is-software-architect.html&quot;&gt;Senior Architect&lt;/a&gt;, Lead Technical Lead, Chief Scientist, etc.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;They will keep working for you for less money just because you're good friends.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Help them survive&lt;/strong&gt;. Most programmers are rather stupid when it comes to managing money. They simply don’t know how to buy insurance, how to plan a retirement fund, or even how to pay taxes. You help them, to your own benefit, of course. They will be happy to feel safe in your hands, and won’t leave you. They won’t ask for a raise, either, because they will feel bad about even starting such a negotiation. You must be the “parent,” and they will be the “kids.” It’s a good old model. It works.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be a friend&lt;/strong&gt;. This is the last and most powerful technique. You have to be a friend to your programmers. It’s very difficult to negotiate money with a friend—they won’t be able to do it easily. They will keep working for you for less money just because you’re good friends. How do you become friends? Well, meet their families, invite them over for dinner at your house, give them birthday gifts—all those tricks. They will save you a lot of money.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Did I forget anything?&lt;/p&gt; "/> <meta name="twitter:url" property="og:url"

Extra fear is always helpful.</p><aside class="quote">Brainwash them regularly by communicating how great your company is.</aside><p><strong>Make a deal with competitors</strong>. Contact your major competitors in the region and agree to not head-hunt their programmers if they don’t touch yours. If they reject this deal, try to recruit a few of their key engineers. Just offer to double their salaries. You won’t really hire them, of course, but this move will definitely shake your local market, and competitors will be afraid of you. They will agree to never touch your <del>slaves</del> developers.</p><p><strong>Promote corporate values</strong>. <a href="/2015/03/02/team-morale-myths-and-reality.html">Brainwash</a> them regularly by communicating how great your company is, how big its mission is, and how important their contribution is. The numbers on their paychecks will look way less important compared to the multi-billion-dollar market the team is trying to dominate. They will sacrifice for a while. For quite a long time, this trick will work.</p><p><strong>Build a family</strong>. Corporate parties, Friday beer, team building events, bowling, birthdays, lunches and team nights—use these <a href="/2015/03/02/team-morale-myths-and-reality.html">tools</a> to create a feeling that your company is their family. Money is not really what good people talk about in a family, right? Asking for a raise will sound like a betrayal of family values—they will be afraid to do that.</p><p><strong>Stress them</strong>. They must not feel relaxed, it’s not in your favor. Make sure they have tight deadlines, complex problems to solve, and enough guilt on their shoulders. They won’t ask for a raise, constantly feeling guilty for letting you down with project goals. Try to make them responsible for failures as much as possible.</p><p><strong>Make promises</strong>. You don’t need to keep them, but you have to make them: promise to raise their salaries soon, or by the time you raise investments, or by the time a big contract is signed, or when “the time is right.” It is important to always make your promises dependable on events that are out of your control—your hands must always be clean.</p><aside class="quote">Instead of giving someone a raise, it's always better to buy a new PlayStation for the office.</aside><p><strong>Buy them cushion chairs and tennis tables</strong>. Spend just a little on all those funny office things, and they will pay you back big time, through the ability to underpay your programmers. A fancy and professional coffee machine will cost you $1,000 and make it possible to save $200 to $300 on each programmer monthly. Do the math. Make yourself a rule that instead of giving someone a raise, it’s always better to buy a new PlayStation for the office. Also, let them bring their <del>spouses</del> pets to the office—they will <del>work</del> stay longer for less money.</p><p><strong>Give them sound titles</strong>. Call them Vice Presidents, for example VP of Engineering, VP of Technology, VP of Whatever. Not a big deal for you, but very important for them. The salary will be much less valuable than the title they can put on their LinkedIn profiles. If you’re running out of Vice Presidents, try <a href="/2014/10/12/who-is-software-architect.html">Senior Architect</a>, Lead Technical Lead, Chief Scientist, etc.</p><aside class="quote">They will keep working for you for less money just because you're good friends.</aside><p><strong>Help them survive</strong>. Most programmers are rather stupid when it comes to managing money. They simply don’t know how to buy insurance, how to plan a retirement fund, or even how to pay taxes. You help them, to your own benefit, of course. They will be happy to feel safe in your hands, and won’t leave you. They won’t ask for a raise, either, because they will feel bad about even starting such a negotiation. You must be the “parent,” and they will be the “kids.” It’s a good old model. It works.</p><p><strong>Be a friend</strong>. This is the last and most powerful technique. You have to be a friend to your programmers. It’s very difficult to negotiate money with a friend—they won’t be able to do it easily. They will keep working for you for less money just because you’re good friends. How do you become friends? Well, meet their families, invite them over for dinner at your house, give them birthday gifts—all those tricks. They will save you a lot of money.</p><p>Did I forget anything?</p></div></article></div><div class="wrapper"><div class="unprintable"> <hr/><p>If you like this article, you will definitely like these <strong>very relevant</strong> posts too:</p><p><a href='/2016/01/05/how-to-punish-employees.html'><strong>How Do You Punish Your Employees?</strong></a> <br/>A sarcastic overview of different types of abusive and manipulative behavior a bad manager may expose to office employees.</p><p><a href='/2015/10/06/how-to-be-good-office-slave.html'><strong>How to Be a Good Office Slave</strong></a> <br/>Office slavery is what most companies practice and what most office workers suffer from, often unconsciously.</p><p><a href='/2015/03/02/team-morale-myths-and-reality.html'><strong>Team Morale: Myths and Reality</strong></a> <br/>Team morale is a key performance driver in any group, especially a software development team; however, there are many myths about it.</p></div></div><div class="disqus" role="complementary"><p class="disqus_hint"> Please, use <a href="https://help.disqus.com/commenting/what-html-tags-are-allowed-within-comments">syntax highlighting</a> in your comments, to make them more readable.</p><div id="disqus_thread" class="disqus-thread"> <a>&nbsp;</a></div><script> var disqus_config = function () { this.page.url = document.location.href.split('?')[0].split('#')[0].replace('https://', 'http://'); this.page.identifier = this.page.url; }; (function() { var d = document, s = d.createElement('script'); s.src = '//yegor256.disqus.com/embed.js'; s.setAttribute('data-timestamp', +new Date()); (d.head || d.body).appendChild(s); })(); </script> <noscript><div><p class="red"> JavaScript is disabled in your browser, that's why you can't see comments under this post.</p></div></noscript></div><div class="wrapper"> <footer class="footer"><p> &copy; <span itemscope="" itemprop="copyrightHolder" itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"> <span itemprop="name">Yegor Bugayenko</span> </span> 2014&ndash;<span itemprop="copyrightYear">2018</span></p></footer></div></section><div class="wrapper unprintable" style="text-align:center;margin-top:2em;"> <a href="http://www.sixnines.io/h/3ba1652f"> <img src="//www.sixnines.io/b/3ba1652f?style=flat" alt="sixnines availability badge"/> </a></div><script src="//code.jquery.com/jquery-1.9.0.min.js"></script> <script src="/js/all.js?7d5b276b9b5"></script> <script>var disqus_shortname = 'yegor256';</script> <script id="dsq-count-scr" src="//yegor256.disqus.com/count.js" async="async"></script> <script> (function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){ (i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o), m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m) })(window,document,'script','//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga'); ga('create', 'UA-1963507-32', 'auto'); ga('send', 'pageview'); </script> <script> Cd=document;Cr="&"+Math.random();Cp="&s=1"; Cd.cookie="b=b";if(Cd.cookie)Cp+="&c=1"; Cp+="&t="+(new Date()).getTimezoneOffset(); if(self!=top)Cp+="&f=1"; </script> <script> if(navigator.javaEnabled())Cp+="&j=1"; </script> <script> if(typeof(screen)!='undefined')Cp+="&w="+screen.width+"&h="+ screen.height+"&d="+(screen.colorDepth?screen.colorDepth:screen.pixelDepth); </script> <script> Cd.write("<img src='//c.hit.ua/hit?i=95870&g=0&x=2"+Cp+Cr+ "&r="+escape(Cd.referrer)+"&u="+escape(window.location.href)+ "' border='0' wi"+"dth='1' he"+"ight='1'/>"); </script> <script type="application/ld+json"> { "@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Person", "name": "Yegor Bugayenko", "url": "https://www.yegor256.com", "sameAs": [ "https://www.facebook.com/yegor256", "https://instagram.com/yegor256", "https://www.linkedin.com/in/yegor256", "https://twitter.com/yegor256", "https://github.com/yegor256", "https://www.pinterest.com/yegor256/" ] } </script> </body> </html> <!DOCTYPE html> <html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/WebSite"> <head> <meta charset="utf-8"/> <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;I get asked this question very often: Where and how do you find and hire a good programmer? Since I’m a programmer and I &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.teamed.io&quot;&gt;manage&lt;/a&gt; software projects, I’m supposed to know the tricks. I do, of course; there are many of them, but the list below succinctly summarizes the most important ones.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;!--more--&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;jb_picture&quot;&gt;&lt;img itemprop=&quot;image&quot; alt=&quot;Don&amp;#39;t Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood (1996) by Paris Barclay&quot; src=&quot;/images/2016/06/dont-be-a-menace-to-south-central-while-drinking-your-juice-in-the-hood.jpg&quot; longdesc=&quot;#b00247d7&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption id=&quot;b00247d7&quot;&gt;Don&amp;#39;t Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood (1996) by Paris Barclay&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;I’ll be referring to “him,” but these recommendations apply equally to both female and male &lt;del&gt;slaves&lt;/del&gt; software developers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ask a Friend&lt;/strong&gt;. The best way to find talent is through a reference. Who knows the software market better than your high school classmate who bought a WordPress website last year, right? He will definitely recommend a good programmer to you. Recommendations are the most effective way of finding contractors. First, you don’t need to worry about screening and testing. Second, you’ll have a very good explanation for why your project failed—because your friend let you down with a bad recommendation. Win-win.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Hire only locals---they are much easier to manage and punish.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hire Only Locals&lt;/strong&gt;. Don’t even think about a remote programmer—remote projects always fail. &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/10/27/outsourcing-doesnt-work.html&quot;&gt;Always&lt;/a&gt;. He will work in a different time zone, you will always have cultural clashes, and his Russian accent will be annoying. You simply won’t be able to meet him every second day and &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/05/21/avoid-software-outsourcing-disaster.html&quot;&gt;whine&lt;/a&gt; about your project being too expensive, too slow, and too frustrating. Hire only locals—they are much easier to manage and &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/01/05/how-to-punish-employees.html&quot;&gt;punish&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t Offend With a Lack of Trust&lt;/strong&gt;. A talented professional programmer will be offended if you ask him to pass a test or prove some of his skills. That will demonstrate that you don’t trust him. And if you don’t trust him, you simply should not work together. Trust is the most important thing in any project. Also, don’t ask how certain things will be done. He is the professional you’re hiring, and he knows what he is doing. That’s enough.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fall in Love&lt;/strong&gt;. After trust, the most important thing is a personal connection between you two. I’m not saying you must fall in love with your programmer, but it won’t hurt. You should feel an emotional touch with him. Otherwise Java code won’t work like you need it to. If you can’t fall in love, you should at least become good friends. Invite him to your home parties, go to movies together, and introduce him to your wife. All of this will seriously affect the quality of the product he is creating.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t Specify Too Much&lt;/strong&gt;. That’s what &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/07/11/mistakes-in-agile-manifesto.html&quot;&gt;Agile&lt;/a&gt; recommends, and I second that—face-to-face communication is more valuable than documentation. Don’t write any documentation, don’t specify what exactly you need to develop, and don’t think too much about your “user stories.” It’s all in the past. Modern software engineers figure everything out by themselves. Just let him be creative and communicative. If something isn’t clear, just call him. Remember, a Skype call is &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/10/07/stop-chatting-start-coding.html&quot;&gt;always better&lt;/a&gt; than those boring documents that nobody knows how to write.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Motivate by Value&lt;/strong&gt;. In order to create a great software product, he must be very &lt;em&gt;excited&lt;/em&gt; about it. Make sure he is excited. If he is not excited, call him again. Motivate him. Talk to him. Explain to him your brilliant Google-killer business idea again and again. Until the moment he &lt;del&gt;screams&lt;/del&gt; says “I’m excited.” He must know what a great value your product is producing for the entirety of civilization. And he must be excited. Do I have to say it one more time? Excited! Are you excited already? I’m excited.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Promise Job Security&lt;/strong&gt;. Even if you just raised $2K for your startup from your wife’s step-dad, promise your programmer a cloudless financial future. He must know that you’ve got enough to pay him until he retires. A good programmer must want to work with you forever. That’s the type of programmer you need. You don’t want one of those greedy freelancers who always jumps from project to project. You need a long-term commitment. That’s why you have to pretend you’re rich enough.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Programmers in general are not really good in financial negotiations; use that to exploit them.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Delay Money Talks&lt;/strong&gt;. Don’t mention money for as long as you can. Ideally, ask him to create a prototype first and “then we’ll discuss your salary.” A good programmer doesn’t work for money. He works for satisfaction. That’s who you need. You should discuss value, excitement, features, market disruption, and anything else that’s important, but not money. Programmers in general are not really good in financial negotiations. Use that to exploit him for as much as you can.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t Negotiate&lt;/strong&gt;. Eventually you will have to discuss money. Make sure there will be no negotiation involved. It’ll be an offensive process, and most programmers are very sensitive. Just tell him how much you will pay, and if he doesn’t feel that is enough, get back to the value/excitement/market conversation. Do it again and again until he agrees.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Require Full Commitment&lt;/strong&gt;. Make sure he will be fully committed to the project. Ideally, he must not have any other projects or even any personal life at all. He must promise to be 100 percent with you and your idea. If he is planning on doing something else, demonstrate that it will offend you. Act jealous, like a loving wife. You don’t need a programmer who is interested in something else.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;You're going to be his leader, and a good leader is never too honest with subordinates.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make Him a Partner&lt;/strong&gt;. First of all, making him a partner will save you a lot of money. Ideally, you should convince him to work &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/10/29/how-much-do-you-cost.html&quot;&gt;for free&lt;/a&gt;. Good programmers are good entrepreneurs and like to take risks. A good programmer knows that in order to become the next Mark Zuckerberg, he must start at a job with no salary. Give him some &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/01/12/good-programmers-dont-work-for-equity.html&quot;&gt;equity&lt;/a&gt; and keep those motivational speeches coming. It’s a perfect money-saving technique.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be Positive&lt;/strong&gt;. Simply don’t tell him about your risks and concerns. The future of your project is bright, and he doesn’t need to know more. You’re going to be his &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/05/24/who-is-project-manager.html&quot;&gt;leader&lt;/a&gt;, and a good leader is never too honest with subordinates. Always be positive about the plan—he needs to get that from you.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;hr /&gt; &lt;p&gt;That should be enough to find and hire a good programmer.

Where and how do you find and hire a good programmer? Since I’m a programmer and I <a href="http://www.teamed.io">manage</a> software projects, I’m supposed to know the tricks. I do, of course; there are many of them, but the list below succinctly summarizes the most important ones.</p><figure class="jb_picture"><img itemprop="image" alt="Don&#39;t Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood (1996) by Paris Barclay" src="/images/2016/06/dont-be-a-menace-to-south-central-while-drinking-your-juice-in-the-hood.jpg" longdesc="#b00247d7" /><figcaption id="b00247d7">Don&#39;t Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood (1996) by Paris Barclay</figcaption></figure><p>I’ll be referring to “him,” but these recommendations apply equally to both female and male <del>slaves</del> software developers.</p><p><strong>Ask a Friend</strong>. The best way to find talent is through a reference. Who knows the software market better than your high school classmate who bought a WordPress website last year, right? He will definitely recommend a good programmer to you. Recommendations are the most effective way of finding contractors. First, you don’t need to worry about screening and testing. Second, you’ll have a very good explanation for why your project failed—because your friend let you down with a bad recommendation. Win-win.</p><aside class="quote">Hire only locals---they are much easier to manage and punish.</aside><p><strong>Hire Only Locals</strong>. Don’t even think about a remote programmer—remote projects always fail. <a href="/2015/10/27/outsourcing-doesnt-work.html">Always</a>. He will work in a different time zone, you will always have cultural clashes, and his Russian accent will be annoying. You simply won’t be able to meet him every second day and <a href="/2015/05/21/avoid-software-outsourcing-disaster.html">whine</a> about your project being too expensive, too slow, and too frustrating. Hire only locals—they are much easier to manage and <a href="/2016/01/05/how-to-punish-employees.html">punish</a>.</p><p><strong>Don’t Offend With a Lack of Trust</strong>. A talented professional programmer will be offended if you ask him to pass a test or prove some of his skills. That will demonstrate that you don’t trust him. And if you don’t trust him, you simply should not work together. Trust is the most important thing in any project. Also, don’t ask how certain things will be done. He is the professional you’re hiring, and he knows what he is doing. That’s enough.</p><p><strong>Fall in Love</strong>. After trust, the most important thing is a personal connection between you two. I’m not saying you must fall in love with your programmer, but it won’t hurt. You should feel an emotional touch with him. Otherwise Java code won’t work like you need it to. If you can’t fall in love, you should at least become good friends. Invite him to your home parties, go to movies together, and introduce him to your wife. All of this will seriously affect the quality of the product he is creating.</p><p><strong>Don’t Specify Too Much</strong>. That’s what <a href="/2016/07/11/mistakes-in-agile-manifesto.html">Agile</a> recommends, and I second that—face-to-face communication is more valuable than documentation. Don’t write any documentation, don’t specify what exactly you need to develop, and don’t think too much about your “user stories.” It’s all in the past. Modern software engineers figure everything out by themselves. Just let him be creative and communicative. If something isn’t clear, just call him. Remember, a Skype call is <a href="/2014/10/07/stop-chatting-start-coding.html">always better</a> than those boring documents that nobody knows how to write.</p><p><strong>Motivate by Value</strong>. In order to create a great software product, he must be very <em>excited</em> about it. Make sure he is excited. If he is not excited, call him again. Motivate him. Talk to him. Explain to him your brilliant Google-killer business idea again and again. Until the moment he <del>screams</del> says “I’m excited.” He must know what a great value your product is producing for the entirety of civilization. And he must be excited. Do I have to say it one more time? Excited! Are you excited already? I’m excited.</p><p><strong>Promise Job Security</strong>. Even if you just raised $2K for your startup from your wife’s step-dad, promise your programmer a cloudless financial future. He must know that you’ve got enough to pay him until he retires. A good programmer must want to work with you forever. That’s the type of programmer you need. You don’t want one of those greedy freelancers who always jumps from project to project. You need a long-term commitment. That’s why you have to pretend you’re rich enough.</p><aside class="quote">Programmers in general are not really good in financial negotiations; use that to exploit them.</aside><p><strong>Delay Money Talks</strong>. Don’t mention money for as long as you can. Ideally, ask him to create a prototype first and “then we’ll discuss your salary.” A good programmer doesn’t work for money. He works for satisfaction. That’s who you need. You should discuss value, excitement, features, market disruption, and anything else that’s important, but not money. Programmers in general are not really good in financial negotiations. Use that to exploit him for as much as you can.</p><p><strong>Don’t Negotiate</strong>. Eventually you will have to discuss money. Make sure there will be no negotiation involved. It’ll be an offensive process, and most programmers are very sensitive. Just tell him how much you will pay, and if he doesn’t feel that is enough, get back to the value/excitement/market conversation. Do it again and again until he agrees.</p><p><strong>Require Full Commitment</strong>. Make sure he will be fully committed to the project. Ideally, he must not have any other projects or even any personal life at all. He must promise to be 100 percent with you and your idea. If he is planning on doing something else, demonstrate that it will offend you. Act jealous, like a loving wife. You don’t need a programmer who is interested in something else.</p><aside class="quote">You're going to be his leader, and a good leader is never too honest with subordinates.</aside><p><strong>Make Him a Partner</strong>. First of all, making him a partner will save you a lot of money. Ideally, you should convince him to work <a href="/2014/10/29/how-much-do-you-cost.html">for free</a>. Good programmers are good entrepreneurs and like to take risks. A good programmer knows that in order to become the next Mark Zuckerberg, he must start at a job with no salary. Give him some <a href="/2016/01/12/good-programmers-dont-work-for-equity.html">equity</a> and keep those motivational speeches coming. It’s a perfect money-saving technique.</p><p><strong>Be Positive</strong>. Simply don’t tell him about your risks and concerns. The future of your project is bright, and he doesn’t need to know more. You’re going to be his <a href="/2016/05/24/who-is-project-manager.html">leader</a>, and a good leader is never too honest with subordinates. Always be positive about the plan—he needs to get that from you.</p><hr /><p>That should be enough to find and hire a good programmer. Interestingly enough, I just re-read this text one last time and it looks to me like a “how to find a wife” tutorial. Don’t you think? Anyway, did I forget anything?

It’s risky and some people may disagree with you. That’s not good. The goal is to have everybody in the room completely agree with what you’re saying. That’s how you make a good speech. The audience will be comfortable and relaxed, and you will have no risk of being questioned afterwards. A few safe headline examples: “trust is very important” or “software must be stable.” Everybody will be nodding their heads—that’s all you need.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Joke!&lt;/strong&gt; You must make them laugh. You must open with a joke and continue with many of them. Prepare them carefully. Just Google “good keynote jokes” and use what smart people recommend. A well-prepared collection of jokes is much more valuable than the content you will be talking about. Nobody will remember the content, but the jokes will definitely be re-tweeted. When a good speaker is talking, the room is laughing every 60 seconds.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;A well-prepared collection of jokes is much more valuable than the content you will be talking about.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Swear!&lt;/strong&gt; Don’t be too formal and boring, show a slide with a picture of a naked butt every once in a while. Everybody will understand that you’re not only a speaker but also a good friend. Also, your language should be rather loose. Pretend you’re talking to a friend over a pint of beer. Remember, the goal is to be funny.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Repeat!&lt;/strong&gt; Always bring the same content with you, to all &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/06/03/conference-mistakes.html&quot;&gt;conferences&lt;/a&gt;. It’s easier for everybody. First, conference organizers will know for sure what will you be talking about. They can even watch your 4-year-old video-recorded presentation and see exactly what words and slides you’re planning to use. Second, you won’t be nervous, since you’ll be saying the same jokes over and over again. Everybody wins.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kitties!&lt;/strong&gt; Cute kitties. We all love them! Attach them somehow to your content. It is not really important whether they are related or not. You must show love. Instead of cats you can use a picture of your 2-y.o. daughter or yourself in a primary school. It has to be something sweet and adorable.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keep talking!&lt;/strong&gt; A good keynote speech fills the entire 60 minutes, leaving absolutely no time for questions. Actually, a perfect speaker will be interrupted after the 145th slide and will say that if anyone wants to know more, there is always a place near the restroom, let’s go there and continue. Thus, be focused on your slides and try to avoid questions at the end—they may create a negative impression of you if you mess up answering their questions. They came to listen to you, not to ask questions—keep talking.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;hr /&gt; &lt;p&gt;On a more serious note, I’m very disappointed by what I’ve seen in almost all conferences so far. These keynote speakers are in most cases just making money, delivering the same “fun” again and again. They make $2-3K a speech and we, the listeners, get absolutely nothing new out of them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Conference organizers keep inviting them, just because of the names. And we keep attending that conferences also just because of the names. But do these names really mean anything? I don’t think so. These guys are, in most cases, just retired losers with good presentation skills.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It would be much better to spend the money conferences waste on the big-names for training practical speakers from the trenches, with really fresh and interesting content.

I think I now know all the secrets of a successful keynote speaker. It doesn’t look so difficult to become one. Here are my thoughts.</p><figure class="jb_picture"><img itemprop="image" alt="Bean (1997) by Mel Smith" src="/images/2016/05/bean.jpg" longdesc="#76a22317" /><figcaption id="76a22317">Bean (1997) by Mel Smith</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Be obvious!</strong> Don’t take a chance by suggesting something new. It’s risky and some people may disagree with you. That’s not good. The goal is to have everybody in the room completely agree with what you’re saying. That’s how you make a good speech. The audience will be comfortable and relaxed, and you will have no risk of being questioned afterwards. A few safe headline examples: “trust is very important” or “software must be stable.” Everybody will be nodding their heads—that’s all you need.</p><p><strong>Joke!</strong> You must make them laugh. You must open with a joke and continue with many of them. Prepare them carefully. Just Google “good keynote jokes” and use what smart people recommend. A well-prepared collection of jokes is much more valuable than the content you will be talking about. Nobody will remember the content, but the jokes will definitely be re-tweeted. When a good speaker is talking, the room is laughing every 60 seconds.</p><aside class="quote">A well-prepared collection of jokes is much more valuable than the content you will be talking about.</aside><p><strong>Swear!</strong> Don’t be too formal and boring, show a slide with a picture of a naked butt every once in a while. Everybody will understand that you’re not only a speaker but also a good friend. Also, your language should be rather loose. Pretend you’re talking to a friend over a pint of beer. Remember, the goal is to be funny.</p><p><strong>Repeat!</strong> Always bring the same content with you, to all <a href="/2016/06/03/conference-mistakes.html">conferences</a>. It’s easier for everybody. First, conference organizers will know for sure what will you be talking about. They can even watch your 4-year-old video-recorded presentation and see exactly what words and slides you’re planning to use. Second, you won’t be nervous, since you’ll be saying the same jokes over and over again. Everybody wins.</p><p><strong>Kitties!</strong> Cute kitties. We all love them! Attach them somehow to your content. It is not really important whether they are related or not. You must show love. Instead of cats you can use a picture of your 2-y.o. daughter or yourself in a primary school. It has to be something sweet and adorable.</p><p><strong>Keep talking!</strong> A good keynote speech fills the entire 60 minutes, leaving absolutely no time for questions. Actually, a perfect speaker will be interrupted after the 145th slide and will say that if anyone wants to know more, there is always a place near the restroom, let’s go there and continue. Thus, be focused on your slides and try to avoid questions at the end—they may create a negative impression of you if you mess up answering their questions. They came to listen to you, not to ask questions—keep talking.</p><hr /><p>On a more serious note, I’m very disappointed by what I’ve seen in almost all conferences so far. These keynote speakers are in most cases just making money, delivering the same “fun” again and again. They make $2-3K a speech and we, the listeners, get absolutely nothing new out of them.</p><p>Conference organizers keep inviting them, just because of the names. And we keep attending that conferences also just because of the names. But do these names really mean anything? I don’t think so. These guys are, in most cases, just retired losers with good presentation skills.</p><p>It would be much better to spend the money conferences waste on the big-names for training practical speakers from the trenches, with really fresh and interesting content.

Basically, your success doesn’t depend on much of anything else. The pitch is king. You have to impress the &lt;del&gt;catcher&lt;/del&gt; investor in just a few seconds while the elevator is still moving (that’s where you are supposed to hunt for that prey). It’s not rocket science; you can learn a few basic principles and become a expert. Here they are, the principles.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;!--more--&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;jb_picture&quot;&gt;&lt;img itemprop=&quot;image&quot; alt=&quot;Huevos de oro (1993) by Bigas Luna&quot; src=&quot;/images/2016/03/huevos-de-oro.jpg&quot; longdesc=&quot;#06c2164b&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption id=&quot;06c2164b&quot;&gt;Huevos de oro (1993) by Bigas Luna&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Look&lt;/strong&gt;. Rule number 1: You must look right, like Mark Zuckerberg—the same gray T-shirt every day with the same smile. The way you look must demonstrate that you’re part of the community. You’re one of us! These three things will help: a beard, an electric skateboard, and an Apple Watch. If you’re a girl, replace the beard with a yoga mat and you’re all set. By looking that way, you’re telling investors that your chances to succeed are way higher than anyone who doesn’t have an Apple Watch and is a stranger because of that.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Anyone who doesn't have an Apple Watch is a stranger&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Innovate&lt;/strong&gt;. These are the words you must include in your pitch: innovation, innovative, innovate. It’s never too many. Put them (or their synonyms) everywhere; it’s all for good. How about this: “Our innovative solution is an environmental breakthrough?” Nobody knows what it means, but everybody understands that you’re a big-time innovator. Even if it’s yet another calorie calculator. Investors must understand that you’re not just making a software product; you &lt;em&gt;innovate&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Complicate&lt;/strong&gt;. Internet of Things in lieu of a thermometer, augmented reality instead of goggles with a camera, and global health rather than a database of dentists. You get the idea. Don’t be specific; it’s dangerous. They may ask you what kind of database it is and how it’s different than the other 50 databases on the market. But if you say global health, they won’t have any idea what you’re talking about, which is exactly what you need. Learn those words and use them whenever possible. Here are some of my favorites for you to remember: business model canvas, viral mechanics, growth hacking, data-driven mentality, design thinking, and game-changing disruption.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;But be careful, don't overact or you may end up in a mental hospital&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Smile&lt;/strong&gt;. You are super excited about this fantastic opportunity! You’re extremely motivated to do this project with these absolutely great people! You’re passionate about the idea and fully committed to implementing it! You love the team, the partners, the investors, and the customers—they’re all very nice people you’re happy to work with! You’re very enthusiastic about everything! You love everyone! … But be careful; don’t overact or you may end up in a mental hospital.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Compare&lt;/strong&gt;. Compare yourself to Uber; you will never lose. It was Airbnb a few years ago and Dropbox before that. Today it’s Uber. Start your pitch with “It’s like Uber but …” No matter what you put after that, it will work. All investors are dreaming about getting a new Uber in their portfolio. You should help them make this dream come true. There’s no need to be too complicated; just say you’re “like Uber but …” and your chances to score Round A will jump higher.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Imitate&lt;/strong&gt;. Elon Musk! You have to mention this guy; you absolutely must. Try this: “As Elon Musk said in his book, it is very difficult to build a successful startup.” You, being aware of wisdom like that, give them the impression that you’re related to the Silicon Valley culture, which is what they want to feel. Always try to show that Elon Musk is a role model for you. Having a T-shirt featuring his face will also help. By the way, don’t use Steve Jobs; it’s not a trend anymore. Moreover, he is dead already. Stick to Musk.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Never compete with them or even try to argue, investors are always right&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Respect&lt;/strong&gt;. Always remember that you and your potential investors are not equal. They have money, experience, reputation, and a Tesla. You have nothing. You must demonstrate that you always remember that. Always position yourself a bit lower, play newbie, ask questions, and imitate interest in everything they say. Never compete with them or even try to argue! They are always right, and they are simply awesome; you’re just another nobody. Something like “I’m honored to be in the same room with you” is a very good opener.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Co-Found&lt;/strong&gt;. You absolutely must have a co-founder, or even a few of them. They could be anybody. A roommate will work or just a friend of a friend who recently quit her full-time job. It doesn’t matter who they are as long as you can call them co-founders. Put their pictures and names on your website and always say “we” instead of “I.” Investors, in general, love to have a few phone numbers they can call when they realize their money is gone and there is nothing left. Also, it’s more fun to invest into a group of people—investors look more serious in that case.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Never admit any mistakes or risks, simply ignore them, stay positive&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Radiate&lt;/strong&gt;. Never say anything bad about anything or anyone. You literally have to be 100% in &lt;em&gt;positive thinking&lt;/em&gt; mode. That competitor who is stealing your customers is “such a nice guy.” That cup of coffee made of some dark powder is “very delicious.” The programmers from Pakistan you found on Upwork for $10 per hour are “absolutely awesome.” The marketing plan you invented yesterday is “simply great.” Never admit any mistakes, risks, or threats. Simply ignore them. Stay positive. Investors like that.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bluff&lt;/strong&gt;. You have to mention that the market is absolutely huge, at least a hundred billion dollars. They won’t be able to check anyway. Actually, nobody can check that, so don’t worry. But don’t give a round number; that would be a mistake! It should sound more like $73.5 billion. That’s very convincing and will give them the confidence you need—the market is huge and you’re not just saying it; you actually did some math. How can they not invest in such a huge and promising market?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scream&lt;/strong&gt;. Especially if you’re in a public place, you must speak as if you’re a bit deaf. Be loud. That will prove that you’re absolutely confident in what you’re saying, today and always. The investor will be sure you are capable of attracting &lt;del&gt;mates&lt;/del&gt; customers and other investors, if for no other reason than because you’re not afraid of being that ugly loud in public. You’re 100% extrovert—you must demonstrate it shamelessly.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;You must be ready to shine their shoes, with a big smile on your face&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beg&lt;/strong&gt;. You may mistakenly think that this is a balanced transaction—they give money and you give part of your equity. You may expect that both parties are equally interested in this. But don’t make that mistake. You’re begging, and they are giving. Out of courtesy. That’s a win position for you. By having money, they expect to be on top of others. This is what capitalism is about, right? Don’t take this away from them. You must be ready to shine their shoes. With a big smile on your face.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Love&lt;/strong&gt;. The truth is that investors don’t want to make money. They want to make love. You’re a perfect candidate. They are mostly old, rich, lonely, and miserable. Their success stories are behind them. All they have is money, which they are afraid to spend because they understand that they won’t make it again. They are used-to-be successful gamblers, but not anymore. Give them what they want: love. Money is not so important, so long as you love each other. Remember, first they must fall in love with you, then they will send the terms sheet.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Did I miss anything?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Rehearse your pitch in front of the mirror in the bathroom three times every morning. I guarantee that in fewer than two weeks, you will sound like a proper SV startup founder. Well, a co-founder—don’t forget that. Good luck; you will need a lot of it!&lt;/p&gt; " /> <meta name="keywords" content="next, path, output, content, previous, url, relative_path, id, collection, excerpt, draft, categories, layout, title, date, place, tags, description, keywords, image, jb_picture, slug, ext" /> <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1"/> <meta name="google-site-verification" content="JEj_gQr2CPe2QKGw8XdMz0R7VboQIUbX3FlM-lwTq-8" /> <meta name="author" content="Yegor Bugayenko"> <meta name="article:published_time" content="2016-03-28 00:00:00 +0000"> <meta name="og:site_name" content="Yegor Bugayenko"/> <meta name="og:type" content="article" /> <meta name="og:locale" content="en_US" /> <meta name="twitter:account_id" content="4503599630178231" /> <meta name="twitter:creator" content="@yegor256"/> <meta name="twitter:site" content="@yegor256"/> <meta name="twitter:title" property="og:title" content="Unspoken Secrets of an Elevator Pitch"/> <meta name="twitter:description" property="og:description" content="&lt;p&gt;Your success depends on the quality of your &lt;strong&gt;elevator pitch&lt;/strong&gt;.

The truth is that investors don’t want to make money. They want to make love. You’re a perfect candidate. They are mostly old, rich, lonely, and miserable. Their success stories are behind them. All they have is money, which they are afraid to spend because they understand that they won’t make it again. They are used-to-be successful gamblers, but not anymore. Give them what they want: love. Money is not so important, so long as you love each other. Remember, first they must fall in love with you, then they will send the terms sheet.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Did I miss anything?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Rehearse your pitch in front of the mirror in the bathroom three times every morning. I guarantee that in fewer than two weeks, you will sound like a proper SV startup founder. Well, a co-founder—don’t forget that. Good luck; you will need a lot of it!&lt;/p&gt; "/> <meta name="twitter:url" property="og:url" content="https://www.yegor256.com/2016/03/28/unspoken-secrets-of-elevator-pitch.html"/> <meta

Basically, your success doesn’t depend on much of anything else. The pitch is king. You have to impress the <del>catcher</del> investor in just a few seconds while the elevator is still moving (that’s where you are supposed to hunt for that prey). It’s not rocket science; you can learn a few basic principles and become a expert. Here they are, the principles.</p><figure class="jb_picture"><img itemprop="image" alt="Huevos de oro (1993) by Bigas Luna" src="/images/2016/03/huevos-de-oro.jpg" longdesc="#06c2164b" /><figcaption id="06c2164b">Huevos de oro (1993) by Bigas Luna</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Look</strong>. Rule number 1: You must look right, like Mark Zuckerberg—the same gray T-shirt every day with the same smile. The way you look must demonstrate that you’re part of the community. You’re one of us! These three things will help: a beard, an electric skateboard, and an Apple Watch. If you’re a girl, replace the beard with a yoga mat and you’re all set. By looking that way, you’re telling investors that your chances to succeed are way higher than anyone who doesn’t have an Apple Watch and is a stranger because of that.</p><aside class="quote">Anyone who doesn't have an Apple Watch is a stranger</aside><p><strong>Innovate</strong>. These are the words you must include in your pitch: innovation, innovative, innovate. It’s never too many. Put them (or their synonyms) everywhere; it’s all for good. How about this: “Our innovative solution is an environmental breakthrough?” Nobody knows what it means, but everybody understands that you’re a big-time innovator. Even if it’s yet another calorie calculator. Investors must understand that you’re not just making a software product; you <em>innovate</em>.</p><p><strong>Complicate</strong>. Internet of Things in lieu of a thermometer, augmented reality instead of goggles with a camera, and global health rather than a database of dentists. You get the idea. Don’t be specific; it’s dangerous. They may ask you what kind of database it is and how it’s different than the other 50 databases on the market. But if you say global health, they won’t have any idea what you’re talking about, which is exactly what you need. Learn those words and use them whenever possible. Here are some of my favorites for you to remember: business model canvas, viral mechanics, growth hacking, data-driven mentality, design thinking, and game-changing disruption.</p><aside class="quote">But be careful, don't overact or you may end up in a mental hospital</aside><p><strong>Smile</strong>. You are super excited about this fantastic opportunity! You’re extremely motivated to do this project with these absolutely great people! You’re passionate about the idea and fully committed to implementing it! You love the team, the partners, the investors, and the customers—they’re all very nice people you’re happy to work with! You’re very enthusiastic about everything! You love everyone! … But be careful; don’t overact or you may end up in a mental hospital.</p><p><strong>Compare</strong>. Compare yourself to Uber; you will never lose. It was Airbnb a few years ago and Dropbox before that. Today it’s Uber. Start your pitch with “It’s like Uber but …” No matter what you put after that, it will work. All investors are dreaming about getting a new Uber in their portfolio. You should help them make this dream come true. There’s no need to be too complicated; just say you’re “like Uber but …” and your chances to score Round A will jump higher.</p><p><strong>Imitate</strong>. Elon Musk! You have to mention this guy; you absolutely must. Try this: “As Elon Musk said in his book, it is very difficult to build a successful startup.” You, being aware of wisdom like that, give them the impression that you’re related to the Silicon Valley culture, which is what they want to feel. Always try to show that Elon Musk is a role model for you. Having a T-shirt featuring his face will also help. By the way, don’t use Steve Jobs; it’s not a trend anymore. Moreover, he is dead already. Stick to Musk.</p><aside class="quote">Never compete with them or even try to argue, investors are always right</aside><p><strong>Respect</strong>. Always remember that you and your potential investors are not equal. They have money, experience, reputation, and a Tesla. You have nothing. You must demonstrate that you always remember that. Always position yourself a bit lower, play newbie, ask questions, and imitate interest in everything they say. Never compete with them or even try to argue! They are always right, and they are simply awesome; you’re just another nobody. Something like “I’m honored to be in the same room with you” is a very good opener.</p><p><strong>Co-Found</strong>. You absolutely must have a co-founder, or even a few of them. They could be anybody. A roommate will work or just a friend of a friend who recently quit her full-time job. It doesn’t matter who they are as long as you can call them co-founders. Put their pictures and names on your website and always say “we” instead of “I.” Investors, in general, love to have a few phone numbers they can call when they realize their money is gone and there is nothing left. Also, it’s more fun to invest into a group of people—investors look more serious in that case.</p><aside class="quote">Never admit any mistakes or risks, simply ignore them, stay positive</aside><p><strong>Radiate</strong>. Never say anything bad about anything or anyone. You literally have to be 100% in <em>positive thinking</em> mode. That competitor who is stealing your customers is “such a nice guy.” That cup of coffee made of some dark powder is “very delicious.” The programmers from Pakistan you found on Upwork for $10 per hour are “absolutely awesome.” The marketing plan you invented yesterday is “simply great.” Never admit any mistakes, risks, or threats. Simply ignore them. Stay positive. Investors like that.</p><p><strong>Bluff</strong>. You have to mention that the market is absolutely huge, at least a hundred billion dollars. They won’t be able to check anyway. Actually, nobody can check that, so don’t worry. But don’t give a round number; that would be a mistake! It should sound more like $73.5 billion. That’s very convincing and will give them the confidence you need—the market is huge and you’re not just saying it; you actually did some math. How can they not invest in such a huge and promising market?</p><p><strong>Scream</strong>. Especially if you’re in a public place, you must speak as if you’re a bit deaf. Be loud. That will prove that you’re absolutely confident in what you’re saying, today and always. The investor will be sure you are capable of attracting <del>mates</del> customers and other investors, if for no other reason than because you’re not afraid of being that ugly loud in public. You’re 100% extrovert—you must demonstrate it shamelessly.</p><aside class="quote">You must be ready to shine their shoes, with a big smile on your face</aside><p><strong>Beg</strong>. You may mistakenly think that this is a balanced transaction—they give money and you give part of your equity. You may expect that both parties are equally interested in this. But don’t make that mistake. You’re begging, and they are giving. Out of courtesy. That’s a win position for you. By having money, they expect to be on top of others. This is what capitalism is about, right? Don’t take this away from them. You must be ready to shine their shoes. With a big smile on your face.</p><p><strong>Love</strong>. The truth is that investors don’t want to make money. They want to make love. You’re a perfect candidate. They are mostly old, rich, lonely, and miserable. Their success stories are behind them. All they have is money, which they are afraid to spend because they understand that they won’t make it again. They are used-to-be successful gamblers, but not anymore. Give them what they want: love.

There are many ways to punish employees; some are rather effective, while others simply don’t work. This is not an exact science. Actually, I would say it’s an &lt;em&gt;art&lt;/em&gt;. You must be creative, innovative, and very open-minded. You never know which method of punishment will work with whom. Some people respond to one method, while others may completely ignore it. The overarching goal, of course, is to make employees &lt;em&gt;scared&lt;/em&gt; of &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt;, their boss, so they will obey enthusiastically.

This, of course, is your best instrument of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punishment&quot;&gt;punishment&lt;/a&gt;. Make sure he is scared of you. He must know who he &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/01/26/happy-boss-false-objective.html&quot;&gt;works for&lt;/a&gt;—you, his boss. The rule of thumb is that the one with the strongest voice is the boss. Thus, you must be heard, you must &lt;em&gt;rule&lt;/em&gt; with your voice, and he must physically feel your presence in the room. Even if it’s just a Skype &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/08/23/communication-maturity.html&quot;&gt;call&lt;/a&gt;, your voice must sound stronger than all others. Moreover, don’t let him speak if he is trying to &lt;a href=&quot;/2017/01/03/how-much-you-love-conflicts.html&quot;&gt;argue back&lt;/a&gt;. You’re the boss!

Or, even better, schedule &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/07/13/meetings-are-legalized-robbery.html&quot;&gt;meetings&lt;/a&gt; and don’t show up. Or reschedule many times. That will demonstrate that you’re not interested in him anymore. His frustration will grow. You’ll still be in the office, having meetings with other employees, eating lunch, laughing, walking, and talking. You exist, but not for him. He is dead to you, because of his mistake. He is nothing and is getting the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silent_treatment&quot;&gt;silent treatment&lt;/a&gt;. Then, suddenly, you attend a meeting! Oh, how happy he will be. He will literally kiss your hands, and you will love that feeling!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make Fun of Him&lt;/strong&gt;. We inherit this technique from good, old-school &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullying&quot;&gt;bullying&lt;/a&gt;. We all know how it works. Select the person who messed up and make him the target of your jokes. In the office, this method works even better than in school, because you’re the boss and he basically can’t do anything to you. He will first try to laugh alongside everybody else, but this won’t last for the long term. In the end, everybody will laugh at him, and he will do whatever it takes just to stop it. He will obey any order you give!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Having a personal life outside the office is not for everybody; it is a luxury.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mistakes Must be Visible&lt;/strong&gt;. Is he wrong? Did he miss a deadline? Did he deploy a broken version to production? Did he forget something? Don’t resolve this face to face. Always make such things public, simply to let others punish him. This approach is known as &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer_pressure&quot;&gt;peer pressure&lt;/a&gt;, a very useful technique. His coworkers must keep up the momentum and punish him using &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_rejection&quot;&gt;social rejection&lt;/a&gt;. That’s why, by all means, you as a leader must encourage back-stabbing. You will rise to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_and_control_in_abusive_relationships&quot;&gt;power&lt;/a&gt; much faster if your employees are not only afraid of you but also of each other. Use their fear wisely!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Late-Night Phone Calls&lt;/strong&gt;. Having a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_life&quot;&gt;personal life&lt;/a&gt; outside the office is not for everybody. It is a luxury, and you are not just going to give it away. He must earn it, and if he is guilty of not completing a task on time, his private life will be ruined by your late-night phone calls. He must remember that. It doesn’t really matter what exactly the calls are about. Just make them somewhere around 11 p.m. Your key message is this: “I’m worrying about the project while you’re enjoying your family time!” Guilt is what you’re planting with this. He won’t be able to ask you not to call him after work; he is not that brave. He will instead try to please you somehow so that you stop calling him.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;youtube&quot;&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibT5oKToMoQ&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;box&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ibT5oKToMoQ/mqdefault.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;YouTube video #ibT5oKToMoQ&quot; /&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;play&quot;&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;icon icon-play&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;div&gt;Daily Stand-Up Meetings Are Evil (webinar #11); 3 February 2016.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t Check Results&lt;/strong&gt;. This technique is close to playing hard to get, but here you don’t ignore him. You communicate with the guilty employee, but you don’t talk about his results. You discuss his uncle’s wedding, his snowboarding weekend, his new bicycle, etc. But you don’t ask about the migration to PostgreSQL he has been working on for the last three weeks. You are &lt;em&gt;not interested&lt;/em&gt;. This is a perfect method for demonstrating that you don’t see him as a valuable team member anymore. The &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/02/18/holacracy-autocracy.html&quot;&gt;team&lt;/a&gt; doesn’t need his results. The team can live without them. You will see how soon he realizes who the boss is and what it means when the boss is not happy!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Obviously, the best desk is the one at which nobody can see your monitor.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Bad Office Spot Is a Great De-Motivator&lt;/strong&gt;. This is a classic instrument of punishment: The worst desks go to those who forget who the boss is around here. Obviously, the best desk is the one at which nobody can see your monitor. Give those to good people who obey your orders and don’t argue with you. They are your core team. They support you as a &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/05/24/who-is-project-manager.html&quot;&gt;leader&lt;/a&gt;, and they help you rise to power. Others must sit closer to the door, and their monitors must be seen by everybody. As with all other techniques, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_manipulation&quot;&gt;conceal&lt;/a&gt; your intentions—you locate people in the office due to their job descriptions in order to help them communicate effectively. Everybody will understand what’s really going on, but you must look like a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leadership_style#Laissez-faire&quot;&gt;laissez-faire leader&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Easy Tasks Are Rewards&lt;/strong&gt;. You decide who does what, and you distribute tasks and projects—that’s your instrument of power. Easy-to-do tasks are how you reward those who are &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/10/06/how-to-be-good-office-slave.html&quot;&gt;loyal&lt;/a&gt; and supportive. They complete such tasks, hardly expending any effort. Complex and risky projects, on the other hand, are assigned to the under-performing employee. He will most likely fail, and there won’t be anyone to blame—it’s just a project, like all others. Boring, ambiguous, unfocused, unnecessary, under-funded, and routine tasks all go to the employee who deserves punishment. Of course, you must look unbiased—be very polite and supportive, acting as if you’re a good friend!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Leaving the office at 5 p.m. is a privilege; only the best employees can afford it.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spread Rumors&lt;/strong&gt;. Simply show your annoyance of his poor results, but not to his face. Talk about his performance with his coworkers. They must know that you’re not happy. Furthermore, they must suspect that you’re thinking about &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/09/16/how-to-fire-someone-right.html&quot;&gt;terminating&lt;/a&gt; his contract. Don’t say it straight away, but don’t deny it if they ask. I doubt they will ask, though. Very soon, these rumors will reach his ear, and he will do whatever it takes just to hear that you’re not thinking about termination anymore. He will likely be scared to ask you directly, but even if he does ask, deny it. He will be afraid of you anyway. That will make him much more manageable!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Overtime&lt;/strong&gt;. Leaving the office at 5 p.m. is a privilege. Only the best employees can afford it. Ideally, everybody must ask you before they leave. The one who feels guilty won’t be comfortable asking you whether he can leave at 5 p.m. He will stay longer just because he is afraid to ask. That’s exactly what you need! Just to earn the ability to ask whether it’s possible to leave the office, he will work harder. The question is how to make employees ask for your permission to go home in the first place. I recommend you stay late and schedule interesting meetings at 6 p.m. Of course, you will come to work at 1 p.m., while everybody else must be there at 9 a.m. sharp. The point is that you must be in the office when they leave, and you must do something important. They will be afraid to disappoint you by showing ignorance, so they will ask for permission. That’s what you need!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;hr /&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;badge&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/2bNjruM&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.yegor256.com/images/2016/01/management-stripped-bare.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width:96px;max-width:100%;&quot; alt=&quot;badge&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;This list is definitely not exhaustive.

Easy-to-do tasks are how you reward those who are &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/10/06/how-to-be-good-office-slave.html&quot;&gt;loyal&lt;/a&gt; and supportive. They complete such tasks, hardly expending any effort. Complex and risky projects, on the other hand, are assigned to the under-performing employee. He will most likely fail, and there won’t be anyone to blame—it’s just a project, like all others. Boring, ambiguous, unfocused, unnecessary, under-funded, and routine tasks all go to the employee who deserves punishment. Of course, you must look unbiased—be very polite and supportive, acting as if you’re a good friend!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Leaving the office at 5 p.m. is a privilege; only the best employees can afford it.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spread Rumors&lt;/strong&gt;. Simply show your annoyance of his poor results, but not to his face. Talk about his performance with his coworkers. They must know that you’re not happy. Furthermore, they must suspect that you’re thinking about &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/09/16/how-to-fire-someone-right.html&quot;&gt;terminating&lt;/a&gt; his contract. Don’t say it straight away, but don’t deny it if they ask. I doubt they will ask, though. Very soon, these rumors will reach his ear, and he will do whatever it takes just to hear that you’re not thinking about termination anymore. He will likely be scared to ask you directly, but even if he does ask, deny it. He will be afraid of you anyway. That will make him much more manageable!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Overtime&lt;/strong&gt;. Leaving the office at 5 p.m. is a privilege. Only the best employees can afford it. Ideally, everybody must ask you before they leave. The one who feels guilty won’t be comfortable asking you whether he can leave at 5 p.m. He will stay longer just because he is afraid to ask. That’s exactly what you need! Just to earn the ability to ask whether it’s possible to leave the office, he will work harder. The question is how to make employees ask for your permission to go home in the first place. I recommend you stay late and schedule interesting meetings at 6 p.m. Of course, you will come to work at 1 p.m., while everybody else must be there at 9 a.m. sharp. The point is that you must be in the office when they leave, and you must do something important. They will be afraid to disappoint you by showing ignorance, so they will ask for permission. That’s what you need!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;hr /&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;badge&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/2bNjruM&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.yegor256.com/images/2016/01/management-stripped-bare.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width:96px;max-width:100%;&quot; alt=&quot;badge&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;This list is definitely not exhaustive.

do you prefer to do it? There are many ways to punish employees; some are rather effective, while others simply don’t work. This is not an exact science. Actually, I would say it’s an <em>art</em>. You must be creative, innovative, and very open-minded. You never know which method of punishment will work with whom. Some people respond to one method, while others may completely ignore it. The overarching goal, of course, is to make employees <em>scared</em> of <em>you</em>, their boss, so they will obey enthusiastically. Here is a list of the most effective methods.</p><figure class="jb_picture"><img itemprop="image" alt="Office Space (1999) by Mike Judge" src="/images/2016/01/office-space.jpg" longdesc="#cbdf548c" /><figcaption id="cbdf548c">Office Space (1999) by Mike Judge</figcaption></figure><p>Disclaimer: I’m using the pronoun “he” merely for simplicity of speech.

This, of course, is your best instrument of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punishment">punishment</a>. Make sure he is scared of you. He must know who he <a href="/2015/01/26/happy-boss-false-objective.html">works for</a>—you, his boss. The rule of thumb is that the one with the strongest voice is the boss. Thus, you must be heard, you must <em>rule</em> with your voice, and he must physically feel your presence in the room. Even if it’s just a Skype <a href="/2016/08/23/communication-maturity.html">call</a>, your voice must sound stronger than all others. Moreover, don’t let him speak if he is trying to <a href="/2017/01/03/how-much-you-love-conflicts.html">argue back</a>. You’re the boss! The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_%28ethology%29">alpha</a>!</p><p><strong>Play Hard to Get</strong>. Is he feeling <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guilt_%28emotion%29">guilty</a> for an error? Simply ignore him. Or, even better, schedule <a href="/2015/07/13/meetings-are-legalized-robbery.html">meetings</a> and don’t show up. Or reschedule many times. That will demonstrate that you’re not interested in him anymore. His frustration will grow. You’ll still be in the office, having meetings with other employees, eating lunch, laughing, walking, and talking. You exist, but not for him. He is dead to you, because of his mistake. He is nothing and is getting the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silent_treatment">silent treatment</a>. Then, suddenly, you attend a meeting! Oh, how happy he will be. He will literally kiss your hands, and you will love that feeling!</p><p><strong>Make Fun of Him</strong>. We inherit this technique from good, old-school <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullying">bullying</a>. We all know how it works. Select the person who messed up and make him the target of your jokes. In the office, this method works even better than in school, because you’re the boss and he basically can’t do anything to you. He will first try to laugh alongside everybody else, but this won’t last for the long term. In the end, everybody will laugh at him, and he will do whatever it takes just to stop it. He will obey any order you give!</p><aside class="quote">Having a personal life outside the office is not for everybody; it is a luxury.</aside><p><strong>Mistakes Must be Visible</strong>. Is he wrong? Did he miss a deadline? Did he deploy a broken version to production? Did he forget something? Don’t resolve this face to face. Always make such things public, simply to let others punish him. This approach is known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer_pressure">peer pressure</a>, a very useful technique. His coworkers must keep up the momentum and punish him using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_rejection">social rejection</a>. That’s why, by all means, you as a leader must encourage back-stabbing. You will rise to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_and_control_in_abusive_relationships">power</a> much faster if your employees are not only afraid of you but also of each other. Use their fear wisely!</p><p><strong>Late-Night Phone Calls</strong>. Having a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_life">personal life</a> outside the office is not for everybody. It is a luxury, and you are not just going to give it away. He must earn it, and if he is guilty of not completing a task on time, his private life will be ruined by your late-night phone calls. He must remember that. It doesn’t really matter what exactly the calls are about. Just make them somewhere around 11 p.m. Your key message is this: “I’m worrying about the project while you’re enjoying your family time!” Guilt is what you’re planting with this. He won’t be able to ask you not to call him after work; he is not that brave. He will instead try to please you somehow so that you stop calling him.</p><aside class="youtube"> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibT5oKToMoQ"><div class="box"> <img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ibT5oKToMoQ/mqdefault.jpg" alt="YouTube video #ibT5oKToMoQ" /><div class="play"><i class="icon icon-play"></i></div></div></a><div>Daily Stand-Up Meetings Are Evil (webinar #11); 3 February 2016.</div></aside><p><strong>Don’t Check Results</strong>. This technique is close to playing hard to get, but here you don’t ignore him. You communicate with the guilty employee, but you don’t talk about his results. You discuss his uncle’s wedding, his snowboarding weekend, his new bicycle, etc. But you don’t ask about the migration to PostgreSQL he has been working on for the last three weeks. You are <em>not interested</em>. This is a perfect method for demonstrating that you don’t see him as a valuable team member anymore. The <a href="/2016/02/18/holacracy-autocracy.html">team</a> doesn’t need his results. The team can live without them. You will see how soon he realizes who the boss is and what it means when the boss is not happy!</p><aside class="quote">Obviously, the best desk is the one at which nobody can see your monitor.</aside><p><strong>A Bad Office Spot Is a Great De-Motivator</strong>. This is a classic instrument of punishment: The worst desks go to those who forget who the boss is around here. Obviously, the best desk is the one at which nobody can see your monitor. Give those to good people who obey your orders and don’t argue with you. They are your core team. They support you as a <a href="/2016/05/24/who-is-project-manager.html">leader</a>, and they help you rise to power. Others must sit closer to the door, and their monitors must be seen by everybody. As with all other techniques, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_manipulation">conceal</a> your intentions—you locate people in the office due to their job descriptions in order to help them communicate effectively. Everybody will understand what’s really going on, but you must look like a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leadership_style#Laissez-faire">laissez-faire leader</a>.</p><p><strong>Easy Tasks Are Rewards</strong>.

Moreover, don’t let him speak if he is trying to <a href="/2017/01/03/how-much-you-love-conflicts.html">argue back</a>. You’re the boss! The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_%28ethology%29">alpha</a>!</p><p><strong>Play Hard to Get</strong>. Is he feeling <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guilt_%28emotion%29">guilty</a> for an error? Simply ignore him. Or, even better, schedule <a href="/2015/07/13/meetings-are-legalized-robbery.html">meetings</a> and don’t show up. Or reschedule many times. That will demonstrate that you’re not interested in him anymore. His frustration will grow. You’ll still be in the office, having meetings with other employees, eating lunch, laughing, walking, and talking. You exist, but not for him. He is dead to you, because of his mistake. He is nothing and is getting the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silent_treatment">silent treatment</a>. Then, suddenly, you attend a meeting! Oh, how happy he will be. He will literally kiss your hands, and you will love that feeling!</p><p><strong>Make Fun of Him</strong>. We inherit this technique from good, old-school <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullying">bullying</a>. We all know how it works. Select the person who messed up and make him the target of your jokes. In the office, this method works even better than in school, because you’re the boss and he basically can’t do anything to you. He will first try to laugh alongside everybody else, but this won’t last for the long term. In the end, everybody will laugh at him, and he will do whatever it takes just to stop it. He will obey any order you give!</p><aside class="quote">Having a personal life outside the office is not for everybody; it is a luxury.</aside><p><strong>Mistakes Must be Visible</strong>. Is he wrong? Did he miss a deadline? Did he deploy a broken version to production? Did he forget something? Don’t resolve this face to face. Always make such things public, simply to let others punish him. This approach is known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer_pressure">peer pressure</a>, a very useful technique. His coworkers must keep up the momentum and punish him using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_rejection">social rejection</a>. That’s why, by all means, you as a leader must encourage back-stabbing. You will rise to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_and_control_in_abusive_relationships">power</a> much faster if your employees are not only afraid of you but also of each other. Use their fear wisely!</p><p><strong>Late-Night Phone Calls</strong>. Having a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_life">personal life</a> outside the office is not for everybody. It is a luxury, and you are not just going to give it away. He must earn it, and if he is guilty of not completing a task on time, his private life will be ruined by your late-night phone calls. He must remember that. It doesn’t really matter what exactly the calls are about. Just make them somewhere around 11 p.m. Your key message is this: “I’m worrying about the project while you’re enjoying your family time!” Guilt is what you’re planting with this. He won’t be able to ask you not to call him after work; he is not that brave. He will instead try to please you somehow so that you stop calling him.</p><aside class="youtube"> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibT5oKToMoQ"><div class="box"> <img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ibT5oKToMoQ/mqdefault.jpg" alt="YouTube video #ibT5oKToMoQ" /><div class="play"><i class="icon icon-play"></i></div></div></a><div>Daily Stand-Up Meetings Are Evil (webinar #11); 3 February 2016.</div></aside><p><strong>Don’t Check Results</strong>. This technique is close to playing hard to get, but here you don’t ignore him. You communicate with the guilty employee, but you don’t talk about his results. You discuss his uncle’s wedding, his snowboarding weekend, his new bicycle, etc. But you don’t ask about the migration to PostgreSQL he has been working on for the last three weeks. You are <em>not interested</em>. This is a perfect method for demonstrating that you don’t see him as a valuable team member anymore. The <a href="/2016/02/18/holacracy-autocracy.html">team</a> doesn’t need his results. The team can live without them. You will see how soon he realizes who the boss is and what it means when the boss is not happy!</p><aside class="quote">Obviously, the best desk is the one at which nobody can see your monitor.</aside><p><strong>A Bad Office Spot Is a Great De-Motivator</strong>. This is a classic instrument of punishment: The worst desks go to those who forget who the boss is around here. Obviously, the best desk is the one at which nobody can see your monitor. Give those to good people who obey your orders and don’t argue with you. They are your core team. They support you as a <a href="/2016/05/24/who-is-project-manager.html">leader</a>, and they help you rise to power. Others must sit closer to the door, and their monitors must be seen by everybody. As with all other techniques, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_manipulation">conceal</a> your intentions—you locate people in the office due to their job descriptions in order to help them communicate effectively. Everybody will understand what’s really going on, but you must look like a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leadership_style#Laissez-faire">laissez-faire leader</a>.</p><p><strong>Easy Tasks Are Rewards</strong>. You decide who does what, and you distribute tasks and projects—that’s your instrument of power. Easy-to-do tasks are how you reward those who are <a href="/2015/10/06/how-to-be-good-office-slave.html">loyal</a> and supportive. They complete such tasks, hardly expending any effort. Complex and risky projects, on the other hand, are assigned to the under-performing employee. He will most likely fail, and there won’t be anyone to blame—it’s just a project, like all others. Boring, ambiguous, unfocused, unnecessary, under-funded, and routine tasks all go to the employee who deserves punishment. Of course, you must look unbiased—be very polite and supportive, acting as if you’re a good friend!</p><aside class="quote">Leaving the office at 5 p.m. is a privilege; only the best employees can afford it.</aside><p><strong>Spread Rumors</strong>. Simply show your annoyance of his poor results, but not to his face. Talk about his performance with his coworkers. They must know that you’re not happy. Furthermore, they must suspect that you’re thinking about <a href="/2015/09/16/how-to-fire-someone-right.html">terminating</a> his contract. Don’t say it straight away, but don’t deny it if they ask. I doubt they will ask, though. Very soon, these rumors will reach his ear, and he will do whatever it takes just to hear that you’re not thinking about termination anymore. He will likely be scared to ask you directly, but even if he does ask, deny it. He will be afraid of you anyway. That will make him much more manageable!</p><p><strong>Overtime</strong>. Leaving the office at 5 p.m. is a privilege. Only the best employees can afford it. Ideally, everybody must ask you before they leave. The one who feels guilty won’t be comfortable asking you whether he can leave at 5 p.m. He will stay longer just because he is afraid to ask. That’s exactly what you need! Just to earn the ability to ask whether it’s possible to leave the office, he will work harder. The question is how to make employees ask for your permission to go home in the first place. I recommend you stay late and schedule interesting meetings at 6 p.m. Of course, you will come to work at 1 p.m., while everybody else must be there at 9 a.m. sharp. The point is that you must be in the office when they leave, and you must do something important. They will be afraid to disappoint you by showing ignorance, so they will ask for permission. That’s what you need!</p><hr /> <figure class="badge"><a href="http://amzn.to/2bNjruM"><img src="https://www.yegor256.com/images/2016/01/management-stripped-bare.jpg" style="width:96px;max-width:100%;" alt="badge" /></a></figure><p>This list is definitely not exhaustive.

I assume you are sitting in the office right now, reading this blog post. Maybe you don’t like your office job, or maybe you enjoy it and feel excited to be close to your office friends. It doesn’t matter. What matters is that there is always an alternative to office slavery. I’m not talking about starting your own business. There are people in this world who work for someone without doing what is described below. They do exist, as well as companies that don’t turn their employees into slaves. I really hope you will eventually find one. In the meantime, this manual is for you :)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;!--more--&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;jb_picture&quot;&gt;&lt;img itemprop=&quot;image&quot; alt=&quot;The Office (2001–2003)&quot; src=&quot;/images/2015/10/the-office.jpg&quot; longdesc=&quot;#1003bba1&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption id=&quot;1003bba1&quot;&gt;The Office (2001–2003)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Help Others&lt;/strong&gt;. Find the stupidest newbies and help them. Regardless of what exactly you help them with, they should rely on you. Show them where the restroom is, recommend a good restaurant nearby, assist in an IDE installation, explain how the project works, and make standard jokes about the worst class in it. They must become your best friends—and not only them. Be helpful to everybody. No matter what is happening, everyone must know that you’re ready to help. Ideally, they all must depend on your kindness and readiness to save them from the &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/02/16/it-is-not-a-school.html&quot;&gt;chaos&lt;/a&gt; around.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Important people don't write code; they attend meetings&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be the Last to Leave the Office&lt;/strong&gt;. Nothing annoys a manager more than an employee who leaves the office at 5 p.m. sharp. It’s a sign of disrespect. Don’t you like it here? Is there anything in this life more important to you than this job? There shouldn’t be. Demonstrate that by staying late. Here is a simple trick: just come later. The boss won’t blame you for that. But always stay there after everybody else is gone. Ideally, you should leave right after the boss. &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/07/21/hourly-pay-modern-slavery.html&quot;&gt;Overtime&lt;/a&gt; is a clear sign of your loyalty to our mutual results.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t Nag&lt;/strong&gt;. No matter what is happening, you should never criticize your direct manager. The boss is &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/01/26/happy-boss-false-objective.html&quot;&gt;always right&lt;/a&gt;. Everything else may be wrong—the situation, colleagues, suppliers, computers, the CEO, investors, the market, or the weather, but not the boss you directly report to. The word of this person is the law. The boss is the god. Ideally, you should be the prophet. No matter what the boss says, you deliver it to others. And you must look like you sincerely believe that it’s right.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Loyalty is what makes you a good slave; don't forget it!&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attend All Meetings&lt;/strong&gt;. No matter what they are about, you must be there. And don’t just be present; actively participate. It’s not so difficult, and very soon you will start to understand what they are talking about and will be able to say something, even if you had no idea about the subject beforehand. Eventually, everybody will start thinking they must ask your permission in order to make some decision, because you were at that meeting. Important people don’t write code; they attend &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/07/13/meetings-are-legalized-robbery.html&quot;&gt;meetings&lt;/a&gt;. Remember that.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Turn Down Recruiters, Publicly&lt;/strong&gt;. Loyalty! That’s what matters to a real team. When a recruiter calls you, raise your voice and explain that you’re happy in this company and don’t want to move on, ever. The more people who hear you, the better. Also, you can sometimes tell stories about offers you’re getting and how you turn them down. Your boss should be the main audience for these stories. Why do you turn them down? Not because they are bad, but because your life belongs to this company. Loyalty is what makes you a &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/07/21/hourly-pay-modern-slavery.html&quot;&gt;good slave&lt;/a&gt;; don’t forget it!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t Take Sides&lt;/strong&gt;. It’s just too risky. In any argument, you can always find pros and cons for both sides, right? So why support one of them? You may be wrong and lose respect in front of everybody. Why take that chance? Instead, always say that there are drawbacks to both options. That’s what a wise man would say, anyway. There is no absolute truth in this world. That’s why you should always stay in the middle, where you will never be wrong. Well, until your boss takes one of the sides. That’s the right moment to agree and follow.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Never Ask for a Raise&lt;/strong&gt;. It should be absolutely clear to everybody that you don’t work for money. You work for &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/03/02/team-morale-myths-and-reality.html&quot;&gt;the big idea&lt;/a&gt;. Period.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attend All Social Events&lt;/strong&gt;. Birthdays, corporate parties, Halloween, Friday beers—you must be there, always. Don’t worry about wasting your life; you will like them eventually. It is very important to demonstrate that you truly live in the office. You are not just writing code, taking money, and going home to your family. Absolutely not! The office is your real family, and you truly enjoy eating pizza with your boss and listening to his childhood stories. That’s how you demonstrate your loyalty, which is the best quality of a &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/07/21/hourly-pay-modern-slavery.html&quot;&gt;good slave&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Point Fingers Privately&lt;/strong&gt;. Don’t say anything bad about anyone in public. No matter who is doing what, we’re always a team; we’re together. Together! This should be your main keyword when talking about results, problems, and risks. Never blame anyone—publicly. However, when you’re talking in the kitchen with a few of your most trusted colleagues, let yourself go. Tell them who you think is the weakest part of the team and what you would do with him or her if you were the boss. Don’t restrict yourself, but always make sure there are only a few people who can hear you.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Added 8-Oct-2015:&lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Never Ask for Vacation&lt;/strong&gt;. When the time is right, your boss will inform you that you can go on vacation. He is the one who knows when it is suitable for the company to have you away for a few days. It can’t be in the middle of a project obviously, nor in the beginning, and definitely not near the end of it. It is usually matched with popular vacation periods in a year (e.g. Christmas, New Year). That might be a bit more expensive for you, but reward of not betraying the company is priceless. If you do make a mistake of asking for a vacation, try to make it short. The worst thing you can do while trying to extend vacation days is to mention that you could “still work while out of the office”—that will immediately get you in a position where you don’t need the office, hence the office doesn’t need you.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Added 30-Jun-2016:&lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;CC Your Boss&lt;/strong&gt;. Add your boss in a CC for as many emails as possible. The more &lt;a href=&quot;/2017/04/18/no-help-via-email.html&quot;&gt;emails&lt;/a&gt; that come from you, the more valuable you are. Your boss must see that you’re actively involved in many communications and that it’s simply impossible to replace you. Besides that, CC-ing the boss is a sign of respect. She or he will never forget that.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sigh, Don’t Laugh&lt;/strong&gt;. You must look very concerned about situations regarding the project, the team, the management, the office space, and everyone’s future. If you’re not concerned and laugh about it, how can you be trusted? That’s a clear sign that you’re not taking your job seriously, and who knows what you will do tomorrow. Don’t be like that. Instead, always look a bit sad. God forbid you look happy in front of the boss.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Care About Everything&lt;/strong&gt;. No matter what the discussion is about, you care about the subject. There is nothing involving the team that doesn’t bother you. You must show that you feel responsible for every problem and each task. Also, when there is a discussion in the office and someone is doing his own thing, paying no attention to the subject, you should ask, “Doesn’t this concern you at all?” Make him feel guilty for not being careful enough—that will give you a lot of points for “being on top of all things.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Look Tired&lt;/strong&gt;. Always look a bit tired, as if you were working all night and barely got a few hours of sleep. Also, try to make it obvious that you were fixing some old bug in the system that nobody except you really cares about. You must not look too energetic—this disrespects your boss. He didn’t give you enough work to wear you out completely? That means he is a bad manager. Instead, you should even joke that “our boss knows how to keep us busy.” That flattery will definitely please even a smart person.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Added 13-Aug-2017:&lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Have No Hobbies&lt;/strong&gt;. It’s very annoying to see you enjoying something else aside from the job in the office. Your happiness and your heart must be here, at the work desk. Not somewhere else, at a snow slope or a tennis court. Sport, dancing, singing, gaming, painting, even open sourcing—are the activities you must hide. You are betraying your boss and your company if anything aside from the project is making you happy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;hr /&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you follow all these rules, you won’t be fired, ever. Well, until the company is bankrupt, that is. If it’s a startup, it will go bankrupt for sure, thanks to you and people like you. If it’s a big enterprise, it probably won’t, unfortunately. You will be safe, and your &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/03/08/pimp-up-your-resume.html&quot;&gt;resume&lt;/a&gt; will have an &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/10/29/how-much-do-you-cost.html&quot;&gt;impressive&lt;/a&gt; “12 years at Oracle” statement. Well, that’s an achievement, isn’t it?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I don’t think so.&lt;/p&gt; " /> <meta name="keywords" content="next, path, output, content, previous, url, relative_path, id, collection, excerpt, draft, categories, layout, title, date, place, tags, description, keywords, related, social, image, jb_picture, slug, ext" /> <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1"/> <meta name="google-site-verification" content="JEj_gQr2CPe2QKGw8XdMz0R7VboQIUbX3FlM-lwTq-8" /> <meta name="author" content="Yegor Bugayenko"> <meta name="article:published_time" content="2015-10-06 00:00:00 +0000"> <meta name="og:site_name" content="Yegor Bugayenko"/> <meta name="og:type" content="article" /> <meta name="og:locale" content="en_US" /> <meta name="twitter:account_id" content="4503599630178231" /> <meta name="twitter:creator" content="@yegor256"/> <meta name="twitter:site" content="@yegor256"/> <meta name="twitter:title" property="og:title" content="How to Be a Good Office Slave"/> <meta name="twitter:description" property="og:description" content="&lt;p&gt;This is a short manual for you, my friend.

The word of this person is the law. The boss is the god. Ideally, you should be the prophet. No matter what the boss says, you deliver it to others. And you must look like you sincerely believe that it’s right.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Loyalty is what makes you a good slave; don't forget it!&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attend All Meetings&lt;/strong&gt;. No matter what they are about, you must be there. And don’t just be present; actively participate. It’s not so difficult, and very soon you will start to understand what they are talking about and will be able to say something, even if you had no idea about the subject beforehand. Eventually, everybody will start thinking they must ask your permission in order to make some decision, because you were at that meeting. Important people don’t write code; they attend &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/07/13/meetings-are-legalized-robbery.html&quot;&gt;meetings&lt;/a&gt;. Remember that.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Turn Down Recruiters, Publicly&lt;/strong&gt;. Loyalty! That’s what matters to a real team. When a recruiter calls you, raise your voice and explain that you’re happy in this company and don’t want to move on, ever. The more people who hear you, the better. Also, you can sometimes tell stories about offers you’re getting and how you turn them down. Your boss should be the main audience for these stories. Why do you turn them down? Not because they are bad, but because your life belongs to this company. Loyalty is what makes you a &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/07/21/hourly-pay-modern-slavery.html&quot;&gt;good slave&lt;/a&gt;; don’t forget it!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t Take Sides&lt;/strong&gt;. It’s just too risky. In any argument, you can always find pros and cons for both sides, right? So why support one of them? You may be wrong and lose respect in front of everybody. Why take that chance? Instead, always say that there are drawbacks to both options. That’s what a wise man would say, anyway. There is no absolute truth in this world. That’s why you should always stay in the middle, where you will never be wrong. Well, until your boss takes one of the sides. That’s the right moment to agree and follow.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Never Ask for a Raise&lt;/strong&gt;. It should be absolutely clear to everybody that you don’t work for money. You work for &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/03/02/team-morale-myths-and-reality.html&quot;&gt;the big idea&lt;/a&gt;. Period.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attend All Social Events&lt;/strong&gt;. Birthdays, corporate parties, Halloween, Friday beers—you must be there, always. Don’t worry about wasting your life; you will like them eventually. It is very important to demonstrate that you truly live in the office. You are not just writing code, taking money, and going home to your family. Absolutely not! The office is your real family, and you truly enjoy eating pizza with your boss and listening to his childhood stories. That’s how you demonstrate your loyalty, which is the best quality of a &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/07/21/hourly-pay-modern-slavery.html&quot;&gt;good slave&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Point Fingers Privately&lt;/strong&gt;. Don’t say anything bad about anyone in public. No matter who is doing what, we’re always a team; we’re together. Together! This should be your main keyword when talking about results, problems, and risks. Never blame anyone—publicly. However, when you’re talking in the kitchen with a few of your most trusted colleagues, let yourself go. Tell them who you think is the weakest part of the team and what you would do with him or her if you were the boss. Don’t restrict yourself, but always make sure there are only a few people who can hear you.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Added 8-Oct-2015:&lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Never Ask for Vacation&lt;/strong&gt;. When the time is right, your boss will inform you that you can go on vacation. He is the one who knows when it is suitable for the company to have you away for a few days. It can’t be in the middle of a project obviously, nor in the beginning, and definitely not near the end of it. It is usually matched with popular vacation periods in a year (e.g. Christmas, New Year). That might be a bit more expensive for you, but reward of not betraying the company is priceless. If you do make a mistake of asking for a vacation, try to make it short. The worst thing you can do while trying to extend vacation days is to mention that you could “still work while out of the office”—that will immediately get you in a position where you don’t need the office, hence the office doesn’t need you.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Added 30-Jun-2016:&lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;CC Your Boss&lt;/strong&gt;. Add your boss in a CC for as many emails as possible. The more &lt;a href=&quot;/2017/04/18/no-help-via-email.html&quot;&gt;emails&lt;/a&gt; that come from you, the more valuable you are. Your boss must see that you’re actively involved in many communications and that it’s simply impossible to replace you. Besides that, CC-ing the boss is a sign of respect. She or he will never forget that.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sigh, Don’t Laugh&lt;/strong&gt;. You must look very concerned about situations regarding the project, the team, the management, the office space, and everyone’s future. If you’re not concerned and laugh about it, how can you be trusted? That’s a clear sign that you’re not taking your job seriously, and who knows what you will do tomorrow. Don’t be like that. Instead, always look a bit sad. God forbid you look happy in front of the boss.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Care About Everything&lt;/strong&gt;. No matter what the discussion is about, you care about the subject. There is nothing involving the team that doesn’t bother you. You must show that you feel responsible for every problem and each task. Also, when there is a discussion in the office and someone is doing his own thing, paying no attention to the subject, you should ask, “Doesn’t this concern you at all?” Make him feel guilty for not being careful enough—that will give you a lot of points for “being on top of all things.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Look Tired&lt;/strong&gt;. Always look a bit tired, as if you were working all night and barely got a few hours of sleep. Also, try to make it obvious that you were fixing some old bug in the system that nobody except you really cares about. You must not look too energetic—this disrespects your boss. He didn’t give you enough work to wear you out completely? That means he is a bad manager. Instead, you should even joke that “our boss knows how to keep us busy.” That flattery will definitely please even a smart person.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Added 13-Aug-2017:&lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Have No Hobbies&lt;/strong&gt;. It’s very annoying to see you enjoying something else aside from the job in the office. Your happiness and your heart must be here, at the work desk. Not somewhere else, at a snow slope or a tennis court. Sport, dancing, singing, gaming, painting, even open sourcing—are the activities you must hide. You are betraying your boss and your company if anything aside from the project is making you happy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;hr /&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you follow all these rules, you won’t be fired, ever. Well, until the company is bankrupt, that is. If it’s a startup, it will go bankrupt for sure, thanks to you and people like you. If it’s a big enterprise, it probably won’t, unfortunately. You will be safe, and your &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/03/08/pimp-up-your-resume.html&quot;&gt;resume&lt;/a&gt; will have an &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/10/29/how-much-do-you-cost.html&quot;&gt;impressive&lt;/a&gt; “12 years at Oracle” statement. Well, that’s an achievement, isn’t it?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I don’t think so.&lt;/p&gt; "/> <meta name="twitter:url" property="og:url"

I assume you are sitting in the office right now, reading this blog post. Maybe you don’t like your office job, or maybe you enjoy it and feel excited to be close to your office friends. It doesn’t matter. What matters is that there is always an alternative to office slavery. I’m not talking about starting your own business. There are people in this world who work for someone without doing what is described below. They do exist, as well as companies that don’t turn their employees into slaves. I really hope you will eventually find one. In the meantime, this manual is for you :)</p><figure class="jb_picture"><img itemprop="image" alt="The Office (2001–2003)" src="/images/2015/10/the-office.jpg" longdesc="#1003bba1" /><figcaption id="1003bba1">The Office (2001–2003)</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Help Others</strong>. Find the stupidest newbies and help them. Regardless of what exactly you help them with, they should rely on you. Show them where the restroom is, recommend a good restaurant nearby, assist in an IDE installation, explain how the project works, and make standard jokes about the worst class in it. They must become your best friends—and not only them. Be helpful to everybody. No matter what is happening, everyone must know that you’re ready to help. Ideally, they all must depend on your kindness and readiness to save them from the <a href="/2015/02/16/it-is-not-a-school.html">chaos</a> around.</p><aside class="quote">Important people don't write code; they attend meetings</aside><p><strong>Be the Last to Leave the Office</strong>. Nothing annoys a manager more than an employee who leaves the office at 5 p.m. sharp. It’s a sign of disrespect. Don’t you like it here? Is there anything in this life more important to you than this job? There shouldn’t be. Demonstrate that by staying late. Here is a simple trick: just come later. The boss won’t blame you for that. But always stay there after everybody else is gone. Ideally, you should leave right after the boss. <a href="/2015/07/21/hourly-pay-modern-slavery.html">Overtime</a> is a clear sign of your loyalty to our mutual results.</p><p><strong>Don’t Nag</strong>. No matter what is happening, you should never criticize your direct manager. The boss is <a href="/2015/01/26/happy-boss-false-objective.html">always right</a>. Everything else may be wrong—the situation, colleagues, suppliers, computers, the CEO, investors, the market, or the weather, but not the boss you directly report to.

I assume you are sitting in the office right now, reading this blog post. Maybe you don’t like your office job, or maybe you enjoy it and feel excited to be close to your office friends. It doesn’t matter. What matters is that there is always an alternative to office slavery. I’m not talking about starting your own business. There are people in this world who work for someone without doing what is described below. They do exist, as well as companies that don’t turn their employees into slaves. I really hope you will eventually find one. In the meantime, this manual is for you :)</p><figure class="jb_picture"><img itemprop="image" alt="The Office (2001–2003)" src="/images/2015/10/the-office.jpg" longdesc="#1003bba1" /><figcaption id="1003bba1">The Office (2001–2003)</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Help Others</strong>. Find the stupidest newbies and help them. Regardless of what exactly you help them with, they should rely on you. Show them where the restroom is, recommend a good restaurant nearby, assist in an IDE installation, explain how the project works, and make standard jokes about the worst class in it. They must become your best friends—and not only them. Be helpful to everybody. No matter what is happening, everyone must know that you’re ready to help. Ideally, they all must depend on your kindness and readiness to save them from the <a href="/2015/02/16/it-is-not-a-school.html">chaos</a> around.</p><aside class="quote">Important people don't write code; they attend meetings</aside><p><strong>Be the Last to Leave the Office</strong>. Nothing annoys a manager more than an employee who leaves the office at 5 p.m. sharp. It’s a sign of disrespect. Don’t you like it here? Is there anything in this life more important to you than this job? There shouldn’t be. Demonstrate that by staying late. Here is a simple trick: just come later. The boss won’t blame you for that. But always stay there after everybody else is gone. Ideally, you should leave right after the boss. <a href="/2015/07/21/hourly-pay-modern-slavery.html">Overtime</a> is a clear sign of your loyalty to our mutual results.</p><p><strong>Don’t Nag</strong>. No matter what is happening, you should never criticize your direct manager. The boss is <a href="/2015/01/26/happy-boss-false-objective.html">always right</a>. Everything else may be wrong—the situation, colleagues, suppliers, computers, the CEO, investors, the market, or the weather, but not the boss you directly report to. The word of this person is the law. The boss is the god. Ideally, you should be the prophet. No matter what the boss says, you deliver it to others. And you must look like you sincerely believe that it’s right.</p><aside class="quote">Loyalty is what makes you a good slave; don't forget it!</aside><p><strong>Attend All Meetings</strong>. No matter what they are about, you must be there. And don’t just be present; actively participate. It’s not so difficult, and very soon you will start to understand what they are talking about and will be able to say something, even if you had no idea about the subject beforehand. Eventually, everybody will start thinking they must ask your permission in order to make some decision, because you were at that meeting. Important people don’t write code; they attend <a href="/2015/07/13/meetings-are-legalized-robbery.html">meetings</a>. Remember that.</p><p><strong>Turn Down Recruiters, Publicly</strong>. Loyalty! That’s what matters to a real team. When a recruiter calls you, raise your voice and explain that you’re happy in this company and don’t want to move on, ever. The more people who hear you, the better. Also, you can sometimes tell stories about offers you’re getting and how you turn them down. Your boss should be the main audience for these stories. Why do you turn them down? Not because they are bad, but because your life belongs to this company. Loyalty is what makes you a <a href="/2015/07/21/hourly-pay-modern-slavery.html">good slave</a>; don’t forget it!</p><p><strong>Don’t Take Sides</strong>. It’s just too risky. In any argument, you can always find pros and cons for both sides, right? So why support one of them? You may be wrong and lose respect in front of everybody. Why take that chance? Instead, always say that there are drawbacks to both options. That’s what a wise man would say, anyway. There is no absolute truth in this world. That’s why you should always stay in the middle, where you will never be wrong. Well, until your boss takes one of the sides. That’s the right moment to agree and follow.</p><p><strong>Never Ask for a Raise</strong>. It should be absolutely clear to everybody that you don’t work for money. You work for <a href="/2015/03/02/team-morale-myths-and-reality.html">the big idea</a>. Period.</p><p><strong>Attend All Social Events</strong>. Birthdays, corporate parties, Halloween, Friday beers—you must be there, always. Don’t worry about wasting your life; you will like them eventually. It is very important to demonstrate that you truly live in the office. You are not just writing code, taking money, and going home to your family. Absolutely not! The office is your real family, and you truly enjoy eating pizza with your boss and listening to his childhood stories. That’s how you demonstrate your loyalty, which is the best quality of a <a href="/2015/07/21/hourly-pay-modern-slavery.html">good slave</a>.</p><p><strong>Point Fingers Privately</strong>. Don’t say anything bad about anyone in public. No matter who is doing what, we’re always a team; we’re together. Together! This should be your main keyword when talking about results, problems, and risks. Never blame anyone—publicly. However, when you’re talking in the kitchen with a few of your most trusted colleagues, let yourself go. Tell them who you think is the weakest part of the team and what you would do with him or her if you were the boss. Don’t restrict yourself, but always make sure there are only a few people who can hear you.</p><p>Added 8-Oct-2015:<br /> <strong>Never Ask for Vacation</strong>. When the time is right, your boss will inform you that you can go on vacation. He is the one who knows when it is suitable for the company to have you away for a few days. It can’t be in the middle of a project obviously, nor in the beginning, and definitely not near the end of it. It is usually matched with popular vacation periods in a year (e.g. Christmas, New Year). That might be a bit more expensive for you, but reward of not betraying the company is priceless. If you do make a mistake of asking for a vacation, try to make it short. The worst thing you can do while trying to extend vacation days is to mention that you could “still work while out of the office”—that will immediately get you in a position where you don’t need the office, hence the office doesn’t need you.</p><p>Added 30-Jun-2016:<br /> <strong>CC Your Boss</strong>. Add your boss in a CC for as many emails as possible. The more <a href="/2017/04/18/no-help-via-email.html">emails</a> that come from you, the more valuable you are. Your boss must see that you’re actively involved in many communications and that it’s simply impossible to replace you. Besides that, CC-ing the boss is a sign of respect. She or he will never forget that.</p><p><strong>Sigh, Don’t Laugh</strong>. You must look very concerned about situations regarding the project, the team, the management, the office space, and everyone’s future. If you’re not concerned and laugh about it, how can you be trusted? That’s a clear sign that you’re not taking your job seriously, and who knows what you will do tomorrow. Don’t be like that. Instead, always look a bit sad. God forbid you look happy in front of the boss.</p><p><strong>Care About Everything</strong>. No matter what the discussion is about, you care about the subject. There is nothing involving the team that doesn’t bother you. You must show that you feel responsible for every problem and each task. Also, when there is a discussion in the office and someone is doing his own thing, paying no attention to the subject, you should ask, “Doesn’t this concern you at all?” Make him feel guilty for not being careful enough—that will give you a lot of points for “being on top of all things.”</p><p><strong>Look Tired</strong>. Always look a bit tired, as if you were working all night and barely got a few hours of sleep. Also, try to make it obvious that you were fixing some old bug in the system that nobody except you really cares about. You must not look too energetic—this disrespects your boss. He didn’t give you enough work to wear you out completely? That means he is a bad manager. Instead, you should even joke that “our boss knows how to keep us busy.” That flattery will definitely please even a smart person.</p><p>Added 13-Aug-2017:<br /> <strong>Have No Hobbies</strong>. It’s very annoying to see you enjoying something else aside from the job in the office. Your happiness and your heart must be here, at the work desk. Not somewhere else, at a snow slope or a tennis court. Sport, dancing, singing, gaming, painting, even open sourcing—are the activities you must hide. You are betraying your boss and your company if anything aside from the project is making you happy.</p><hr /><p>If you follow all these rules, you won’t be fired, ever.
