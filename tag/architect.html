Architect?"/> <meta name="twitter:description" property="og:description" content="&lt;p&gt;Over twenty five years ago, in 1992, at an OOPSLA workshop in Vancouver, Kent Beck, in answer to the question “What is an architect?” said, according to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0164121208002057&quot;&gt;Philippe Kruchten&lt;/a&gt;, that it is “a new pompous title that programmers demand to have on their business cards to justify their sumptuous emoluments.” Not much has changed since then. There is a big difference between a smart programmer and a project architect. Here is a list of traits that, I believe, a good architect has.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;!--more--&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;jb_picture&quot;&gt;&lt;img itemprop=&quot;image&quot; alt=&quot;No Country for Old Men (2007) by Coen Brothers&quot; src=&quot;/images/2018/06/no-country-for-old-men.jpg&quot; longdesc=&quot;#3627e4f5&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption id=&quot;3627e4f5&quot;&gt;No Country for Old Men (2007) by Coen Brothers&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Disclaimer: Even though I haven’t seen a single female software architect in my life, I have to say for my leftist/feminist readers that in this blog post I’m assuming an architect is a man only for the sake of convenience of speech. There is no intention to offend anyone.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;He Is Loyal.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Programmers come and go. They are, as I &lt;a href=&quot;/2018/01/09/micro-budgeting.html&quot;&gt;mentioned&lt;/a&gt; many times before, egoists with a strong focus on their personal profit. They change projects, they work on multiple projects at the same time, they have &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/10/26/hacker-vs-programmer-mentality.html&quot;&gt;no personal attachments&lt;/a&gt; to any piece of code. They worry only about their individual tasks and feature branches. The branch is merged? All bets are off. Professional developers are “polygamous” and disloyal.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;An architect, however, is a different creature. He stays with the project even after it runs out of funds, loses the last programmer, and proves that the architecture is a total mess that can’t handle even a fraction of the traffic it was supposed to work under. The architect stays and says “No worries, we’ll get through, no matter what!” How to find such a guy and how to motivate him are different questions, maybe for another blog post.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;He Is Disciplined.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Design patterns, quality of code, static analysis, unit testing, high performance, reliability, security and even maintainability are all very important things to worry about. However, a good architect knows that all these can be resolved and achieved by programmers, if they are properly hired, motivated, organized and controlled. How to hire, motivate, organize and control them—that’s what a good architect worries about.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He knows that process comes first, people next.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;An architect puts discipline on top of everything else, constantly inventing new rules and enforcing them.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, this is not what most software experts think. For example, according to Alistair Cockburn’s article &lt;a href=&quot;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/963450/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Agile Software Development: The People Factor&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; published in IEEE Computer in 2001: “If the people on the project are good enough, they can use almost any process and accomplish their assignment. If they are not good enough, no process will repair their inadequacy—‘people trump process’ is one way to say this.” It is acceptable if a programmer thinks like that, but not an architect.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;An architect puts discipline on top of everything else, constantly inventing new &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/10/13/competition-without-rules.html&quot;&gt;rules&lt;/a&gt; and enforcing them. Moreover, he is not only making others obey, but also following the rules himself. Here, for example, are the rules to enforce:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;No changes without a code review;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Every idea starts with a ticket;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;The master branch is &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/07/21/read-only-master-branch.html&quot;&gt;read only&lt;/a&gt;;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Static analysis is &lt;a href=&quot;/2018/01/16/educational-aspect-of-static-analysis.html&quot;&gt;mandatory&lt;/a&gt;;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;No &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/06/27/singletons-must-die.html&quot;&gt;singletons&lt;/a&gt;, no &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/09/16/getters-and-setters-are-evil.html&quot;&gt;getter/setters&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/02/03/design-patterns-and-anti-patterns.html&quot;&gt;so on&lt;/a&gt;;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Unit testing is mandatory for all new changes;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;No &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/10/07/stop-chatting-start-coding.html&quot;&gt;informal discussions&lt;/a&gt; outside of tickets.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Each project has its own set of rules. The list above is a subset of what we have on our projects at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zerocracy.com&quot;&gt;Zerocracy&lt;/a&gt;. A good architect thinks about the rules first and about the architecture second.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I totally agree with Len Bass that “the architecture should be the product of a single architect,” as he said in his book &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2MvHgFY&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Software Architecture in Practice&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The question, however, is how exactly the architect will create the product: either in solo mode, making all technical decisions alone, or letting the team contribute in an organized and disciplined manner. The former is easy but less effective, the latter is way more difficult, but leads to much stronger solutions and better team synergy (I hate this word, but here it fits well).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;He Is Strong.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Matthew McBride said in his article &lt;a href=&quot;https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2007/5/5663-the-software-architect/abstract&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Software Architect&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, published in CACM in 2007, that “Without strong supervision from the software architect, projects and attempted solutions tend to fall apart due to the weight of unmitigated complexity.” The word &lt;em&gt;strong&lt;/em&gt; is what is important to emphasize here.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;The strength of an architect is in the ability to say &quot;No&quot; when it's difficult to do so.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;What does strength mean in this context? An ability to stay in the office two days straight with just pizza and cola? An ability to multiply six-digit numbers in memory? An ability to memorize the purpose and design of all classes and methods? An ability to stay in a meeting with investors for three hours without checking Facebook even once? Not likely.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The strength of an architect is in the ability to say “No” when it’s difficult to do so. For example:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;“No, I will &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/02/09/serious-code-reviewer.html&quot;&gt;not merge&lt;/a&gt; your pull request”;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;“No, we will not implement this feature”;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;“No, you do not deserve a promotion yet”;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;“No, your code is not as good as we expect”;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;“No, this build is not stable enough to be released”;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;“No, you will not go on vacation this month.”&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are many other instances of “No” which can easily turn an architect into a hated figure, but this is what his job is: to be the bad guy. This is why he has to be strong—to handle it all calmly and continue leading the project forward, toward his own well-defined technical goals.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;He Is Abstract.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Abstract thinking is a very important positive trait of an architect. Programmers may lack that, since they are mostly focused on their own &lt;a href=&quot;/2017/11/28/microtasking.html&quot;&gt;isolated tasks&lt;/a&gt;. An architect must think globally and see the product as a whole. Details are less important. He must rely on his people when talking about details.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;He Is Social.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Software is a product of people. No matter how great the architect is, if he can’t find the right people to implement his ideas and to bring back new ideas, he is doomed to fail. The key quality of the architect is the ability to work with people: recruit, motivate, and control their results. &lt;a href=&quot;/2018/01/23/sociotech-skills.html&quot;&gt;Social skills&lt;/a&gt; are what an architect needs in order to be successful in that, especially in finding new programmers and engaging them on the project. What exactly does this mean? Well, here are some examples:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;High visibility in social networks;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;A long list of previous projects and teams;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Active membership in professional groups;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Publicity in the blogosphere.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;In other words, a good architect is the one with a big group of followers and supporters around him. I mentioned that in my recent talk &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GS45LzE3LPQ&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;How Much Do You Cost?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=&quot;http://jeeconf.com/speaker/yegor-bugayenko-2/&quot;&gt;JEEConf 2017&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;He Is Brave.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A good architect says many times a day: “It is my fault.” If an architect doesn’t have a habit of saying that frequently, he is not a good architect. He is just a programmer who is afraid of responsibility and authority.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The golden rule of a good manager is: “Success is yours, faults are mine.” This is the attitude a good architect has to express to his team. When they win, he will always find a way to celebrate and reward them. When they fail, he will take full responsibility for the failure. Because it’s his team, he found them, he motivated them, he controlled them, and he didn’t punish them properly. That’s why they failed. First of all, it’s his fault.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;He didn't punish them properly. That's why they failed. First of all, it's his fault.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;What will he do with this fault is a separate question. Maybe he will train and coach someone, maybe he’ll enforce some rules more aggressively, maybe he will even &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/09/16/how-to-fire-someone-right.html&quot;&gt;give someone his card&lt;/a&gt;. It’s up to the architect. But for the outside world he will always be the guilty one and the team must know that. If they know that, they will do everything to not let the architect down.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;He Is Simple.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Simplicity is a great virtue,” said Edsger Dijkstra in 1984. For a programmer it’s a virtue, for an architect it’s a survival skill. An architect who can’t explain his ideas in simple words, easily understood by other programmers, is not an architect. No matter how smart he is, no matter how bright his ideas are. If they can’t be delivered in a simple form, they are worth nothing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“If I don’t understand you, it’s your fault” &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/06/29/simple-diagrams.html&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; Yegor Bugayenko in 2015. A good architect remembers that.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;He Is Coding.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Anthony Langsworth in his piece &lt;a href=&quot;https://goo.gl/vGN61n&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Should Software Architects Write Code?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; argues in favor of code-writing architects and in particular says that “Understanding code means the architect can use his or her judgment more effectively rather than rely on which developer is more persuasive.” Indeed, an architect that is only capable of talking and &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/06/29/simple-diagrams.html&quot;&gt;drawing&lt;/a&gt; is a weak architect that will sooner or later let the team and the project down.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;How much code the architect has to write, depends on the age of the project. When the project is young and is still in the phase of prototyping, the architect produces the &lt;a href=&quot;/2017/03/24/tdd-that-works.html&quot;&gt;majority of code&lt;/a&gt;. Then, later, when the product matures, the architect steps away and mostly reviews the contribution of programmers. Eventually, when the project migrates into the maintenance phase, the architect may quit the project and transfer his responsibilities to one of the programmers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;He Is Ambitious.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;An architect does want to get something in addition to money. He wants to be the smartest guy in the room, he wants to solve complex tasks nobody else has been able to solve before, he wants to save the world. He wants all of that to be appreciated and rewarded. He wants to be number one. In most cases he fails miserably. But he always gets back on his feet and tries again. Look for the guy with ambitions if you want to hire an architect, not just yet another programmer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;An architect wants to be a man of power, not just a smart technical engineer.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;Michael Keeling, in his recent book &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2tgR8uv&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Design It!: From Programmer to Software Architect&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (worth reading), says: “On some teams, architect is an official team role. On other teams, there is no explicit role and teammates share the architect’s responsibilities. Some teams say they don’t have an architect, but if you look closely, someone is fulfilling the architect’s duties without realizing it. If your team doesn’t have an architect, congratulations, you’ve got the job!”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Michael’s point is that the architect’s position is rarely given to someone voluntarily. Instead, an architect has to fight for it and demand it. Sometimes even going straight ahead and saying “I want to be the architect!”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What is important is that it will not sound like “I want to architect this.” That would be the voice of a programmer, not an architect. An architect wants to be a man of power, not just a smart technical engineer. So, it’s way more about a title for him, rather that just his actual responsibilities.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;He Is Expensive&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Yes, the money question &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/10/29/how-much-do-you-cost.html&quot;&gt;again&lt;/a&gt;. A good architect is expensive. If he is not, he is not a good architect.&lt;/p&gt; "/> <meta name="twitter:url" property="og:url" content="https://www.yegor256.com/2018/06/26/are-you-an-architect.html"/> <meta

years ago, in 1992, at an OOPSLA workshop in Vancouver, Kent Beck, in answer to the question “What is an architect?” said, according to <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0164121208002057">Philippe Kruchten</a>, that it is “a new pompous title that programmers demand to have on their business cards to justify their sumptuous emoluments.” Not much has changed since then. There is a big difference between a smart programmer and a project architect. Here is a list of traits that, I believe, a good architect has.</p><figure class="jb_picture"><img itemprop="image" alt="No Country for Old Men (2007) by Coen Brothers" src="/images/2018/06/no-country-for-old-men.jpg" longdesc="#3627e4f5" /><figcaption id="3627e4f5">No Country for Old Men (2007) by Coen Brothers</figcaption></figure><p>Disclaimer: Even though I haven’t seen a single female software architect in my life, I have to say for my leftist/feminist readers that in this blog post I’m assuming an architect is a man only for the sake of convenience of speech. There is no intention to offend anyone.</p><p><strong>He Is Loyal.</strong></p><p>Programmers come and go. They are, as I <a href="/2018/01/09/micro-budgeting.html">mentioned</a> many times before, egoists with a strong focus on their personal profit. They change projects, they work on multiple projects at the same time, they have <a href="/2014/10/26/hacker-vs-programmer-mentality.html">no personal attachments</a> to any piece of code. They worry only about their individual tasks and feature branches. The branch is merged? All bets are off. Professional developers are “polygamous” and disloyal.</p><p>An architect, however, is a different creature.

The architect stays and says “No worries, we’ll get through, no matter what!” How to find such a guy and how to motivate him are different questions, maybe for another blog post.</p><p><strong>He Is Disciplined.</strong></p><p>Design patterns, quality of code, static analysis, unit testing, high performance, reliability, security and even maintainability are all very important things to worry about. However, a good architect knows that all these can be resolved and achieved by programmers, if they are properly hired, motivated, organized and controlled. How to hire, motivate, organize and control them—that’s what a good architect worries about.</p><p>He knows that process comes first, people next.</p><aside class="quote">An architect puts discipline on top of everything else, constantly inventing new rules and enforcing them.</aside><p>However, this is not what most software experts think. For example, according to Alistair Cockburn’s article <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/963450/"><em>Agile Software Development: The People Factor</em></a> published in IEEE Computer in 2001: “If the people on the project are good enough, they can use almost any process and accomplish their assignment. If they are not good enough, no process will repair their inadequacy—‘people trump process’ is one way to say this.” It is acceptable if a programmer thinks like that, but not an architect.</p><p>An architect puts discipline on top of everything else, constantly inventing new <a href="/2015/10/13/competition-without-rules.html">rules</a> and enforcing them. Moreover, he is not only making others obey, but also following the rules himself. Here, for example, are the rules to enforce:</p><ul> <li>No changes without a code review;</li> <li>Every idea starts with a ticket;</li> <li>The master branch is <a href="/2014/07/21/read-only-master-branch.html">read only</a>;</li> <li>Static analysis is <a href="/2018/01/16/educational-aspect-of-static-analysis.html">mandatory</a>;</li> <li>No <a href="/2016/06/27/singletons-must-die.html">singletons</a>, no <a href="/2014/09/16/getters-and-setters-are-evil.html">getter/setters</a>, and <a href="/2016/02/03/design-patterns-and-anti-patterns.html">so on</a>;</li> <li>Unit testing is mandatory for all new changes;</li> <li>No <a href="/2014/10/07/stop-chatting-start-coding.html">informal discussions</a> outside of tickets.</li></ul><p>Each project has its own set of rules. The list above is a subset of what we have on our projects at <a href="https://www.zerocracy.com">Zerocracy</a>. A good architect thinks about the rules first and about the architecture second.</p><p>I totally agree with Len Bass that “the architecture should be the product of a single architect,” as he said in his book <a href="https://amzn.to/2MvHgFY"><em>Software Architecture in Practice</em></a>. The question, however, is how exactly the architect will create the product: either in solo mode, making all technical decisions alone, or letting the team contribute in an organized and disciplined manner. The former is easy but less effective, the latter is way more difficult, but leads to much stronger solutions and better team synergy (I hate this word, but here it fits well).</p><p><strong>He Is Strong.</strong></p><p>Matthew McBride said in his article <a href="https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2007/5/5663-the-software-architect/abstract"><em>The Software Architect</em></a>, published in CACM in 2007, that “Without strong supervision from the software architect, projects and attempted solutions tend to fall apart due to the weight of unmitigated complexity.” The word <em>strong</em> is what is important to emphasize here.</p><aside class="quote">The strength of an architect is in the ability to say "No" when it's difficult to do so.</aside><p>What does strength mean in this context? An ability to stay in the office two days straight with just pizza and cola? An ability to multiply six-digit numbers in memory? An ability to memorize the purpose and design of all classes and methods? An ability to stay in a meeting with investors for three hours without checking Facebook even once? Not likely.</p><p>The strength of an architect is in the ability to say “No” when it’s difficult to do so. For example:</p><ul> <li>“No, I will <a href="/2015/02/09/serious-code-reviewer.html">not merge</a> your pull request”;</li> <li>“No, we will not implement this feature”;</li> <li>“No, you do not deserve a promotion yet”;</li> <li>“No, your code is not as good as we expect”;</li> <li>“No, this build is not stable enough to be released”;</li> <li>“No, you will not go on vacation this month.”</li></ul><p>There are many other instances of “No” which can easily turn an architect into a hated figure, but this is what his job is: to be the bad guy. This is why he has to be strong—to handle it all calmly and continue leading the project forward, toward his own well-defined technical goals.</p><p><strong>He Is Abstract.</strong></p><p>Abstract thinking is a very important positive trait of an architect. Programmers may lack that, since they are mostly focused on their own <a href="/2017/11/28/microtasking.html">isolated tasks</a>. An architect must think globally and see the product as a whole. Details are less important. He must rely on his people when talking about details.</p><p><strong>He Is Social.</strong></p><p>Software is a product of people. No matter how great the architect is, if he can’t find the right people to implement his ideas and to bring back new ideas, he is doomed to fail. The key quality of the architect is the ability to work with people: recruit, motivate, and control their results. <a href="/2018/01/23/sociotech-skills.html">Social skills</a> are what an architect needs in order to be successful in that, especially in finding new programmers and engaging them on the project. What exactly does this mean? Well, here are some examples:</p><ul> <li>High visibility in social networks;</li> <li>A long list of previous projects and teams;</li> <li>Active membership in professional groups;</li> <li>Publicity in the blogosphere.</li></ul><p>In other words, a good architect is the one with a big group of followers and supporters around him. I mentioned that in my recent talk <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GS45LzE3LPQ"><em>How Much Do You Cost?</em></a> at <a href="http://jeeconf.com/speaker/yegor-bugayenko-2/">JEEConf 2017</a>.</p><p><strong>He Is Brave.</strong></p><p>A good architect says many times a day: “It is my fault.” If an architect doesn’t have a habit of saying that frequently, he is not a good architect. He is just a programmer who is afraid of responsibility and authority.</p><p>The golden rule of a good manager is: “Success is yours, faults are mine.” This is the attitude a good architect has to express to his team. When they win, he will always find a way to celebrate and reward them. When they fail, he will take full responsibility for the failure. Because it’s his team, he found them, he motivated them, he controlled them, and he didn’t punish them properly. That’s why they failed. First of all, it’s his fault.</p><aside class="quote">He didn't punish them properly. That's why they failed. First of all, it's his fault.</aside><p>What will he do with this fault is a separate question. Maybe he will train and coach someone, maybe he’ll enforce some rules more aggressively, maybe he will even <a href="/2015/09/16/how-to-fire-someone-right.html">give someone his card</a>. It’s up to the architect. But for the outside world he will always be the guilty one and the team must know that. If they know that, they will do everything to not let the architect down.</p><p><strong>He Is Simple.</strong></p><p>“Simplicity is a great virtue,” said Edsger Dijkstra in 1984. For a programmer it’s a virtue, for an architect it’s a survival skill. An architect who can’t explain his ideas in simple words, easily understood by other programmers, is not an architect. No matter how smart he is, no matter how bright his ideas are. If they can’t be delivered in a simple form, they are worth nothing.</p><p>“If I don’t understand you, it’s your fault” <a href="/2015/06/29/simple-diagrams.html">said</a> Yegor Bugayenko in 2015. A good architect remembers that.</p><p><strong>He Is Coding.</strong></p><p>Anthony Langsworth in his piece <a href="https://goo.gl/vGN61n"><em>Should Software Architects Write Code?</em></a> argues in favor of code-writing architects and in particular says that “Understanding code means the architect can use his or her judgment more effectively rather than rely on which developer is more persuasive.” Indeed, an architect that is only capable of talking and <a href="/2015/06/29/simple-diagrams.html">drawing</a> is a weak architect that will sooner or later let the team and the project down.</p><p>How much code the architect has to write, depends on the age of the project. When the project is young and is still in the phase of prototyping, the architect produces the <a href="/2017/03/24/tdd-that-works.html">majority of code</a>. Then, later, when the product matures, the architect steps away and mostly reviews the contribution of programmers. Eventually, when the project migrates into the maintenance phase, the architect may quit the project and transfer his responsibilities to one of the programmers.</p><p><strong>He Is Ambitious.</strong></p><p>An architect does want to get something in addition to money. He wants to be the smartest guy in the room, he wants to solve complex tasks nobody else has been able to solve before, he wants to save the world. He wants all of that to be appreciated and rewarded. He wants to be number one. In most cases he fails miserably. But he always gets back on his feet and tries again. Look for the guy with ambitions if you want to hire an architect, not just yet another programmer.</p><aside class="quote">An architect wants to be a man of power, not just a smart technical engineer.</aside><p>Michael Keeling, in his recent book <a href="https://amzn.to/2tgR8uv"><em>Design It!: From Programmer to Software Architect</em></a> (worth reading), says: “On some teams, architect is an official team role. On other teams, there is no explicit role and teammates share the architect’s responsibilities.

How to hire, motivate, organize and control them—that’s what a good architect worries about.</p><p>He knows that process comes first, people next.</p><aside class="quote">An architect puts discipline on top of everything else, constantly inventing new rules and enforcing them.</aside><p>However, this is not what most software experts think. For example, according to Alistair Cockburn’s article <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/963450/"><em>Agile Software Development: The People Factor</em></a> published in IEEE Computer in 2001: “If the people on the project are good enough, they can use almost any process and accomplish their assignment. If they are not good enough, no process will repair their inadequacy—‘people trump process’ is one way to say this.” It is acceptable if a programmer thinks like that, but not an architect.</p><p>An architect puts discipline on top of everything else, constantly inventing new <a href="/2015/10/13/competition-without-rules.html">rules</a> and enforcing them. Moreover, he is not only making others obey, but also following the rules himself. Here, for example, are the rules to enforce:</p><ul> <li>No changes without a code review;</li> <li>Every idea starts with a ticket;</li> <li>The master branch is <a href="/2014/07/21/read-only-master-branch.html">read only</a>;</li> <li>Static analysis is <a href="/2018/01/16/educational-aspect-of-static-analysis.html">mandatory</a>;</li> <li>No <a href="/2016/06/27/singletons-must-die.html">singletons</a>, no <a href="/2014/09/16/getters-and-setters-are-evil.html">getter/setters</a>, and <a href="/2016/02/03/design-patterns-and-anti-patterns.html">so on</a>;</li> <li>Unit testing is mandatory for all new changes;</li> <li>No <a href="/2014/10/07/stop-chatting-start-coding.html">informal discussions</a> outside of tickets.</li></ul><p>Each project has its own set of rules. The list above is a subset of what we have on our projects at <a href="https://www.zerocracy.com">Zerocracy</a>. A good architect thinks about the rules first and about the architecture second.</p><p>I totally agree with Len Bass that “the architecture should be the product of a single architect,” as he said in his book <a href="https://amzn.to/2MvHgFY"><em>Software Architecture in Practice</em></a>. The question, however, is how exactly the architect will create the product: either in solo mode, making all technical decisions alone, or letting the team contribute in an organized and disciplined manner. The former is easy but less effective, the latter is way more difficult, but leads to much stronger solutions and better team synergy (I hate this word, but here it fits well).</p><p><strong>He Is Strong.</strong></p><p>Matthew McBride said in his article <a href="https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2007/5/5663-the-software-architect/abstract"><em>The Software Architect</em></a>, published in CACM in 2007, that “Without strong supervision from the software architect, projects and attempted solutions tend to fall apart due to the weight of unmitigated complexity.” The word <em>strong</em> is what is important to emphasize here.</p><aside class="quote">The strength of an architect is in the ability to say "No" when it's difficult to do so.</aside><p>What does strength mean in this context? An ability to stay in the office two days straight with just pizza and cola? An ability to multiply six-digit numbers in memory? An ability to memorize the purpose and design of all classes and methods? An ability to stay in a meeting with investors for three hours without checking Facebook even once? Not likely.</p><p>The strength of an architect is in the ability to say “No” when it’s difficult to do so. For example:</p><ul> <li>“No, I will <a href="/2015/02/09/serious-code-reviewer.html">not merge</a> your pull request”;</li> <li>“No, we will not implement this feature”;</li> <li>“No, you do not deserve a promotion yet”;</li> <li>“No, your code is not as good as we expect”;</li> <li>“No, this build is not stable enough to be released”;</li> <li>“No, you will not go on vacation this month.”</li></ul><p>There are many other instances of “No” which can easily turn an architect into a hated figure, but this is what his job is: to be the bad guy. This is why he has to be strong—to handle it all calmly and continue leading the project forward, toward his own well-defined technical goals.</p><p><strong>He Is Abstract.</strong></p><p>Abstract thinking is a very important positive trait of an architect. Programmers may lack that, since they are mostly focused on their own <a href="/2017/11/28/microtasking.html">isolated tasks</a>. An architect must think globally and see the product as a whole. Details are less important. He must rely on his people when talking about details.</p><p><strong>He Is Social.</strong></p><p>Software is a product of people. No matter how great the architect is, if he can’t find the right people to implement his ideas and to bring back new ideas, he is doomed to fail. The key quality of the architect is the ability to work with people: recruit, motivate, and control their results. <a href="/2018/01/23/sociotech-skills.html">Social skills</a> are what an architect needs in order to be successful in that, especially in finding new programmers and engaging them on the project. What exactly does this mean? Well, here are some examples:</p><ul> <li>High visibility in social networks;</li> <li>A long list of previous projects and teams;</li> <li>Active membership in professional groups;</li> <li>Publicity in the blogosphere.</li></ul><p>In other words, a good architect is the one with a big group of followers and supporters around him. I mentioned that in my recent talk <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GS45LzE3LPQ"><em>How Much Do You Cost?</em></a> at <a href="http://jeeconf.com/speaker/yegor-bugayenko-2/">JEEConf 2017</a>.</p><p><strong>He Is Brave.</strong></p><p>A good architect says many times a day: “It is my fault.” If an architect doesn’t have a habit of saying that frequently, he is not a good architect. He is just a programmer who is afraid of responsibility and authority.</p><p>The golden rule of a good manager is: “Success is yours, faults are mine.” This is the attitude a good architect has to express to his team. When they win, he will always find a way to celebrate and reward them. When they fail, he will take full responsibility for the failure. Because it’s his team, he found them, he motivated them, he controlled them, and he didn’t punish them properly. That’s why they failed. First of all, it’s his fault.</p><aside class="quote">He didn't punish them properly. That's why they failed. First of all, it's his fault.</aside><p>What will he do with this fault is a separate question. Maybe he will train and coach someone, maybe he’ll enforce some rules more aggressively, maybe he will even <a href="/2015/09/16/how-to-fire-someone-right.html">give someone his card</a>. It’s up to the architect. But for the outside world he will always be the guilty one and the team must know that. If they know that, they will do everything to not let the architect down.</p><p><strong>He Is Simple.</strong></p><p>“Simplicity is a great virtue,” said Edsger Dijkstra in 1984. For a programmer it’s a virtue, for an architect it’s a survival skill. An architect who can’t explain his ideas in simple words, easily understood by other programmers, is not an architect. No matter how smart he is, no matter how bright his ideas are. If they can’t be delivered in a simple form, they are worth nothing.</p><p>“If I don’t understand you, it’s your fault” <a href="/2015/06/29/simple-diagrams.html">said</a> Yegor Bugayenko in 2015. A good architect remembers that.</p><p><strong>He Is Coding.</strong></p><p>Anthony Langsworth in his piece <a href="https://goo.gl/vGN61n"><em>Should Software Architects Write Code?</em></a> argues in favor of code-writing architects and in particular says that “Understanding code means the architect can use his or her judgment more effectively rather than rely on which developer is more persuasive.” Indeed, an architect that is only capable of talking and <a href="/2015/06/29/simple-diagrams.html">drawing</a> is a weak architect that will sooner or later let the team and the project down.</p><p>How much code the architect has to write, depends on the age of the project. When the project is young and is still in the phase of prototyping, the architect produces the <a href="/2017/03/24/tdd-that-works.html">majority of code</a>. Then, later, when the product matures, the architect steps away and mostly reviews the contribution of programmers. Eventually, when the project migrates into the maintenance phase, the architect may quit the project and transfer his responsibilities to one of the programmers.</p><p><strong>He Is Ambitious.</strong></p><p>An architect does want to get something in addition to money. He wants to be the smartest guy in the room, he wants to solve complex tasks nobody else has been able to solve before, he wants to save the world. He wants all of that to be appreciated and rewarded. He wants to be number one. In most cases he fails miserably. But he always gets back on his feet and tries again. Look for the guy with ambitions if you want to hire an architect, not just yet another programmer.</p><aside class="quote">An architect wants to be a man of power, not just a smart technical engineer.</aside><p>Michael Keeling, in his recent book <a href="https://amzn.to/2tgR8uv"><em>Design It!: From Programmer to Software Architect</em></a> (worth reading), says: “On some teams, architect is an official team role. On other teams, there is no explicit role and teammates share the architect’s responsibilities. Some teams say they don’t have an architect, but if you look closely, someone is fulfilling the architect’s duties without realizing it. If your team doesn’t have an architect, congratulations, you’ve got the job!”</p><p>Michael’s point is that the architect’s position is rarely given to someone voluntarily. Instead, an architect has to fight for it and demand it. Sometimes even going straight ahead and saying “I want to be the architect!”</p><p>What is important is that it will not sound like “I want to architect this.” That would be the voice of a programmer, not an architect. An architect wants to be a man of power, not just a smart technical engineer. So, it’s way more about a title for him, rather that just his actual responsibilities.</p><p><strong>He Is Expensive</strong>.</p><p>Yes, the money question <a href="/2014/10/29/how-much-do-you-cost.html">again</a>. A good architect is expensive. If he is not, he is not a good architect.</p></div></article></div><div class="wrapper"> <related-posts /></div><div class="disqus" role="complementary"><p class="disqus_hint"> Please, use <a href="https://help.disqus.com/commenting/what-html-tags-are-allowed-within-comments">syntax highlighting</a> in your comments, to make them more readable.</p><div id="disqus_thread" class="disqus-thread"> <a>&nbsp;</a></div><script> var disqus_config = function () { this.page.url = document.location.href.split('?')[0].split('#')[0].replace('https://', 'http://'); this.page.identifier = this.page.url; }; (function() { var d = document, s = d.createElement('script'); s.src = '//yegor256.disqus.com/embed.js'; s.setAttribute('data-timestamp', +new Date()); (d.head || d.body).appendChild(s); })(); </script> <noscript><div><p class="red"> JavaScript is disabled in your browser, that's why you can't see comments under this post.</p></div></noscript></div><div class="wrapper"> <footer class="footer"><p> &copy; <span itemscope="" itemprop="copyrightHolder" itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"> <span itemprop="name">Yegor Bugayenko</span> </span> 2014&ndash;<span itemprop="copyrightYear">2018</span></p></footer></div></section><div class="wrapper unprintable" style="text-align:center;margin-top:2em;"> <a href="http://www.sixnines.io/h/3ba1652f"> <img src="//www.sixnines.io/b/3ba1652f?style=flat" alt="sixnines availability badge"/> </a></div><script src="//code.jquery.com/jquery-1.9.0.min.js"></script> <script src="/js/all.js?c401938d07c"></script> <script>var disqus_shortname = 'yegor256';</script> <script id="dsq-count-scr" src="//yegor256.disqus.com/count.js" async="async"></script> <script> (function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){ (i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o), m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m) })(window,document,'script','//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga'); ga('create', 'UA-1963507-32', 'auto'); ga('send', 'pageview'); </script> <script> Cd=document;Cr="&"+Math.random();Cp="&s=1"; Cd.cookie="b=b";if(Cd.cookie)Cp+="&c=1"; Cp+="&t="+(new Date()).getTimezoneOffset(); if(self!=top)Cp+="&f=1"; </script> <script> if(navigator.javaEnabled())Cp+="&j=1"; </script> <script> if(typeof(screen)!='undefined')Cp+="&w="+screen.width+"&h="+ screen.height+"&d="+(screen.colorDepth?screen.colorDepth:screen.pixelDepth); </script> <script> Cd.write("<img src='//c.hit.ua/hit?i=95870&g=0&x=2"+Cp+Cr+ "&r="+escape(Cd.referrer)+"&u="+escape(window.location.href)+ "' border='0' wi"+"dth='1' he"+"ight='1'/>"); </script> <script type="application/ld+json"> { "@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Person", "name": "Yegor Bugayenko", "url": "https://www.yegor256.com", "sameAs": [ "https://www.facebook.com/yegor256", "https://instagram.com/yegor256", "https://www.linkedin.com/in/yegor256", "https://twitter.com/yegor256", "https://github.com/yegor256", "https://www.pinterest.com/yegor256/" ] } </script> </body> </html> <!DOCTYPE html> <html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/WebSite"> <head> <meta charset="utf-8"/> <meta name="description" content="" /> <meta name="keywords" content="next, path, output, content, previous, url, relative_path, id, collection, excerpt, draft, categories, layout, title, date, place, tags, description, keywords, image, jb_picture, slug, ext" /> <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1"/> <meta name="google-site-verification" content="JEj_gQr2CPe2QKGw8XdMz0R7VboQIUbX3FlM-lwTq-8" /> <meta name="author" content="Yegor Bugayenko"> <meta name="article:published_time" content="2016-07-21 00:00:00 +0000"> <meta name="og:site_name" content="Yegor Bugayenko"/> <meta name="og:type" content="article" /> <meta name="og:locale" content="en_US" /> <meta name="twitter:account_id" content="4503599630178231" /> <meta name="twitter:creator" content="@yegor256"/> <meta name="twitter:site" content="@yegor256"/> <meta name="twitter:title" property="og:title" content="Convince Me!"/> <meta name="twitter:description" property="og:description" content="&lt;p&gt;I’ve already explained how I understand the &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/10/12/who-is-software-architect.html&quot;&gt;role&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/05/11/software-architect-responsibilities.html&quot;&gt;responsibilities&lt;/a&gt; of a software architect. But one question still remains unanswered, and it often turns into a problem in our projects: What does a software architect do when the project sponsor doesn’t like his technical decisions? The architect implements something in a certain way, and the sponsor (or its representative) says that it’s not exactly how things should work. What’s next?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;!--more--&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;jb_picture&quot;&gt;&lt;img itemprop=&quot;image&quot; alt=&quot;Beasts of No Nation (2015) by Cary Joji Fukunaga&quot; src=&quot;/images/2016/07/beasts-of-no-nation.jpg&quot; longdesc=&quot;#85480753&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption id=&quot;85480753&quot;&gt;Beasts of No Nation (2015) by Cary Joji Fukunaga&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;In our projects, a product owner (PO) is usually a representative of a project sponsor (the paying customer). Since all our projects are rather complex Java software packages, POs are very technical people. They are programmers or used to be programmers. They understand the code we write, and they want their opinion to be taken into account and respected.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And I’m not talking about &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/01/05/how-to-be-honest-and-keep-customer.html&quot;&gt;stupid&lt;/a&gt; product owners—those guys are a separate story. I’m talking about a pretty reasonable PO with his own technical opinion that needs to be heard.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Here is a practical example. Last week, I was &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/08/04/nine-steps-start-software-project.html&quot;&gt;starting&lt;/a&gt; a project. I was an architect. It was a Java server-side module. I decided to use Maven as a build automation system.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I created some initial files, configured &lt;code&gt;pom.xml&lt;/code&gt;, briefly explained the project structure in &lt;code&gt;README.md&lt;/code&gt;, and submitted a pull request. Chris, the product owner, reviewed it and asked, “Why not Gradle?”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It was a reasonable question, right? Gradle is another popular build automation system that I could have used, but I didn’t. The question is why. It was a pretty innocent question, and I explained the answer right there in my comment to the pull request. I said Maven was more suitable in this project because … blah blah blah.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But Chris argued back. He was still thinking Gradle was the better choice. He had his reasons. Meanwhile, I tried to &lt;strong&gt;convince&lt;/strong&gt; him of mine. I tried a few times and then realized I was doing something wrong. It shouldn’t work like that.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A software architect should not convince a product owner, a customer, or anybody else. Instead, an architect must make his decisions and be responsible for the entire success or failure of the product, just like I &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/10/12/who-is-software-architect.html&quot;&gt;explained before&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;A good architect must collect different opinions before making his own decision.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;There is a simple reason for that. Any attempt to convince anyone causes a possibility of “responsibility leakage.” What if I fail to convince? I will have to change my plan and use Gradle, right? What if the product has problems because of that decision? I will try to blame Chris for that, right? I can’t be &lt;strong&gt;fully&lt;/strong&gt; responsible for the product anymore, because I was “forced” to make at least one decision.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Don’t get me wrong; a good architect must collect different opinions before making his own decision. But collecting Chris’s opinion would look very different. I would ask him first what he thinks about Maven and Gradle. He would tell me that he doesn’t like Maven because of this and that. And I would take that into account. Or maybe not. But my decision would still be mine, made by myself, under no compulsion by anybody. And Chris would still be able to blame me for any negative consequences of that decision.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But what should Chris do if he really doesn’t like my decision? It’s his money and his product, right? He does care. And he doesn’t want to have Maven in &lt;strong&gt;his&lt;/strong&gt; product. What does he do? How can he influence my decision-making process?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s easy. There are two documents in each software project. The first one is &lt;strong&gt;requirements&lt;/strong&gt;, and the second one is &lt;strong&gt;architecture&lt;/strong&gt;. Chris should use them both to correct me and point me in the right direction. Here’s how.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;First, if he really doesn’t want to have Maven, he should make changes to the requirements document. He should add something like “the build system must be Gradle, because …” Or maybe even without the “because” part. It’s up to him. In that case, I will have to take that into account, and I will. I know my design decisions are dictated by the requirements. And not because Chris convinced me or I failed to convince him, but because that’s what the document says.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;An architect must be an absolute technical dictator during the project and must not have to convince anyone.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;Second, if he is not entirely sure that Gradle is the right choice and just wants me to be more serious about my decisions, he should complain (by submitting a bug) about the quality of my &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/08/04/nine-steps-start-software-project.html&quot;&gt;architecture document&lt;/a&gt;. He should say the choice to go with Maven is not explained properly. I will then rethink my decision and will either change it or explain it better. But again, I will do it not to please Chris but to fix a reported bug.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To summarize, an architect must be an absolute technical &lt;strong&gt;dictator&lt;/strong&gt; during the project and must not have to convince anyone. If that’s not the case, the entire project faces big risks, simply because the responsibility will be “leaking.”&lt;/p&gt; "/> <meta name="twitter:url" property="og:url"

Last week, I was <a href="/2015/08/04/nine-steps-start-software-project.html">starting</a> a project. I was an architect. It was a Java server-side module.

The question is why. It was a pretty innocent question, and I explained the answer right there in my comment to the pull request.

It shouldn’t work like that.</p><p>A software architect should not convince a product owner, a customer, or anybody else. Instead, an architect must make his decisions and be responsible for the entire success or failure of the product, just like I <a href="/2014/10/12/who-is-software-architect.html">explained before</a>.</p><aside class="quote">A good architect must collect different opinions before making his own decision.</aside><p>There is a simple reason for that.

I can’t be <strong>fully</strong> responsible for the product anymore, because I was “forced” to make at least one decision.</p><p>Don’t get me wrong; a good architect must collect different opinions before making his own decision. But collecting Chris’s opinion would look very different. I would ask him first what he thinks about Maven and Gradle. He would tell me that he doesn’t like Maven because of this and that. And I would take that into account. Or maybe not. But my decision would still be mine, made by myself, under no compulsion by anybody. And Chris would still be able to blame me for any negative consequences of that decision.</p><p>But what should Chris do if he really doesn’t like my decision? It’s his money and his product, right? He does care. And he doesn’t want to have Maven in <strong>his</strong> product. What does he do? How can he influence my decision-making process?</p><p>It’s easy. There are two documents in each software project. The first one is <strong>requirements</strong>, and the second one is <strong>architecture</strong>.

He should say the choice to go with Maven is not explained properly. I will then rethink my decision and will either change it or explain it better.

We basically define what needs to be done somehow, be it on a piece of napkin or a 100-page Word document. The next step is to turn this into a working piece of software as fast as possible and by spending as few dollars as possible. Ideally, this prototyping takes a week and is made by an architect working &lt;em&gt;solo&lt;/em&gt;. Once the “skeleton” is ready, we start putting software “meat” on it. We recruit a team of programmers for that or &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/10/27/outsourcing-doesnt-work.html&quot;&gt;outsource&lt;/a&gt; it. I see nine important steps in the skeleton creation part; let me show you them one by one.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;!--more--&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;jb_picture&quot;&gt;&lt;img itemprop=&quot;image&quot; alt=&quot;Ying xiong (2002) by Yimou Zhang&quot; src=&quot;/images/2015/08/ying-xiong.jpg&quot; longdesc=&quot;#f0013e84&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption id=&quot;f0013e84&quot;&gt;Ying xiong (2002) by Yimou Zhang&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Let’s use some examples to make this more illustrative. Let’s say I’m a software architect and the project is a “Google killer.” We’re hired to create a new search engine, and my job is to turn requirements into a prototype, a.k.a. a skeleton or a proof of concept. This is what I have as an input (let’s say it’s a piece of napkin… what else would it be for a Google killer, right?):&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Each page is ranked by the number of mentions in social networks like Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook, etc. The more mentions it has, the higher the rank and the higher its position in the search results page.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Seems like a doable project to me, and the requirements document is clear enough. It doesn’t say anything about performance, but I can assume that it has to be as fast as Google. The same goes for scalability, stress resilience, etc.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;For each decision I made, there has to be at least one alternative that I considered and rejected.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;I’m not going to discuss how the software is created in a specific technical stack. That’s not important for this article. What’s important now is how my programming work will be “wrapped.” In other words, what will I hand off to the team of programmers after a week of hard work—what is my product, or more formally, my &lt;em&gt;deliverables&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thus, let’s assume I managed to create a piece of software and it works.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;decisions-and-alternatives&quot;&gt;Decisions and Alternatives&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;First of all, I have to document my key technical decisions and their alternatives. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zerocracy.com&quot;&gt;We&lt;/a&gt; usually work in GitHub, and the best documentation media is the &lt;code&gt;README.md&lt;/code&gt; file in the root directory of the repo. I just put my text there in a plain &lt;a href=&quot;https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/&quot;&gt;Markdown&lt;/a&gt; format. That’s enough for a good technical document—it has to be short; that’s important.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For each decision I made, there has to be at least one alternative that I considered and rejected. There are two items at the top of my list:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Apache Lucene is a search engine. It is popular, mature enough, scalable, and written in Java. Alternatives are Solr, Sphinx, Gigablast, and many others. Java 8 is a programming language, and JVM is a runtime platform. I know how they work, and the team has enough experience with them. Alternatives are Ruby, Python, Go, Scala, and tons of others.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Each decision must be traceable to the person who made it.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;These decisions are very high-level, but I still need to document them. As you see, I’m not explaining &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/06/29/simple-diagrams.html&quot;&gt;in details&lt;/a&gt; why the alternatives were rejected, and it’s my choice. If someone questions my decisions in the future, they may say that the alternatives were not analyzed properly. It will be clear whose &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/10/12/who-is-software-architect.html&quot;&gt;fault&lt;/a&gt; it was—mine. So I’m taking full responsibility for these two choices I’ve made: Lucene and Java 8.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Yet another item to the list:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Three modules make up the app: UI, scraper, and analyzer. They are fully decoupled and communicate strictly through Lucene. I don&amp;#39;t see any alternatives.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Then, I attach a simple diagram to illustrate my decision:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uml/19b92d0465e2e819ffcf88cf46c6e333.svg&quot; style=&quot;width:75%&quot; alt=&quot;PlantUML SVG diagram&quot; class=&quot;plantuml&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As you see, in this case, I totally &lt;em&gt;ignored&lt;/em&gt; all alternatives. I didn’t even mention them. Again, I take full responsibility for that; I said, “I don’t see any alternatives.” If, later, a better alternative is discovered, it will be obvious why we overlooked it and whose fault it was. It’s not only about &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/01/05/how-to-punish-employees.html&quot;&gt;punishment&lt;/a&gt; but about discipline and traceability of decisions. Each decision must be &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/06/08/deadly-sins-software-project.html&quot;&gt;traceable&lt;/a&gt; to the person who made it. This helps us avoid bad decisions in the future and makes the entire project more maintainable and transparent.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Let’s add one more decision to the list:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Takes Framework is used for UI. It helps keep our code truly object-oriented, testable, fast, and decoupled from the data model. Alternatives: - Spring: It is big, complex, and ugly - Play: Similar to Spring, big and ugly - Spark: Not as clear as Takes&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;In this case, I documented the alternatives and gave my reasons why they are not good for us. As you see, the reasons are very biased; I basically expressed my personal opinions about these three frameworks and definitely gave preference to my own open source &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.takes.org&quot;&gt;Takes&lt;/a&gt; framework. Is it good? No, it’s not. But I’m the &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/10/12/who-is-software-architect.html&quot;&gt;architect&lt;/a&gt;, and I do what I think is right for the project.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I’m trying to show that the point of this documentation is for me, the architect, to explain my way of thinking—no matter how bad, biased, or &lt;em&gt;irrational&lt;/em&gt; it was. I have to write my decisions down and let the project &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/10/07/stop-chatting-start-coding.html&quot;&gt;know&lt;/a&gt; them all.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I would suggest you keep the number of documented decisions somewhere between &lt;em&gt;four and twelve&lt;/em&gt;. If there are fewer than four, I probably forgot to document something important. More than 12—I’m documenting too many non-important decisions. I should use other media for that, like JavaDoc blocks or responsive classes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;concerns&quot;&gt;Concerns&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The next chapter in the &lt;code&gt;README.md&lt;/code&gt; file has to explain how exactly I managed to address all concerns expressed in the initial &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/11/10/ten-mistakes-in-specs.html&quot;&gt;requirements&lt;/a&gt;. I mentioned above that it goes without saying that our system must be as fast and scalable as Google. Thus, let’s say there are two “concerns”—performance and scalability.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As a software architect, I must address them both. In other words, I have to prove that my solution is fast and scalable. Maybe it’s not, but if I believe it is, I have to explain why I think so. I can’t be quiet about the concerns. Here is what I would say about performance:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;The system is as fast as the Lucene search engine, while Lucene is rather fast even with large amounts of data.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;And this one is about scalability:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;The bottleneck is in Lucene, and it is scalable vertically. Not sure about horizontal scalability.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;As you see, I’m trying to be &lt;em&gt;honest&lt;/em&gt; and tell the truth. We’ll be able to review these statements later and decide whether I was right or wrong. But we need to have my answers to all concerns expressed in the requirements.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;assumptions&quot;&gt;Assumptions&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The next section is about assumptions I’ve made while working with the prototype. We usually make assumptions when we don’t have enough factual information, and we basically fill the gaps. There is nothing wrong with it, but we have to document which &lt;em&gt;gaps&lt;/em&gt; were filled and why.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;How about these two assumptions:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;1. I assume that social platforms won&amp;#39;t block our calls and will provide counters for all pages. 2. I assume that Lucene will be enough for both indexing and data storage, so we won&amp;#39;t need a database engine.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;I made these assumptions without proper analysis of the situation. I don’t know whether Twitter will be happy to see millions of requests every hour coming from our server or not. Maybe it will ban us; I don’t know. I don’t have to evaluate this and find an exact answer. I just made an &lt;em&gt;assumption&lt;/em&gt; and documented it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;I just make an assumption and call it a day.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;Will it be enough to have Lucene only, without any additional data persistence layer? I don’t know, but I &lt;em&gt;hope&lt;/em&gt; so. I don’t have time to do a detailed analysis of our entire data model and its potential future requirements. I just make an assumption and call it a day.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If later, during the handoff, the &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/01/26/happy-boss-false-objective.html&quot;&gt;project sponsor&lt;/a&gt; says this assumption exposes too much risk for the project, we’ll do a better analysis. For now, my job is to document what I see and move on. Remember, I have just a week of time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;risks&quot;&gt;Risks&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now I list all potential problems I foresee and estimate their probability and impact. Let me show you an example first:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;1. Lucene may not be able to handle billions of documents [6x9] 2. Social platforms will ban our requests [8x9]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;The first number in square brackets is the probability and the second one is the impact, on a 0 to 9 scale. If both numbers are nine, it’s not a risk anymore; it’s a &lt;em&gt;fact&lt;/em&gt;. If both numbers are zero, we can simply ignore this risk.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I listed just two, but in a real system there should be somewhere between &lt;em&gt;four and twelve&lt;/em&gt; risks. Too many risks is a sign that the prototype is not focused enough, while too few is due to a lack of attention.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;continuous-integration&quot;&gt;Continuous Integration&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now I have to make sure the product is “wrapped” in &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/10/08/continuous-integration-is-dead.html&quot;&gt;continuous integration&lt;/a&gt;, which is a &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/06/08/deadly-sins-software-project.html&quot;&gt;critical component&lt;/a&gt; of any software package. I have to configure it, preferably &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/10/05/ten-hosted-continuous-integration-services.html&quot;&gt;in the cloud&lt;/a&gt;, and make sure the build is clean.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is also important to make sure the continuous integration pipeline covers all critical areas, including:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Building on multiple platforms, such as Linux, Windows, and Mac.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Running integration tests and unit tests.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Analyzing &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/08/13/strict-code-quality-control.html&quot;&gt;statically&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Collecting test coverage.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Generating documentation.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;The goal is to make the continuous integration pipeline as fragile as possible.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;The stricter the pipeline, the better it is for the project. At this stage, my job, as an architect, is to build a “guard wall” around the product to protect it against future &lt;em&gt;chaos&lt;/em&gt;. The chaos will come from programmers making changes through pull requests. They will care much less about the entire quality of the product than I do, and that’s why I have to incorporate tools that keep the situation under control.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;My goal is to make the continuous integration pipeline as &lt;em&gt;fragile&lt;/em&gt; as possible. Any minor error should lead to a build failure. Of course, I’m talking about reproducible failures. The build should fail in a predictable way, not sporadically.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;static-analysis&quot;&gt;Static Analysis&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is yet another &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/06/08/deadly-sins-software-project.html&quot;&gt;critical component&lt;/a&gt; of any software project. You have to analyze the quality of code &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/08/13/strict-code-quality-control.html&quot;&gt;statically&lt;/a&gt;. In the most primitive approach, a static analysis will check the formatting of your source code and fail the build when that formatting is broken. However, in a more advanced variant, static analysis will catch many important bugs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;The fragility of the build is a key success factor in software development.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is called “static” because it doesn’t require the software to be running. To the contrary, unit tests validate software quality in runtime by running the app.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are many static analysis tools, for almost every language and format. I strongly recommend you use them. Moreover, I recommend you configure them as strictly as possible in order to make the build as &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/08/25/fail-fast.html&quot;&gt;fragile&lt;/a&gt; as you can. The fragility of the build is a key success factor in software development.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;test-coverage&quot;&gt;Test Coverage&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Test coverage must be collected on every build and, at the very least, reported. In an ideal scenario, low test coverage must fail the build. Let’s say I set the required percentage of coverage to 75 percent (it’s actually a more complex metric, but in a primitive approach just one number is enough). If someone introduces a new class without a unit test, the coverage percentage goes down and the build breaks.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;My job, as an architect creating a prototype, is to make sure the coverage is calculated on every build and is under control—it can’t go lower than the &lt;em&gt;threshold&lt;/em&gt; I set.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;No matter how low the threshold is, what matters is whether it is under control or not.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;continuous-delivery&quot;&gt;Continuous Delivery&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is the final step before the handoff. I have to configure a continuous delivery pipeline to make sure the product is packaged and deployed in &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/06/08/deadly-sins-software-project.html&quot;&gt;one click&lt;/a&gt;. This is a very important—critically important—step. Without it, everything done before and the piece of software itself is just a collection of files. A piece of software is a product when it is packagable and deployable in one click.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Pipeline” means that there are a number of elements chained sequentially; for a Java application, for example:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Run automated build (the same as in &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/10/08/continuous-integration-is-dead.html&quot;&gt;continuous integration&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Package JAR file&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Upload JAR file to repository&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Build JavaDoc site&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Upload JavaDoc site to Amazon S3&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;I’m using &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/07/24/rultor-automated-merging.html&quot;&gt;Rultor&lt;/a&gt; to automate the entire pipeline and simplify its start, stop, and logging. I just &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/11/03/chatbot-better-than-ui-for-microservice.html&quot;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; a “please release now” message to a GitHub ticket, and the product is packaged and deployed in a few minutes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;acceptance&quot;&gt;Acceptance&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The last step is the handoff—I have to present my solution to the &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/09/22/micromanagement.html&quot;&gt;project manager&lt;/a&gt;, the sponsor of the project, and the team. Everybody has to accept it. It doesn’t mean they will like it, and that’s not the goal. The goal is to deliver a complete solution, with risks, assumptions, decisions documented, continuous integration configured, static analysis enforced, etc. If my solution won’t be good enough for their criteria, they will &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/09/16/how-to-fire-someone-right.html&quot;&gt;change&lt;/a&gt; the architect and try again.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;My objective is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to satisfy them but to do the best I can according to the requirements and my professional understanding of the problem and business domains. I wrote about this some time ago: &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/01/26/happy-boss-false-objective.html&quot;&gt;A Happy Boss Is a False Objective&lt;/a&gt;. Again, my objective is not to make them happy. Instead, my objective is to make a perfect prototype, the way I understand the word &lt;em&gt;perfect&lt;/em&gt;. If I fail, I fail. The project will get another architect and try again.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That’s it. The skeleton is ready, and my job is done.&lt;/p&gt; "/> <meta name="twitter:url" property="og:url" content="https://www.yegor256.com/2015/08/04/nine-steps-start-software-project.html"/> <meta

We basically define what needs to be done somehow, be it on a piece of napkin or a 100-page Word document. The next step is to turn this into a working piece of software as fast as possible and by spending as few dollars as possible. Ideally, this prototyping takes a week and is made by an architect working <em>solo</em>. Once the “skeleton” is ready, we start putting software “meat” on it. We recruit a team of programmers for that or <a href="/2015/10/27/outsourcing-doesnt-work.html">outsource</a> it. I see nine important steps in the skeleton creation part; let me show you them one by one.</p><figure class="jb_picture"><img itemprop="image" alt="Ying xiong (2002) by Yimou Zhang" src="/images/2015/08/ying-xiong.jpg" longdesc="#f0013e84" /><figcaption id="f0013e84">Ying xiong (2002) by Yimou Zhang</figcaption></figure><p>Let’s use some examples to make this more illustrative. Let’s say I’m a software architect and the project is a “Google killer.” We’re hired to create a new search engine, and my job is to turn requirements into a prototype, a.k.a. a skeleton or a proof of concept. This is what I have as an input (let’s say it’s a piece of napkin… what else would it be for a Google killer, right?):</p><figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text"><span></span>Each page is ranked by the number of mentions in
social networks like Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook, etc.
The more mentions it has, the higher the rank and the
higher its position in the search results page.</code></pre></figure><p>Seems like a doable project to me, and the requirements document is clear enough. It doesn’t say anything about performance, but I can assume that it has to be as fast as Google. The same goes for scalability, stress resilience, etc.</p><aside class="quote">For each decision I made, there has to be at least one alternative that I considered and rejected.</aside><p>I’m not going to discuss how the software is created in a specific technical stack. That’s not important for this article.

I mentioned above that it goes without saying that our system must be as fast and scalable as Google. Thus, let’s say there are two “concerns”—performance and scalability.</p><p>As a software architect, I must address them both. In other words, I have to prove that my solution is fast and scalable. Maybe it’s not, but if I believe it is, I have to explain why I think so. I can’t be quiet about the concerns. Here is what I would say about performance:</p><figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text"><span></span>The system is as fast as the Lucene search engine, while
Lucene is rather fast even with large amounts of data.</code></pre></figure><p>And this one is about scalability:</p><figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text"><span></span>The bottleneck is in Lucene, and it is scalable
vertically. Not sure about horizontal scalability.</code></pre></figure><p>As you see, I’m trying to be <em>honest</em> and tell the truth. We’ll be able to review these statements later and decide whether I was right or wrong. But we need to have my answers to all concerns expressed in the requirements.</p><h2 id="assumptions">Assumptions</h2><p>The next section is about assumptions I’ve made while working with the prototype. We usually make assumptions when we don’t have enough factual information, and we basically fill the gaps. There is nothing wrong with it, but we have to document which <em>gaps</em> were filled and why.</p><p>How about these two assumptions:</p><figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text"><span></span>1. I assume that social platforms won&#39;t block our
   calls and will provide counters for all pages.
2. I assume that Lucene will be enough for both
   indexing and data storage, so we won&#39;t need a
   database engine.</code></pre></figure><p>I made these assumptions without proper analysis of the situation. I don’t know whether Twitter will be happy to see millions of requests every hour coming from our server or not. Maybe it will ban us; I don’t know. I don’t have to evaluate this and find an exact answer. I just made an <em>assumption</em> and documented it.</p><aside class="quote">I just make an assumption and call it a day.</aside><p>Will it be enough to have Lucene only, without any additional data persistence layer? I don’t know, but I <em>hope</em> so. I don’t have time to do a detailed analysis of our entire data model and its potential future requirements. I just make an assumption and call it a day.</p><p>If later, during the handoff, the <a href="/2015/01/26/happy-boss-false-objective.html">project sponsor</a> says this assumption exposes too much risk for the project, we’ll do a better analysis. For now, my job is to document what I see and move on. Remember, I have just a week of time.</p><h2 id="risks">Risks</h2><p>Now I list all potential problems I foresee and estimate their probability and impact. Let me show you an example first:</p><figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text"><span></span>1. Lucene may not be able to handle billions of documents [6x9]
2. Social platforms will ban our requests [8x9]</code></pre></figure><p>The first number in square brackets is the probability and the second one is the impact, on a 0 to 9 scale. If both numbers are nine, it’s not a risk anymore; it’s a <em>fact</em>. If both numbers are zero, we can simply ignore this risk.</p><p>I listed just two, but in a real system there should be somewhere between <em>four and twelve</em> risks. Too many risks is a sign that the prototype is not focused enough, while too few is due to a lack of attention.</p><h2 id="continuous-integration">Continuous Integration</h2><p>Now I have to make sure the product is “wrapped” in <a href="/2014/10/08/continuous-integration-is-dead.html">continuous integration</a>, which is a <a href="/2015/06/08/deadly-sins-software-project.html">critical component</a> of any software package. I have to configure it, preferably <a href="/2014/10/05/ten-hosted-continuous-integration-services.html">in the cloud</a>, and make sure the build is clean.</p><p>It is also important to make sure the continuous integration pipeline covers all critical areas, including:</p><ul> <li>Building on multiple platforms, such as Linux, Windows, and Mac.</li> <li>Running integration tests and unit tests.</li> <li>Analyzing <a href="/2014/08/13/strict-code-quality-control.html">statically</a>.</li> <li>Collecting test coverage.</li> <li>Generating documentation.</li></ul><aside class="quote">The goal is to make the continuous integration pipeline as fragile as possible.</aside><p>The stricter the pipeline, the better it is for the project. At this stage, my job, as an architect, is to build a “guard wall” around the product to protect it against future <em>chaos</em>. The chaos will come from programmers making changes through pull requests. They will care much less about the entire quality of the product than I do, and that’s why I have to incorporate tools that keep the situation under control.</p><p>My goal is to make the continuous integration pipeline as <em>fragile</em> as possible. Any minor error should lead to a build failure. Of course, I’m talking about reproducible failures. The build should fail in a predictable way, not sporadically.</p><h2 id="static-analysis">Static Analysis</h2><p>This is yet another <a href="/2015/06/08/deadly-sins-software-project.html">critical component</a> of any software project. You have to analyze the quality of code <a href="/2014/08/13/strict-code-quality-control.html">statically</a>. In the most primitive approach, a static analysis will check the formatting of your source code and fail the build when that formatting is broken. However, in a more advanced variant, static analysis will catch many important bugs.</p><aside class="quote">The fragility of the build is a key success factor in software development.</aside><p>It is called “static” because it doesn’t require the software to be running. To the contrary, unit tests validate software quality in runtime by running the app.</p><p>There are many static analysis tools, for almost every language and format. I strongly recommend you use them. Moreover, I recommend you configure them as strictly as possible in order to make the build as <a href="/2015/08/25/fail-fast.html">fragile</a> as you can. The fragility of the build is a key success factor in software development.</p><h2 id="test-coverage">Test Coverage</h2><p>Test coverage must be collected on every build and, at the very least, reported. In an ideal scenario, low test coverage must fail the build. Let’s say I set the required percentage of coverage to 75 percent (it’s actually a more complex metric, but in a primitive approach just one number is enough). If someone introduces a new class without a unit test, the coverage percentage goes down and the build breaks.</p><p>My job, as an architect creating a prototype, is to make sure the coverage is calculated on every build and is under control—it can’t go lower than the <em>threshold</em> I set.</p><p>No matter how low the threshold is, what matters is whether it is under control or not.</p><h2 id="continuous-delivery">Continuous Delivery</h2><p>This is the final step before the handoff. I have to configure a continuous delivery pipeline to make sure the product is packaged and deployed in <a href="/2015/06/08/deadly-sins-software-project.html">one click</a>. This is a very important—critically important—step. Without it, everything done before and the piece of software itself is just a collection of files. A piece of software is a product when it is packagable and deployable in one click.</p><p>“Pipeline” means that there are a number of elements chained sequentially; for a Java application, for example:</p><ul> <li>Run automated build (the same as in <a href="/2014/10/08/continuous-integration-is-dead.html">continuous integration</a>)</li> <li>Package JAR file</li> <li>Upload JAR file to repository</li> <li>Build JavaDoc site</li> <li>Upload JavaDoc site to Amazon S3</li></ul><p>I’m using <a href="/2014/07/24/rultor-automated-merging.html">Rultor</a> to automate the entire pipeline and simplify its start, stop, and logging. I just <a href="/2015/11/03/chatbot-better-than-ui-for-microservice.html">post</a> a “please release now” message to a GitHub ticket, and the product is packaged and deployed in a few minutes.</p><h2 id="acceptance">Acceptance</h2><p>The last step is the handoff—I have to present my solution to the <a href="/2015/09/22/micromanagement.html">project manager</a>, the sponsor of the project, and the team. Everybody has to accept it. It doesn’t mean they will like it, and that’s not the goal. The goal is to deliver a complete solution, with risks, assumptions, decisions documented, continuous integration configured, static analysis enforced, etc. If my solution won’t be good enough for their criteria, they will <a href="/2015/09/16/how-to-fire-someone-right.html">change</a> the architect and try again.</p><p>My objective is <em>not</em> to satisfy them but to do the best I can according to the requirements and my professional understanding of the problem and business domains. I wrote about this some time ago: <a href="/2015/01/26/happy-boss-false-objective.html">A Happy Boss Is a False Objective</a>. Again, my objective is not to make them happy. Instead, my objective is to make a perfect prototype, the way I understand the word <em>perfect</em>. If I fail, I fail. The project will get another architect and try again.</p><p>That’s it. The skeleton is ready, and my job is done.</p></p><nav class="buttons notranslate desktop-only"> <a href="http://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://www.yegor256.com/2015/08/04/nine-steps-start-software-project.html" title="Share on Facebook" class="button" rel="nofollow"> <span class="count count-facebook">0</span> <i class="icon icon-facebook notranslate" aria-hidden="true"></i> </a> <a href="https://twitter.com/share?url=https://www.yegor256.com/2015/08/04/nine-steps-start-software-project.html&amp;text=Nine+Steps+to+Start+a+Software+Project" title="Share on Twitter" class="button" rel="nofollow"> <span class="count count-twitter">0</span> <i class="icon icon-twitter notranslate" aria-hidden="true"></i> </a> <a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=https://www.yegor256.com/2015/08/04/nine-steps-start-software-project.html" title="Share on Google+" class="button" rel="nofollow"> <span class="count count-googleplus">0</span> <i class="icon icon-googleplus notranslate" aria-hidden="true"></i> </a> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/cws/share?url=https://www.yegor256.com/2015/08/04/nine-steps-start-software-project.html" title="Share on LinkedIn" class="button" rel="nofollow"> <span class="count count-linkedin">0</span> <i class="icon icon-linkedin notranslate" aria-hidden="true"></i> </a> <a href="http://reddit.com/submit?url=https://www.yegor256.com/2015/08/04/nine-steps-start-software-project.html%3F2015-31&amp;title=Nine+Steps+to+Start+a+Software+Project" title="Share on Reddit" class="button" rel="nofollow"> <span class="count count-reddit">0</span> <i class="icon icon-reddit notranslate" aria-hidden="true"></i> </a> <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/submitlink?u=https://www.yegor256.com/2015/08/04/nine-steps-start-software-project.html%3F2015-31&amp;t=Nine+Steps+to+Start+a+Software+Project" title="Share on Hacker News" class="button" rel="nofollow"> <span class="count count-hackernews">0</span> <i class="icon icon-hackernews notranslate" aria-hidden="true"></i> </a> </nav> </header> <article class="main" itemprop="articleBody"><div ><p><a href="/2016/07/11/mistakes-in-agile-manifesto.html">Agile</a> or not, a software project starts with a requirements analysis and definition. We basically define what needs to be done somehow, be it on a piece of napkin or a 100-page Word document. The next step is to turn this into a working piece of software as fast as possible and by spending as few dollars as possible. Ideally, this prototyping takes a week and is made by an architect working <em>solo</em>. Once the “skeleton” is ready, we start putting software “meat” on it. We recruit a team of programmers for that or <a href="/2015/10/27/outsourcing-doesnt-work.html">outsource</a> it. I see nine important steps in the skeleton creation part; let me show you them one by one.</p><figure class="jb_picture"><img itemprop="image" alt="Ying xiong (2002) by Yimou Zhang" src="/images/2015/08/ying-xiong.jpg" longdesc="#f0013e84" /><figcaption id="f0013e84">Ying xiong (2002) by Yimou Zhang</figcaption></figure><p>Let’s use some examples to make this more illustrative. Let’s say I’m a software architect and the project is a “Google killer.” We’re hired to create a new search engine, and my job is to turn requirements into a prototype, a.k.a. a skeleton or a proof of concept.

It doesn’t say anything about performance, but I can assume that it has to be as fast as Google. The same goes for scalability, stress resilience, etc.</p><aside class="quote">For each decision I made, there has to be at least one alternative that I considered and rejected.</aside><p>I’m not going to discuss how the software is created in a specific technical stack.

If someone introduces a new class without a unit test, the coverage percentage goes down and the build breaks.</p><p>My job, as an architect creating a prototype, is to make sure the coverage is calculated on every build and is under control—it can’t go lower than the <em>threshold</em> I set.</p><p>No matter how low the threshold is, what matters is whether it is under control or not.</p><h2 id="continuous-delivery">Continuous Delivery</h2><p>This is the final step before the handoff. I have to configure a continuous delivery pipeline to make sure the product is packaged and deployed in <a href="/2015/06/08/deadly-sins-software-project.html">one click</a>. This is a very important—critically important—step. Without it, everything done before and the piece of software itself is just a collection of files. A piece of software is a product when it is packagable and deployable in one click.</p><p>“Pipeline” means that there are a number of elements chained sequentially; for a Java application, for example:</p><ul> <li>Run automated build (the same as in <a href="/2014/10/08/continuous-integration-is-dead.html">continuous integration</a>)</li> <li>Package JAR file</li> <li>Upload JAR file to repository</li> <li>Build JavaDoc site</li> <li>Upload JavaDoc site to Amazon S3</li></ul><p>I’m using <a href="/2014/07/24/rultor-automated-merging.html">Rultor</a> to automate the entire pipeline and simplify its start, stop, and logging. I just <a href="/2015/11/03/chatbot-better-than-ui-for-microservice.html">post</a> a “please release now” message to a GitHub ticket, and the product is packaged and deployed in a few minutes.</p><h2 id="acceptance">Acceptance</h2><p>The last step is the handoff—I have to present my solution to the <a href="/2015/09/22/micromanagement.html">project manager</a>, the sponsor of the project, and the team. Everybody has to accept it. It doesn’t mean they will like it, and that’s not the goal. The goal is to deliver a complete solution, with risks, assumptions, decisions documented, continuous integration configured, static analysis enforced, etc. If my solution won’t be good enough for their criteria, they will <a href="/2015/09/16/how-to-fire-someone-right.html">change</a> the architect and try again.</p><p>My objective is <em>not</em> to satisfy them but to do the best I can according to the requirements and my professional understanding of the problem and business domains. I wrote about this some time ago: <a href="/2015/01/26/happy-boss-false-objective.html">A Happy Boss Is a False Objective</a>. Again, my objective is not to make them happy. Instead, my objective is to make a perfect prototype, the way I understand the word <em>perfect</em>. If I fail, I fail. The project will get another architect and try again.</p><p>That’s it. The skeleton is ready, and my job is done.</p></div></article></div><div class="wrapper"> <related-posts /></div><div class="disqus" role="complementary"><p class="disqus_hint"> Please, use <a href="https://help.disqus.com/commenting/what-html-tags-are-allowed-within-comments">syntax highlighting</a> in your comments, to make them more readable.</p><div id="disqus_thread" class="disqus-thread"> <a>&nbsp;</a></div><script> var disqus_config = function () { this.page.url = document.location.href.split('?')[0].split('#')[0].replace('https://', 'http://'); this.page.identifier = this.page.url; }; (function() { var d = document, s = d.createElement('script'); s.src = '//yegor256.disqus.com/embed.js'; s.setAttribute('data-timestamp', +new Date()); (d.head || d.body).appendChild(s); })(); </script> <noscript><div><p class="red"> JavaScript is disabled in your browser, that's why you can't see comments under this post.</p></div></noscript></div><div class="wrapper"> <footer class="footer"><p> &copy; <span itemscope="" itemprop="copyrightHolder" itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"> <span itemprop="name">Yegor Bugayenko</span> </span> 2014&ndash;<span itemprop="copyrightYear">2018</span></p></footer></div></section><div class="wrapper unprintable" style="text-align:center;margin-top:2em;"> <a href="http://www.sixnines.io/h/3ba1652f"> <img src="//www.sixnines.io/b/3ba1652f?style=flat" alt="sixnines availability badge"/> </a></div><script src="//code.jquery.com/jquery-1.9.0.min.js"></script> <script src="/js/all.js?c401938d07c"></script> <script>var disqus_shortname = 'yegor256';</script> <script id="dsq-count-scr" src="//yegor256.disqus.com/count.js" async="async"></script> <script> (function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){ (i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o), m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m) })(window,document,'script','//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga'); ga('create', 'UA-1963507-32', 'auto'); ga('send', 'pageview'); </script> <script> Cd=document;Cr="&"+Math.random();Cp="&s=1"; Cd.cookie="b=b";if(Cd.cookie)Cp+="&c=1"; Cp+="&t="+(new Date()).getTimezoneOffset(); if(self!=top)Cp+="&f=1"; </script> <script> if(navigator.javaEnabled())Cp+="&j=1"; </script> <script> if(typeof(screen)!='undefined')Cp+="&w="+screen.width+"&h="+ screen.height+"&d="+(screen.colorDepth?screen.colorDepth:screen.pixelDepth); </script> <script> Cd.write("<img src='//c.hit.ua/hit?i=95870&g=0&x=2"+Cp+Cr+ "&r="+escape(Cd.referrer)+"&u="+escape(window.location.href)+ "' border='0' wi"+"dth='1' he"+"ight='1'/>"); </script> <script type="application/ld+json"> { "@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Person", "name": "Yegor Bugayenko", "url": "https://www.yegor256.com", "sameAs": [ "https://www.facebook.com/yegor256", "https://instagram.com/yegor256", "https://www.linkedin.com/in/yegor256", "https://twitter.com/yegor256", "https://github.com/yegor256", "https://www.pinterest.com/yegor256/" ] } </script> </body> </html> <!DOCTYPE html> <html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/WebSite"> <head> <meta charset="utf-8"/> <meta name="description" content="" /> <meta name="keywords" content="next, path, output, content, previous, url, relative_path, id, collection, excerpt, draft, categories, layout, title, date, tags, place, description, keywords, social, image, jb_picture, slug, ext" /> <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1"/> <meta name="google-site-verification" content="JEj_gQr2CPe2QKGw8XdMz0R7VboQIUbX3FlM-lwTq-8" /> <meta name="author" content="Yegor Bugayenko"> <meta name="article:published_time" content="2015-06-29 00:00:00 +0000"> <meta name="og:site_name" content="Yegor Bugayenko"/> <meta name="og:type" content="article" /> <meta name="og:locale" content="en_US" /> <meta name="twitter:account_id" content="4503599630178231" /> <meta name="twitter:creator" content="@yegor256"/> <meta name="twitter:site" content="@yegor256"/> <meta name="twitter:title" property="og:title" content="The Better Architect You Are, The Simpler Your Diagrams"/> <meta name="twitter:description" property="og:description" content="&lt;p&gt;I don’t even know where to start. Let’s begin with this: &lt;em&gt;If I don’t understand you, it’s your fault&lt;/em&gt;. This has to be the most basic, fundamental principle of a good software architect (well, of any engineer), but most of the architects I’ve met so far, in many companies, don’t seem to believe in it. They don’t understand that the job of a software architect is &lt;em&gt;to make complex things simple&lt;/em&gt;, not the other way around. They use diagrams, which are the most popular instruments of an architect, to explain to us, programmers, what he or she has in mind. But the diagrams are usually very cryptic and hard to digest. What’s worse is that the complexity goes up in line with their salaries—it’s disgusting.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;!--more--&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;jb_picture&quot;&gt;&lt;img itemprop=&quot;image&quot; alt=&quot;A Beautiful Mind (2001) by Ron Howard&quot; src=&quot;/images/2015/06/a-beautiful-mind.jpg&quot; longdesc=&quot;#22d0142e&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption id=&quot;22d0142e&quot;&gt;A Beautiful Mind (2001) by Ron Howard&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Why is this happening? Why are their diagrams complex and difficult to read? I’m sure you know what I’m talking about; you probably have your own examples of such diagrams from projects and architects you’ve worked with. So why do we have them?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Architects are &lt;em&gt;proud of complexity&lt;/em&gt;, that’s why. They think that the more complex the problem they’re working with, the better an engineer they are. I’ve had this dialog many times:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;- You know, your diagram looks so complex ... - Oh yeah, we&amp;#39;re solving complex problems here!&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Usually, after that, the architect smiles with an obvious feeling of satisfaction. Indeed, someone actually noticed how difficult his job is and appreciated his efforts. Someone is stupid, and he is smart. He can understand this multi-tier architecture, and I can’t. He definitely earns my respect, right?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Wrong! A good architect knows his main role is to decompose a complex problem into less complex components and let programmers solve them one by one. Just as a &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/09/22/micromanagement.html&quot;&gt;good project manager&lt;/a&gt; has to decompose a complex task into smaller ones. When the problem is properly decomposed (broken down into smaller, isolated and properly decoupled pieces), the complexity &lt;em&gt;decreases&lt;/em&gt;, and it becomes easier for everybody to understand and resolve.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;A good architect would never be proud of a complex diagram.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;The main virtue of an architect is the ability to &lt;em&gt;reduce&lt;/em&gt; complexity. Thus, a good architect would never be proud of a complex diagram. Instead, he would be proud of a simple and easy-to-understand drawing with a few rectangles that perfectly explain an entire multi-tier application. That is what is really difficult to do. That’s where a true architectural mind shines.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are not many architects like that. I can’t say I’m one of them yet, but I have a few recommendations for your diagrams. Read on and remember that the main goal of all this is to &lt;em&gt;reduce complexity&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No More Than Five Rectangles&lt;/strong&gt;. If you have more, there is something wrong. Try to explain yourself in less than five. Just group some of them together and give it a name. You don’t want me to spend more than a few seconds trying to understand who is participating in the show you’re presenting. I want to see them all at one glance and immediately understand who is who. I just made up the number five, but you get the idea—make sure all diagram participants are easy to count. I’ve seen diagrams with 25 or more rectangles … that’s unacceptable.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;badge&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/2bQVt00&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.yegor256.com/images/2015/06/uml-distilled-book.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width:96px;max-width:100%;&quot; alt=&quot;badge&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use UML&lt;/strong&gt;. Well, use whatever notation you feel comfortable with, but many years ago people agreed that instead of using different notations, it would be easier to learn one for all; that’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.uml.org/&quot;&gt;UML&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a huge format/standard/language, but you don’t need to know all of it. Just learn the basics; that will be enough to express almost any idea you have. I would recommend &lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/2bQVt00&quot;&gt;UML Distilled: A Brief Guide to the Standard Object Modeling Language (3rd Edition)&lt;/a&gt; by Martin Fowler.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Direct and Annotate Lines&lt;/strong&gt;. There is nothing more annoying on a diagram than a line connecting two rectangles without any text on it and without any direction. Is it a flow of data? Is it a compile-time dependency? There are many possible meanings. Always use arrows, and always annotate them—this will help me understand you much faster.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t Use Colors&lt;/strong&gt;. Or let me put it this way: Don’t abuse colors. And in order to avoid abusing them, you be better off staying away from colors in the first place. If you need to use colors, there must be something wrong with your diagram. It’s probably too complex; that’s why you need to use colors. Simplify it by grouping elements.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t Be Creative&lt;/strong&gt;. It’s not art; it’s engineering. You don’t need to impress me; you need to deliver the message. Your goal is not to show how sophisticated your mind is. Moreover, your diagram style should not be personal. A diagram from you and a diagram from another architect should look almost exactly the same if they deliver the same message. It’s call uniformity. That’s how you make them easier for me to understand. I don’t want to have to learn your personality in order to understand your diagram. If it’s a server, draw a rectangle. There’s no need to put a 3D picture of an HP server there. A rectangle is enough. Also, please no shades, no fonts, and no styles. Again, it’s not an artistic contest. I will understand your rectangle pretty well without that “nice” shadow you’re tempted to drop. I will also understand an arrow with a default width; no need to make it wider just because your diagram editor allows you to. Don’t waste your time and my time on all this styling. Just focus on those simple lines, rectangles, text, and arrows.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;hr /&gt; &lt;p&gt;As I mentioned above, the goal of all this is to &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/04/13/tacit-css-framework-for-dummies.html&quot;&gt;reduce complexity&lt;/a&gt; and help me, a programmer, understand you, an architect. Remember, if I can’t understand you, it’s your fault. You’re a bad architect if you can’t deliver your ideas in a plain, simple form.&lt;/p&gt; "/> <meta name="twitter:url" property="og:url"

Let’s begin with this: <em>If I don’t understand you, it’s your fault</em>. This has to be the most basic, fundamental principle of a good software architect (well, of any engineer), but most of the architects I’ve met so far, in many companies, don’t seem to believe in it. They don’t understand that the job of a software architect is <em>to make complex things simple</em>, not the other way around. They use diagrams, which are the most popular instruments of an architect, to explain to us, programmers, what he or she has in mind. But the diagrams are usually very cryptic and hard to digest. What’s worse is that the complexity goes up in line with their salaries—it’s disgusting.</p><figure class="jb_picture"><img itemprop="image" alt="A Beautiful Mind (2001) by Ron Howard" src="/images/2015/06/a-beautiful-mind.jpg" longdesc="#22d0142e" /><figcaption id="22d0142e">A Beautiful Mind (2001) by Ron Howard</figcaption></figure><p>Why is this happening? Why are their diagrams complex and difficult to read? I’m sure you know what I’m talking about; you probably have your own examples of such diagrams from projects and architects you’ve worked with. So why do we have them?</p><p>Architects are <em>proud of complexity</em>, that’s why. They think that the more complex the problem they’re working with, the better an engineer they are. I’ve had this dialog many times:</p><figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text"><span></span>- You know, your diagram looks so complex ...
- Oh yeah, we&#39;re solving complex problems here!</code></pre></figure><p>Usually, after that, the architect smiles with an obvious feeling of satisfaction. Indeed, someone actually noticed how difficult his job is and appreciated his efforts. Someone is stupid, and he is smart. He can understand this multi-tier architecture, and I can’t. He definitely earns my respect, right?</p><p>Wrong! A good architect knows his main role is to decompose a complex problem into less complex components and let programmers solve them one by one. Just as a <a href="/2015/09/22/micromanagement.html">good project manager</a> has to decompose a complex task into smaller ones. When the problem is properly decomposed (broken down into smaller, isolated and properly decoupled pieces), the complexity <em>decreases</em>, and it becomes easier for everybody to understand and resolve.</p><aside class="quote">A good architect would never be proud of a complex diagram.</aside><p>The main virtue of an architect is the ability to <em>reduce</em> complexity. Thus, a good architect would never be proud of a complex diagram. Instead, he would be proud of a simple and easy-to-understand drawing with a few rectangles that perfectly explain an entire multi-tier application. That is what is really difficult to do. That’s where a true architectural mind shines.</p><p>There are not many architects like that. I can’t say I’m one of them yet, but I have a few recommendations for your diagrams. Read on and remember that the main goal of all this is to <em>reduce complexity</em>.</p><p><strong>No More Than Five Rectangles</strong>. If you have more, there is something wrong.

An architect is personally responsible for the technical outcome of the entire team. A good architect knows what needs to be done and how it’s going to be done, both architecturally and design-wise. In order to enforce this idea in practice, an architect uses two instruments: &lt;strong&gt;bugs and reviews&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;!--more--&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;jb_picture&quot;&gt;&lt;img itemprop=&quot;image&quot; alt=&quot;Rear Window (1954) by Alfred Hitchcock&quot; src=&quot;/images/2015/05/rear-window.jpg&quot; longdesc=&quot;#75d7d3a4&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption id=&quot;75d7d3a4&quot;&gt;Rear Window (1954) by Alfred Hitchcock&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;At &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zerocracy.com&quot;&gt;Zerocracy&lt;/a&gt;, we discourage any &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/08/23/communication-maturity.html&quot;&gt;communication&lt;/a&gt; between developers unless they are formally attached to the tickets or tasks we’re working on. Read more details about this approach in &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/10/07/stop-chatting-start-coding.html&quot;&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;youtube&quot;&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fuEgmibJc4&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;box&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0fuEgmibJc4/mqdefault.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;YouTube video #0fuEgmibJc4&quot; /&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;play&quot;&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;icon icon-play&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;div&gt;Who Is a Software Architect?; 13 April 2015.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;The same principle applies to an architect. We don’t use meetings, stand-ups, Skype calls, IRC channels, or any other tools where information flies in the air and stays in our heads. Instead, we put everything in writing and talk only when we’re being explicitly asked to and paid to—in tickets.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;bugs&quot;&gt;Bugs&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;With this in mind, a reasonable question may be asked: How can a software architect enforce his or her technical vision for the team if he can’t communicate with the team? Here is our answer: the architect must use &lt;strong&gt;bugs&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Bugs reported by an architect serve as communication channels between him and the team&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;A bug is a ticket that has a reporter, a problem, and a resolver, just like &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/11/24/principles-of-bug-tracking.html&quot;&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt; explains. Say an architect reviews an existing technical solution and finds something that &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/06/22/valid-reasons-to-reject-bug-fix.html&quot;&gt;contradicts&lt;/a&gt; his vision. When such a contradiction is found, it is a good candidate for a bug. Sometimes there is just not enough information in the code yet, and this is also a good candidate for a bug.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thus, bugs reported by an architect serve as &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/08/23/communication-maturity.html&quot;&gt;communication channels&lt;/a&gt; between him and the team. An architect doesn’t explain what needs to be done but asks the team to fix the product in a way he thinks is right. If the ticket resolver, a member of the team, disagrees with that approach, a discussion starts right in the ticket.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;youtube&quot;&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvVQ5NjS_Nk&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;box&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AvVQ5NjS_Nk/mqdefault.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;YouTube video #AvVQ5NjS_Nk&quot; /&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;play&quot;&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;icon icon-play&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;div&gt;Who is a Software Architect? (webinar #13); 13 April 2016.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sometimes an architect has doubts and needs to discuss a few possible solutions with the team or simply collect opinions. Again, we use bugs for that. But these bugs don’t report problems in the source code; instead, they complain about incomplete documentation. For example, say an architect doesn’t know which database to use, MongoDB or Cassandra, and needs more information about their pros and cons. A bug will sound like “our design documentation doesn’t have a detailed comparison of existing NoSQL databases; please fix it.” Whoever is assigned to this ticket will perform the comparison and update the documentation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Bugs are a &lt;em&gt;proactive&lt;/em&gt; tool for an architect. Through reporting bugs, an architect influences the project and “dictates his will.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;reviews&quot;&gt;Reviews&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;In our projects, every ticket is implemented in its own branch. When implementation is done, all tickets pass mandatory code peer review. In other words, developers review each others’ code. An architect is not involved in this process.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Through strict and non-compromising code reviews, an architect enforces his design and architectural principles&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;But when peer review is done, each ticket goes to an architect and he has to give a final “OK” before the code goes to the &lt;code&gt;master&lt;/code&gt; branch through Rultor, our &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/07/24/rultor-automated-merging.html&quot;&gt;merge bot&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is an architect’s opportunity for control. This is where he can prevent his vision from being destroyed. When the code created by a developer violates project design principles or any part of the entire technical idea, the architect says “No” and the branch is rejected.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Reviews are a &lt;em&gt;reactive&lt;/em&gt; instrument for an architect. Through strict and non-compromising code reviews, an architect enforces his design and architectural principles.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;PS. Here is how an architect is supposed to report to the &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/09/22/micromanagement.html&quot;&gt;project manager&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a

The architect is personally responsible for the technical quality of the product we’re developing. No matter how good the team is, how complex the technology is, how messy the requirements are, or how chaotic the project sponsor is, we blame the architect and no one else. Of course, we also reward the architect if we succeed. Here is what I, as &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/09/22/micromanagement.html&quot;&gt;project manager&lt;/a&gt;, expect from a good architect.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;!--more--&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;jb_picture&quot;&gt;&lt;img itemprop=&quot;image&quot; alt=&quot;Dr. Strangelove (1964) by Stanley Kubrick&quot; src=&quot;/images/2015/05/dr-strangelove.jpg&quot; longdesc=&quot;#33b2cb2b&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption id=&quot;33b2cb2b&quot;&gt;Dr. Strangelove (1964) by Stanley Kubrick&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;In all projects we run at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zerocracy.com&quot;&gt;Zerocracy&lt;/a&gt;, I expect regular reports from software architects a few times a week. Each report includes three mandatory parts: 1) scope status, 2) issues, and 3) risks.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;scope-status&quot;&gt;Scope Status&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;youtube&quot;&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fuEgmibJc4&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;box&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0fuEgmibJc4/mqdefault.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;YouTube video #0fuEgmibJc4&quot; /&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;play&quot;&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;icon icon-play&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;div&gt;Who Is a Software Architect?; 13 April 2015.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;The first and most important type of information I’m looking for is the scope status, which should be presented in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_breakdown_structure&quot;&gt;Product Breakdown Structure&lt;/a&gt; (PBS) format. No matter how complex or how small the product is, a good architect should be able to create a PBS of &lt;em&gt;four to eight items&lt;/em&gt;. For example:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;1. MySQL persistence [done] 2. OAuth login [done] 3. Input parsing in XML [75%] 4. S3 data storage [none] 5. UI cross-platform testing [none]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;That’s the size of the report I’m expecting to receive from a good architect every few days. The main goal for the architect here is to make sure that nothing is missed. No matter how big the project is, all its technical components must fit into this PBS.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The architect is &lt;em&gt;personally&lt;/em&gt; responsible for not missing the information in the PBS and making it as accurate as possible. If something is missed or the report is delayed, that becomes a good reason to change the architect.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The percentages of progress are also important here. Even though individual tasks are managed with the “0/100 completion principle” in mind, the architect must compile those percentages and make sure that compilation is accurate.

An issue is something that has already happened and we’re suffering from it. Here are a few practical examples:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;1.

Integration tests are not predictable&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Again, the list must include four to eight items (no more and no less), and the architect should mention the most critical issues there.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;risks&quot;&gt;Risks&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;youtube&quot;&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvVQ5NjS_Nk&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;box&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AvVQ5NjS_Nk/mqdefault.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;YouTube video #AvVQ5NjS_Nk&quot; /&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;play&quot;&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;icon icon-play&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;div&gt;Who is a Software Architect? (webinar #13); 13 April 2016.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now, the risks. A risk is something that hasn’t happened yet but may happen soon, and if it happens, we’ll be in trouble. The architect is responsible for keeping an eye on all potential risks and regularly reporting the most critical ones to the &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/05/24/who-is-project-manager.html&quot;&gt;project manager&lt;/a&gt;. Here is an example of a brief risk report:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;1. Deployment platform may not support Java 8 [3/8] 2. Library X may take more than the two weeks planned [7/3] 3. We may lose a good Ruby developer soon [5/6] 4. Integration tests may not be safe enough [7/2] 5. We may fail to find an open source library [3/8]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;A project manager may require additional information about each risk, but that’s another story. What is most important is to keep the project manager informed about the top of the list. Each risk has two numbers associated with it: &lt;em&gt;probability&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;impact&lt;/em&gt;, from 0 to 9. In the list above, the first risk has a probability of 3 and impact of 8. This means the architect believes that most likely this won’t happen, but if it does happen, we’ll be in big trouble.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Pay attention, as the key word in each risk description is &lt;em&gt;may&lt;/em&gt;. A risk is something that hasn’t happened yet. That’s the biggest difference between a risk and an issue. An issue is a risk that has already occurred.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;PS. Here is how an architect can enforce the principles of design and architecture: &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/05/13/two-instruments-of-software-architect.html&quot;&gt;Two Instruments of a Software

key person in a software project, which I explained in my <a href="/2014/10/12/who-is-software-architect.html">What Does a Software Architect Do?</a> post a few months ago. The architect is personally responsible for the technical quality of the product we’re developing. No matter how good the team is, how complex the technology is, how messy the requirements are, or how chaotic the project sponsor is, we blame the architect and no one else. Of course, we also reward the architect if we succeed.

In the list above, the first risk has a probability of 3 and impact of 8. This means the architect believes that most likely this won’t happen, but if it does happen, we’ll be in big trouble.</p><p>Pay attention, as the key word in each risk description is <em>may</em>. A risk is something that hasn’t happened yet. That’s the biggest difference between a risk and an issue. An issue is a risk that has already occurred.</p><p>PS.

Of course, an architect usually knows more than others and is able to communicate his knowledge with diplomacy and pedagogy when required. An architect is usually one of the smartest guys on the team.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;An architect is the one who takes the blame for the quality&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is not, however, &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; makes him/her an architect.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And this is not what the team needs. My definition of a software architect is this:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;An &lt;em&gt;architect&lt;/em&gt; is the one who takes the &lt;em&gt;blame&lt;/em&gt; for the &lt;em&gt;quality&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;youtube&quot;&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNSezrlemsY&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;box&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://i.ytimg.com/vi/PNSezrlemsY/mqdefault.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;YouTube video #PNSezrlemsY&quot; /&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;play&quot;&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;icon icon-play&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;div&gt;Hacker vs Designer Mentality; 13 April 2015.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;You can replace “blame” with accountability or responsibility. Although, I prefer to use “blame,” because it much better emphasizes the fact that every quality issue in the product under development is a &lt;em&gt;personal&lt;/em&gt; fault of the architect. Of course, together with the blame he also takes all the credit from &lt;a href=&quot;/2017/01/10/how-to-teach-customers.html&quot;&gt;happy customers&lt;/a&gt;, when the &lt;a href=&quot;/2017/12/26/software-quality-formula.html&quot;&gt;quality&lt;/a&gt; is good.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is what the team needs—someone personally responsible for the &lt;a href=&quot;/2017/04/11/flexibility-equates-lower-quality.html&quot;&gt;quality&lt;/a&gt; of the software being developed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;The job of the PM is to make sure that every technical decision the architect makes is not doubted by anyone&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;How this guy will delegate this responsibility to others is his job. Whether he will use his knowledge and skills, or quality control &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/08/13/strict-code-quality-control.html&quot;&gt;tools&lt;/a&gt;, or unit testing frameworks, or authority, or coaching, or &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/01/05/how-to-punish-employees.html&quot;&gt;corporal punishment&lt;/a&gt;—it’s his business. A project &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/09/22/micromanagement.html&quot;&gt;manager&lt;/a&gt; delegates quality control to the software architect, and &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/02/23/haircut.html&quot;&gt;it is up to&lt;/a&gt; the software architect how to delegate it further.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The role of a software architect is crucial for every project, even if there are just two coders working at the same desk. One of them has to be the architect.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;An ideal architect has all the merits mentioned above. He listens to everybody and takes their opinions into account. He is a good coach and a teacher, with a lot of patience. He is an effective communicator and negotiator. He is a diplomat. And he is an expert in the technical domain.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But, even if he doesn’t have all these merits, his decision is always &lt;em&gt;final&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And this is the job of the &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/05/24/who-is-project-manager.html&quot;&gt;project manager&lt;/a&gt;, to make sure that every technical decision the architect makes is not doubted &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/10/13/competition-without-rules.html&quot;&gt;by anyone&lt;/a&gt;. This is what delegation is all about—responsibility should always come with power.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;youtube&quot;&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvVQ5NjS_Nk&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;box&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AvVQ5NjS_Nk/mqdefault.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;YouTube video #AvVQ5NjS_Nk&quot; /&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;play&quot;&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;icon icon-play&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;div&gt;Who is a Software Architect? (webinar #13); 13 April 2016.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;As a project manager, you should regularly evaluate &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/05/11/software-architect-responsibilities.html&quot;&gt;the results&lt;/a&gt; of your architect. Remember, the quality of the product your team is working on is his personal (!) responsibility. Any problems you see are his problems. Don’t be afraid to blame him and punish him. But, always remember that in order to make your punishments productive you should give your architect full &lt;em&gt;power&lt;/em&gt; in his actions. Let me reiterate: his decisions should be final.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you, as a project manager, are not happy with the quality of the product and the architect doesn’t improve the situation, &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/09/16/how-to-fire-someone-right.html&quot;&gt;replace&lt;/a&gt; him. Downgrade him to a programmer and promote one of the programmers to an architect. But always remember that there can only be one architect in the team, and that his decisions are final.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That’s the only way of having a chance of building a perfect product.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Does your team have an official role of a Software

Do you need one? Well, most <a href="/2015/11/21/ringelmann-effect-vs-agile.html">agile teams</a> do not define such a role explicitly and work in a <em>democratic</em> mode. Every important technical decision is discussed with the entire team, and the most voted for solution wins. When such a team eventually decides to put a “software architect” badge on someone’s t-shirt, the most <em>reputable</em> programmer gets it.</p><figure class="jb_picture"><img itemprop="image" alt="Jackie Brown (1997) by Quentin Tarantino" src="/images/2014/10/jackie-brown.jpg" longdesc="#f41988de" /><figcaption id="f41988de">Jackie Brown (1997) by Quentin Tarantino</figcaption></figure><p>The badge rarely changes his responsibilities, though. After all, the team stays the same and enjoys having technical discussions together, involving everyone. In the end, a software architect is more of a <em>status</em> than a role with explicitly defined responsibilities. It is a sign of respect, paid by other team players to the oldest and the most authoritative one among them.
