content="&lt;p&gt;Nowadays, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.agilemanifesto.org/&quot;&gt;Agile Manifesto&lt;/a&gt; is a Bible of numerous software teams. It contains &lt;a href=&quot;http://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html&quot;&gt;12 principles&lt;/a&gt; which show us how software development should be organized. These principles were invented in 2001. Generally, I like and agree with all of them. However, in practice, most software teams misunderstand them. Consequently, here is a summary of what’s going on and my interpretation of each principle.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;!--more--&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;jb_picture&quot;&gt;&lt;img itemprop=&quot;image&quot; alt=&quot;Hail, Caesar! (2016) by Coen Brothers&quot; src=&quot;/images/2016/07/hail-caesar.jpg&quot; longdesc=&quot;#85dd1a6a&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption id=&quot;85dd1a6a&quot;&gt;Hail, Caesar! (2016) by Coen Brothers&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Principle #1&lt;/strong&gt;: “Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;If the customer is not satisfied, we find another customer.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;By focusing on “satisfy the customer,” Agile adepts totally forget about the “through” part. They think that a &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/01/26/happy-boss-false-objective.html&quot;&gt;happy customer&lt;/a&gt; is their true objective, while “continuous delivery” is something that obviously helps, though not crucially. However, this is quite the opposite—the customer will be satisfied &lt;em&gt;if&lt;/em&gt; the software is perfectly created and delivered. If the customer is not satisfied, we find another customer—that’s the true spirit a professional software team should adhere to. I believe that’s what the Manifesto means. We make sure that our process is “early and continuous,” which will result to customer satisfaction. We focus on improving our process, not satisfying the customer. Satisfaction is the consequence, not the primary objective.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Principle #2&lt;/strong&gt;: “Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer’s competitive advantage.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Most Agile teams understand the word “welcome” here as a permission to forget about any &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/11/10/ten-mistakes-in-specs.html&quot;&gt;requirements&lt;/a&gt; management at all. What is the easiest way to welcome change? Obviously, just get rid of any requirement documents! In this case, any change will be welcome, since it won’t affect anything. There simply won’t be anything to affect. But this is not what the Manifesto means! This principle means that our requirements management process is so &lt;em&gt;powerful&lt;/em&gt; that it can accept change at any moment. However, it’s rather difficult to achieve, if requirements are actually documented.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;youtube&quot;&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZoJ3gO4PSo&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;box&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://i.ytimg.com/vi/sZoJ3gO4PSo/mqdefault.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;YouTube video #sZoJ3gO4PSo&quot; /&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;play&quot;&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;icon icon-play&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;div&gt;Who Manages Who? (in Russian with English subtitles); 5 June 2016.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Principle #3&lt;/strong&gt;: “Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This terrific rule is usually understood as an order for the entire team. The team has to frequently deliver, while programmers are free to deliver almost nothing and who knows when. I think the Manifesto here is emphasizing on both individual and group responsibilities to frequently deliver. I also think that this frequency should be way higher than just a “couple of weeks.” Today, with modern technologies and instruments, we can deliver way faster—several times a day.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Principle #4&lt;/strong&gt;: “Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Working together means quicker turnarounds in communication not lack or roles and responsibilities.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;Working together doesn’t mean working without clearly defined rules and processes. However, most teams understand this principle as a legalization of chaos. They think that since we work together, we don’t need to define roles any more, we should not document &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/11/10/ten-mistakes-in-specs.html&quot;&gt;requirements&lt;/a&gt;, we shouldn’t care about responsibilities. Ultimately in the end, we neither know who is doing what nor the team’s structure. That’s not what the Manifesto is talking about! “Working together” means quicker turnarounds in communication and shorter response cycles. It definitely doesn’t mean lack of roles and responsibilities.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Principle #5&lt;/strong&gt;: “Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Trust doesn't mean lack of control.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;Trust is a great word and concept, but it doesn’t replace another equally great word—control. Most Agile teams think that trust means exactly that—complete lack of any validation, verification, responsibility, and control. “We trust our programmers to write perfect codes”—I’ve heard that countless times which is simply wrong. This principle means something completely different. It means that when clearly defined tasks are assigned to their performers, we fully delegate responsibilities to them. We &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/09/24/why-monetary-awards-dont-work.html&quot;&gt;motivate&lt;/a&gt; them to be fully responsible for the end result. However, we &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/02/16/it-is-not-a-school.html&quot;&gt;don’t help&lt;/a&gt; them. Instead, we trust them as self-sufficient individuals, capable of completing assigned tasks on their own.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Principle #6&lt;/strong&gt;: “The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Face-to-face doesn't mean at the same office, especially now.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;Face-to-face doesn’t mean sitting in the same office. The Manifesto doesn’t say anything about co-located or distributed teams. It’s obvious that in modern software projects, virtual communications (over video calls) are way more effective than staying together in the same country, same city, same office, and same room. Therefore, most Agile adepts still promote on-site development style, using Agile Manifesto as proof. That’s a mistake; face-to-face means something totally different from what it meant 15 years ago, when the Manifesto was written.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Principle #7&lt;/strong&gt;: “Working software is the primary measure of progress.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This doesn’t mean that we should not measure anything else. Of course, the working software is the &lt;em&gt;primary&lt;/em&gt; measure, but there are many other measures, which we can and must use. For example, the amount of features documented, implemented and delivered; or the amount of lines of code added to the project (don’t smile, &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/11/14/hits-of-code.html&quot;&gt;read&lt;/a&gt;); or the amount of &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/09/10/testing-exit-criteria.html&quot;&gt;bugs found&lt;/a&gt;; or the amounts of &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/01/19/how-expensive-is-outsourcing.html&quot;&gt;dollars spent&lt;/a&gt;. There are many other metrics. We can use many of them. However, a typical mistake many Agile teams are doing is just ignoring them all. They say “we measure only the end result.” That’s not what the Manifesto is suggesting to do though.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Principle #8&lt;/strong&gt;: “Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;We must remember that any project is first of all a money burning machine.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;This doesn’t mean that we should indefinitely &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/06/02/how-to-estimate-software-cost.html&quot;&gt;burn&lt;/a&gt; customers’ money. Yes, we should be developing at some given speed, but we should always remember whose money we’re spending—customers’ money. The Manifesto doesn’t say anything about the cost of development and that’s probably because it was written by those who make money (programmers), not those who spend it (customers). We must therefore remember that any project is first of all a money burning machine. That’s why the team must always measure its &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/01/19/how-expensive-is-outsourcing.html&quot;&gt;burn rate&lt;/a&gt; and make sure it’s aligned with the amount of business value the team delivers. Just being a &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/03/02/team-morale-myths-and-reality.html&quot;&gt;happy team&lt;/a&gt; is not what the Manifesto suggests, but that’s exactly how many understand this principle.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Principle #9&lt;/strong&gt;: “Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That’s a perfect principle that says so much and doesn’t say anything at the same time. What exactly is “attention?” I can explain. It means &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/10/13/competition-without-rules.html&quot;&gt;rules and policies&lt;/a&gt;. First of all, any policy means &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/01/05/how-to-punish-employees.html&quot;&gt;punishment&lt;/a&gt; to those who violate rules. Thus, if an Agile team really means continuous attention to technical excellence, it must have a &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/08/13/strict-code-quality-control.html&quot;&gt;quality policy&lt;/a&gt;. That policy must clearly define which design is good and which is bad, which piece of Java code is excellent, which is ugly, etc. Additionally, the policy must say what happens to those who &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/11/24/imprisonment-for-irresponsible-coding.html&quot;&gt;violate&lt;/a&gt; the principles of excellence. However, most Agile teams understand “quality” as a great flag to hang on the wall, but get scared when I ask, “what happens if someone delivers low quality?.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Principle #10&lt;/strong&gt;: “Simplicity—the art of maximizing the amount of work not done—is essential.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That’s a great rule which most Agile teams don’t follow at all. This principle means that our tasks are small and simple enough to make sure they are either doable or cancellable. Huge tasks are the biggest threat to manageability of any team, be it Agile or not. This principle encourages us to give programmers small tasks, which they can easily be completed. However, most of Agile adepts simplicity being equal to stupidity. They are not equal. A simple task doesn’t mean a stupid or non-important tasks. A simple task is a clearly defined, small, and doable work order.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Principle #11&lt;/strong&gt;: “The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Self-organized doesn't mean un-organized.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;Self-organized doesn’t mean un-organized. This rule is often translated as a legalization of &lt;em&gt;anarchy&lt;/em&gt;. We don’t need any project managers, processes, discipline, rules, or policies—we’ve got &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/02/18/holacracy-autocracy.html&quot;&gt;holacracy&lt;/a&gt; instead! We also don’t need a software architect—our programmers can make all technical decisions at regular &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/07/13/meetings-are-legalized-robbery.html&quot;&gt;meetings&lt;/a&gt;! Furthermore, we don’t want our programmers to be individually responsible for anything—they are always together in all risks and issues. Stop that nonsense! This is not what the Manifesto means. A self-organizing team is a team that doesn’t need any supervision from the outside; a team that has clearly defined roles from the inside; a team with a perfect inner discipline; a team with professional &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/05/24/who-is-project-manager.html&quot;&gt;management&lt;/a&gt;. Not with the lack of all that.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Principle #12&lt;/strong&gt;: “At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That’s a great principle which is translated into so-called retrospective meetings. They work just fine as long as decisions make the team better. Unfortunately, in most cases, programmers in Agile teams are trying to &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/10/06/how-to-be-good-office-slave.html&quot;&gt;survive&lt;/a&gt;, instead of making their teams more effective. Even though the principle says that the team has to become more effective, those retrospective meetings help programmers to become more effective (read “more secure”) in the team. That’s only natural for people, but leads to the overall degradation of the team. It’s well known that the best team is the one that is capable of quickly and inevitably &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/09/16/how-to-fire-someone-right.html&quot;&gt;rejecting&lt;/a&gt; bad elements. Does your team do that effectively? Do retrospective meetings help in that? I doubt it. Therefore, I believe that what the Manifesto means here is not the meetings. It means that the team must have an effective mechanism of self-regulation and self-improvement. Additionally, retrospective meetings simply can’t be that mechanism because they prevent the team from making difficult disciplinary decisions.&lt;/p&gt; " /> <meta name="keywords" content="next, path, output, content, previous, url, relative_path, id, collection, excerpt, draft, categories, layout, title, date, place, tags, description, keywords, image, jb_picture, slug, ext" /> <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1"/> <meta name="google-site-verification" content="JEj_gQr2CPe2QKGw8XdMz0R7VboQIUbX3FlM-lwTq-8" /> <meta name="author" content="Yegor Bugayenko"> <meta name="article:published_time" content="2016-07-11 00:00:00 +0000"> <meta name="og:site_name" content="Yegor Bugayenko"/> <meta name="og:type" content="article" /> <meta name="og:locale" content="en_US" /> <meta name="twitter:account_id" content="4503599630178231" /> <meta name="twitter:creator" content="@yegor256"/> <meta name="twitter:site" content="@yegor256"/> <meta name="twitter:title" property="og:title" content="Twelve Mistakes in Agile Manifesto"/> <meta name="twitter:description" property="og:description" content="&lt;p&gt;Nowadays, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.agilemanifesto.org/&quot;&gt;Agile Manifesto&lt;/a&gt; is a Bible of numerous software teams. It contains &lt;a href=&quot;http://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html&quot;&gt;12 principles&lt;/a&gt; which show us how software development should be organized. These principles were invented in 2001. Generally, I like and agree with all of them. However, in practice, most software teams misunderstand them. Consequently, here is a summary of what’s going on and my interpretation of each principle.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;!--more--&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;jb_picture&quot;&gt;&lt;img itemprop=&quot;image&quot; alt=&quot;Hail, Caesar! (2016) by Coen Brothers&quot; src=&quot;/images/2016/07/hail-caesar.jpg&quot; longdesc=&quot;#85dd1a6a&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption id=&quot;85dd1a6a&quot;&gt;Hail, Caesar! (2016) by Coen Brothers&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Principle #1&lt;/strong&gt;: “Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;If the customer is not satisfied, we find another customer.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;By focusing on “satisfy the customer,” Agile adepts totally forget about the “through” part. They think that a &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/01/26/happy-boss-false-objective.html&quot;&gt;happy customer&lt;/a&gt; is their true objective, while “continuous delivery” is something that obviously helps, though not crucially. However, this is quite the opposite—the customer will be satisfied &lt;em&gt;if&lt;/em&gt; the software is perfectly created and delivered. If the customer is not satisfied, we find another customer—that’s the true spirit a professional software team should adhere to. I believe that’s what the Manifesto means. We make sure that our process is “early and continuous,” which will result to customer satisfaction. We focus on improving our process, not satisfying the customer. Satisfaction is the consequence, not the primary objective.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Principle #2&lt;/strong&gt;: “Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer’s competitive advantage.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Most Agile teams understand the word “welcome” here as a permission to forget about any &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/11/10/ten-mistakes-in-specs.html&quot;&gt;requirements&lt;/a&gt; management at all. What is the easiest way to welcome change? Obviously, just get rid of any requirement documents! In this case, any change will be welcome, since it won’t affect anything. There simply won’t be anything to affect. But this is not what the Manifesto means! This principle means that our requirements management process is so &lt;em&gt;powerful&lt;/em&gt; that it can accept change at any moment. However, it’s rather difficult to achieve, if requirements are actually documented.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;youtube&quot;&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZoJ3gO4PSo&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;box&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://i.ytimg.com/vi/sZoJ3gO4PSo/mqdefault.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;YouTube video #sZoJ3gO4PSo&quot; /&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;play&quot;&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;icon icon-play&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;div&gt;Who Manages Who? (in Russian with English subtitles); 5 June 2016.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Principle #3&lt;/strong&gt;: “Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This terrific rule is usually understood as an order for the entire team. The team has to frequently deliver, while programmers are free to deliver almost nothing and who knows when. I think the Manifesto here is emphasizing on both individual and group responsibilities to frequently deliver. I also think that this frequency should be way higher than just a “couple of weeks.” Today, with modern technologies and instruments, we can deliver way faster—several times a day.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Principle #4&lt;/strong&gt;: “Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Working together means quicker turnarounds in communication not lack or roles and responsibilities.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;Working together doesn’t mean working without clearly defined rules and processes. However, most teams understand this principle as a legalization of chaos. They think that since we work together, we don’t need to define roles any more, we should not document &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/11/10/ten-mistakes-in-specs.html&quot;&gt;requirements&lt;/a&gt;, we shouldn’t care about responsibilities. Ultimately in the end, we neither know who is doing what nor the team’s structure. That’s not what the Manifesto is talking about! “Working together” means quicker turnarounds in communication and shorter response cycles. It definitely doesn’t mean lack of roles and responsibilities.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Principle #5&lt;/strong&gt;: “Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Trust doesn't mean lack of control.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;Trust is a great word and concept, but it doesn’t replace another equally great word—control. Most Agile teams think that trust means exactly that—complete lack of any validation, verification, responsibility, and control. “We trust our programmers to write perfect codes”—I’ve heard that countless times which is simply wrong. This principle means something completely different. It means that when clearly defined tasks are assigned to their performers, we fully delegate responsibilities to them. We &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/09/24/why-monetary-awards-dont-work.html&quot;&gt;motivate&lt;/a&gt; them to be fully responsible for the end result. However, we &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/02/16/it-is-not-a-school.html&quot;&gt;don’t help&lt;/a&gt; them. Instead, we trust them as self-sufficient individuals, capable of completing assigned tasks on their own.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Principle #6&lt;/strong&gt;: “The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Face-to-face doesn't mean at the same office, especially now.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;Face-to-face doesn’t mean sitting in the same office. The Manifesto doesn’t say anything about co-located or distributed teams. It’s obvious that in modern software projects, virtual communications (over video calls) are way more effective than staying together in the same country, same city, same office, and same room. Therefore, most Agile adepts still promote on-site development style, using Agile Manifesto as proof. That’s a mistake; face-to-face means something totally different from what it meant 15 years ago, when the Manifesto was written.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Principle #7&lt;/strong&gt;: “Working software is the primary measure of progress.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This doesn’t mean that we should not measure anything else. Of course, the working software is the &lt;em&gt;primary&lt;/em&gt; measure, but there are many other measures, which we can and must use. For example, the amount of features documented, implemented and delivered; or the amount of lines of code added to the project (don’t smile, &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/11/14/hits-of-code.html&quot;&gt;read&lt;/a&gt;); or the amount of &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/09/10/testing-exit-criteria.html&quot;&gt;bugs found&lt;/a&gt;; or the amounts of &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/01/19/how-expensive-is-outsourcing.html&quot;&gt;dollars spent&lt;/a&gt;. There are many other metrics. We can use many of them. However, a typical mistake many Agile teams are doing is just ignoring them all. They say “we measure only the end result.” That’s not what the Manifesto is suggesting to do though.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Principle #8&lt;/strong&gt;: “Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;We must remember that any project is first of all a money burning machine.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;This doesn’t mean that we should indefinitely &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/06/02/how-to-estimate-software-cost.html&quot;&gt;burn&lt;/a&gt; customers’ money. Yes, we should be developing at some given speed, but we should always remember whose money we’re spending—customers’ money. The Manifesto doesn’t say anything about the cost of development and that’s probably because it was written by those who make money (programmers), not those who spend it (customers). We must therefore remember that any project is first of all a money burning machine. That’s why the team must always measure its &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/01/19/how-expensive-is-outsourcing.html&quot;&gt;burn rate&lt;/a&gt; and make sure it’s aligned with the amount of business value the team delivers. Just being a &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/03/02/team-morale-myths-and-reality.html&quot;&gt;happy team&lt;/a&gt; is not what the Manifesto suggests, but that’s exactly how many understand this principle.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Principle #9&lt;/strong&gt;: “Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That’s a perfect principle that says so much and doesn’t say anything at the same time. What exactly is “attention?” I can explain. It means &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/10/13/competition-without-rules.html&quot;&gt;rules and policies&lt;/a&gt;. First of all, any policy means &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/01/05/how-to-punish-employees.html&quot;&gt;punishment&lt;/a&gt; to those who violate rules. Thus, if an Agile team really means continuous attention to technical excellence, it must have a &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/08/13/strict-code-quality-control.html&quot;&gt;quality policy&lt;/a&gt;. That policy must clearly define which design is good and which is bad, which piece of Java code is excellent, which is ugly, etc. Additionally, the policy must say what happens to those who &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/11/24/imprisonment-for-irresponsible-coding.html&quot;&gt;violate&lt;/a&gt; the principles of excellence. However, most Agile teams understand “quality” as a great flag to hang on the wall, but get scared when I ask, “what happens if someone delivers low quality?.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Principle #10&lt;/strong&gt;: “Simplicity—the art of maximizing the amount of work not done—is essential.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That’s a great rule which most Agile teams don’t follow at all. This principle means that our tasks are small and simple enough to make sure they are either doable or cancellable. Huge tasks are the biggest threat to manageability of any team, be it Agile or not. This principle encourages us to give programmers small tasks, which they can easily be completed. However, most of Agile adepts simplicity being equal to stupidity. They are not equal. A simple task doesn’t mean a stupid or non-important tasks. A simple task is a clearly defined, small, and doable work order.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Principle #11&lt;/strong&gt;: “The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Self-organized doesn't mean un-organized.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;Self-organized doesn’t mean un-organized. This rule is often translated as a legalization of &lt;em&gt;anarchy&lt;/em&gt;. We don’t need any project managers, processes, discipline, rules, or policies—we’ve got &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/02/18/holacracy-autocracy.html&quot;&gt;holacracy&lt;/a&gt; instead! We also don’t need a software architect—our programmers can make all technical decisions at regular &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/07/13/meetings-are-legalized-robbery.html&quot;&gt;meetings&lt;/a&gt;! Furthermore, we don’t want our programmers to be individually responsible for anything—they are always together in all risks and issues. Stop that nonsense! This is not what the Manifesto means. A self-organizing team is a team that doesn’t need any supervision from the outside; a team that has clearly defined roles from the inside; a team with a perfect inner discipline; a team with professional &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/05/24/who-is-project-manager.html&quot;&gt;management&lt;/a&gt;. Not with the lack of all that.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Principle #12&lt;/strong&gt;: “At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That’s a great principle which is translated into so-called retrospective meetings. They work just fine as long as decisions make the team better. Unfortunately, in most cases, programmers in Agile teams are trying to &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/10/06/how-to-be-good-office-slave.html&quot;&gt;survive&lt;/a&gt;, instead of making their teams more effective. Even though the principle says that the team has to become more effective, those retrospective meetings help programmers to become more effective (read “more secure”) in the team. That’s only natural for people, but leads to the overall degradation of the team. It’s well known that the best team is the one that is capable of quickly and inevitably &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/09/16/how-to-fire-someone-right.html&quot;&gt;rejecting&lt;/a&gt; bad elements. Does your team do that effectively? Do retrospective meetings help in that? I doubt it. Therefore, I believe that what the Manifesto means here is not the meetings. It means that the team must have an effective mechanism of self-regulation and self-improvement.

href="http://www.agilemanifesto.org/">Agile Manifesto</a> is a Bible of numerous software teams. It contains <a href="http://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html">12 principles</a> which show us how software development should be organized. These principles were invented in 2001. Generally, I like and agree with all of them. However, in practice, most software teams misunderstand them. Consequently, here is a summary of what’s going on and my interpretation of each principle.</p><figure class="jb_picture"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hail, Caesar!

(2016) by Coen Brothers</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Principle #1</strong>: “Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.”</p><aside class="quote">If the customer is not satisfied, we find another customer.</aside><p>By focusing on “satisfy the customer,” Agile adepts totally forget about the “through” part. They think that a <a href="/2015/01/26/happy-boss-false-objective.html">happy customer</a> is their true objective, while “continuous delivery” is something that obviously helps, though not crucially. However, this is quite the opposite—the customer will be satisfied <em>if</em> the software is perfectly created and delivered. If the customer is not satisfied, we find another customer—that’s the true spirit a professional software team should adhere to. I believe that’s what the Manifesto means. We make sure that our process is “early and continuous,” which will result to customer satisfaction. We focus on improving our process, not satisfying the customer. Satisfaction is the consequence, not the primary objective.</p><p><strong>Principle #2</strong>: “Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer’s competitive advantage.”</p><p>Most Agile teams understand the word “welcome” here as a permission to forget about any <a href="/2015/11/10/ten-mistakes-in-specs.html">requirements</a> management at all. What is the easiest way to welcome change? Obviously, just get rid of any requirement documents! In this case, any change will be welcome, since it won’t affect anything. There simply won’t be anything to affect. But this is not what the Manifesto means! This principle means that our requirements management process is so <em>powerful</em> that it can accept change at any moment. However, it’s rather difficult to achieve, if requirements are actually documented.</p><aside class="youtube"> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZoJ3gO4PSo"><div class="box"> <img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/sZoJ3gO4PSo/mqdefault.jpg" alt="YouTube video #sZoJ3gO4PSo" /><div class="play"><i class="icon icon-play"></i></div></div></a><div>Who Manages Who? (in Russian with English subtitles); 5 June 2016.</div></aside><p><strong>Principle #3</strong>: “Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.”</p><p>This terrific rule is usually understood as an order for the entire team. The team has to frequently deliver, while programmers are free to deliver almost nothing and who knows when. I think the Manifesto here is emphasizing on both individual and group responsibilities to frequently deliver. I also think that this frequency should be way higher than just a “couple of weeks.” Today, with modern technologies and instruments, we can deliver way faster—several times a day.</p><p><strong>Principle #4</strong>: “Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.”</p><aside class="quote">Working together means quicker turnarounds in communication not lack or roles and responsibilities.</aside><p>Working together doesn’t mean working without clearly defined rules and processes. However, most teams understand this principle as a legalization of chaos. They think that since we work together, we don’t need to define roles any more, we should not document <a href="/2015/11/10/ten-mistakes-in-specs.html">requirements</a>, we shouldn’t care about responsibilities. Ultimately in the end, we neither know who is doing what nor the team’s structure. That’s not what the Manifesto is talking about! “Working together” means quicker turnarounds in communication and shorter response cycles. It definitely doesn’t mean lack of roles and responsibilities.</p><p><strong>Principle #5</strong>: “Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.”</p><aside class="quote">Trust doesn't mean lack of control.</aside><p>Trust is a great word and concept, but it doesn’t replace another equally great word—control. Most Agile teams think that trust means exactly that—complete lack of any validation, verification, responsibility, and control. “We trust our programmers to write perfect codes”—I’ve heard that countless times which is simply wrong. This principle means something completely different. It means that when clearly defined tasks are assigned to their performers, we fully delegate responsibilities to them. We <a href="/2014/09/24/why-monetary-awards-dont-work.html">motivate</a> them to be fully responsible for the end result. However, we <a href="/2015/02/16/it-is-not-a-school.html">don’t help</a> them. Instead, we trust them as self-sufficient individuals, capable of completing assigned tasks on their own.</p><p><strong>Principle #6</strong>: “The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.”</p><aside class="quote">Face-to-face doesn't mean at the same office, especially now.</aside><p>Face-to-face doesn’t mean sitting in the same office. The Manifesto doesn’t say anything about co-located or distributed teams. It’s obvious that in modern software projects, virtual communications (over video calls) are way more effective than staying together in the same country, same city, same office, and same room. Therefore, most Agile adepts still promote on-site development style, using Agile Manifesto as proof. That’s a mistake; face-to-face means something totally different from what it meant 15 years ago, when the Manifesto was written.</p><p><strong>Principle #7</strong>: “Working software is the primary measure of progress.”</p><p>This doesn’t mean that we should not measure anything else. Of course, the working software is the <em>primary</em> measure, but there are many other measures, which we can and must use. For example, the amount of features documented, implemented and delivered; or the amount of lines of code added to the project (don’t smile, <a href="/2014/11/14/hits-of-code.html">read</a>); or the amount of <a href="/2015/09/10/testing-exit-criteria.html">bugs found</a>; or the amounts of <a href="/2016/01/19/how-expensive-is-outsourcing.html">dollars spent</a>. There are many other metrics. We can use many of them. However, a typical mistake many Agile teams are doing is just ignoring them all. They say “we measure only the end result.” That’s not what the Manifesto is suggesting to do though.</p><p><strong>Principle #8</strong>: “Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.”</p><aside class="quote">We must remember that any project is first of all a money burning machine.</aside><p>This doesn’t mean that we should indefinitely <a href="/2015/06/02/how-to-estimate-software-cost.html">burn</a> customers’ money. Yes, we should be developing at some given speed, but we should always remember whose money we’re spending—customers’ money. The Manifesto doesn’t say anything about the cost of development and that’s probably because it was written by those who make money (programmers), not those who spend it (customers). We must therefore remember that any project is first of all a money burning machine. That’s why the team must always measure its <a href="/2016/01/19/how-expensive-is-outsourcing.html">burn rate</a> and make sure it’s aligned with the amount of business value the team delivers. Just being a <a href="/2015/03/02/team-morale-myths-and-reality.html">happy team</a> is not what the Manifesto suggests, but that’s exactly how many understand this principle.</p><p><strong>Principle #9</strong>: “Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.”</p><p>That’s a perfect principle that says so much and doesn’t say anything at the same time. What exactly is “attention?” I can explain. It means <a href="/2015/10/13/competition-without-rules.html">rules and policies</a>. First of all, any policy means <a href="/2016/01/05/how-to-punish-employees.html">punishment</a> to those who violate rules. Thus, if an Agile team really means continuous attention to technical excellence, it must have a <a href="/2014/08/13/strict-code-quality-control.html">quality policy</a>. That policy must clearly define which design is good and which is bad, which piece of Java code is excellent, which is ugly, etc. Additionally, the policy must say what happens to those who <a href="/2015/11/24/imprisonment-for-irresponsible-coding.html">violate</a> the principles of excellence. However, most Agile teams understand “quality” as a great flag to hang on the wall, but get scared when I ask, “what happens if someone delivers low quality?.”</p><p><strong>Principle #10</strong>: “Simplicity—the art of maximizing the amount of work not done—is essential.”</p><p>That’s a great rule which most Agile teams don’t follow at all. This principle means that our tasks are small and simple enough to make sure they are either doable or cancellable. Huge tasks are the biggest threat to manageability of any team, be it Agile or not. This principle encourages us to give programmers small tasks, which they can easily be completed. However, most of Agile adepts simplicity being equal to stupidity. They are not equal. A simple task doesn’t mean a stupid or non-important tasks. A simple task is a clearly defined, small, and doable work order.</p><p><strong>Principle #11</strong>: “The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.”</p><aside class="quote">Self-organized doesn't mean un-organized.</aside><p>Self-organized doesn’t mean un-organized. This rule is often translated as a legalization of <em>anarchy</em>. We don’t need any project managers, processes, discipline, rules, or policies—we’ve got <a href="/2016/02/18/holacracy-autocracy.html">holacracy</a> instead! We also don’t need a software architect—our programmers can make all technical decisions at regular <a href="/2015/07/13/meetings-are-legalized-robbery.html">meetings</a>! Furthermore, we don’t want our programmers to be individually responsible for anything—they are always together in all risks and issues. Stop that nonsense! This is not what the Manifesto means. A self-organizing team is a team that doesn’t need any supervision from the outside; a team that has clearly defined roles from the inside; a team with a perfect inner discipline; a team with professional <a href="/2016/05/24/who-is-project-manager.html">management</a>. Not with the lack of all that.</p><p><strong>Principle #12</strong>: “At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.”</p><p>That’s a great principle which is translated into so-called retrospective meetings. They work just fine as long as decisions make the team better. Unfortunately, in most cases, programmers in Agile teams are trying to <a href="/2015/10/06/how-to-be-good-office-slave.html">survive</a>, instead of making their teams more effective. Even though the principle says that the team has to become more effective, those retrospective meetings help programmers to become more effective (read “more secure”) in the team. That’s only natural for people, but leads to the overall degradation of the team. It’s well known that the best team is the one that is capable of quickly and inevitably <a href="/2015/09/16/how-to-fire-someone-right.html">rejecting</a> bad elements. Does your team do that effectively? Do retrospective meetings help in that? I doubt it. Therefore, I believe that what the Manifesto means here is not the meetings. It means that the team must have an effective mechanism of self-regulation and self-improvement. Additionally, retrospective meetings simply can’t be that mechanism because they prevent the team from making difficult disciplinary decisions.</p></p><nav class="buttons notranslate desktop-only"> <a href="http://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://www.yegor256.com/2016/07/11/mistakes-in-agile-manifesto.html" title="Share on Facebook" class="button" rel="nofollow"> <span class="count count-facebook">0</span> <i class="icon icon-facebook notranslate" aria-hidden="true"></i> </a> <a href="https://twitter.com/share?url=https://www.yegor256.com/2016/07/11/mistakes-in-agile-manifesto.html&amp;text=Twelve+Mistakes+in+Agile+Manifesto" title="Share on Twitter" class="button" rel="nofollow"> <span class="count count-twitter">0</span> <i class="icon icon-twitter notranslate" aria-hidden="true"></i> </a> <a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=https://www.yegor256.com/2016/07/11/mistakes-in-agile-manifesto.html" title="Share on Google+" class="button" rel="nofollow"> <span class="count count-googleplus">0</span> <i class="icon icon-googleplus notranslate" aria-hidden="true"></i> </a> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/cws/share?url=https://www.yegor256.com/2016/07/11/mistakes-in-agile-manifesto.html" title="Share on LinkedIn" class="button" rel="nofollow"> <span class="count count-linkedin">0</span> <i class="icon icon-linkedin notranslate" aria-hidden="true"></i> </a> <a href="http://reddit.com/submit?url=https://www.yegor256.com/2016/07/11/mistakes-in-agile-manifesto.html%3F2016-28&amp;title=Twelve+Mistakes+in+Agile+Manifesto" title="Share on Reddit" class="button" rel="nofollow"> <span class="count count-reddit">0</span> <i class="icon icon-reddit notranslate" aria-hidden="true"></i> </a> <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/submitlink?u=https://www.yegor256.com/2016/07/11/mistakes-in-agile-manifesto.html%3F2016-28&amp;t=Twelve+Mistakes+in+Agile+Manifesto" title="Share on Hacker News" class="button" rel="nofollow"> <span class="count count-hackernews">0</span> <i class="icon icon-hackernews notranslate" aria-hidden="true"></i> </a> </nav> </header> <article class="main" itemprop="articleBody"><div ><p>Nowadays, <a href="http://www.agilemanifesto.org/">Agile Manifesto</a> is a Bible of numerous software teams.

Additionally, retrospective meetings simply can’t be that mechanism because they prevent the team from making difficult disciplinary decisions.</p></div></article></div><div class="wrapper"> <related-posts /></div><div class="disqus" role="complementary"><p class="disqus_hint"> Please, use <a href="https://help.disqus.com/commenting/what-html-tags-are-allowed-within-comments">syntax highlighting</a> in your comments, to make them more readable.</p><div id="disqus_thread" class="disqus-thread"> <a>&nbsp;</a></div><script> var disqus_config = function () { this.page.url = document.location.href.split('?')[0].split('#')[0].replace('https://', 'http://'); this.page.identifier = this.page.url; }; (function() { var d = document, s = d.createElement('script'); s.src = '//yegor256.disqus.com/embed.js'; s.setAttribute('data-timestamp', +new Date()); (d.head || d.body).appendChild(s); })(); </script> <noscript><div><p class="red"> JavaScript is disabled in your browser, that's why you can't see comments under this post.</p></div></noscript></div><div class="wrapper"> <footer class="footer"><p> &copy; <span itemscope="" itemprop="copyrightHolder" itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"> <span itemprop="name">Yegor Bugayenko</span> </span> 2014&ndash;<span itemprop="copyrightYear">2018</span></p></footer></div></section><div class="wrapper unprintable" style="text-align:center;margin-top:2em;"> <a href="http://www.sixnines.io/h/3ba1652f"> <img src="//www.sixnines.io/b/3ba1652f?style=flat" alt="sixnines availability badge"/> </a></div><script src="//code.jquery.com/jquery-1.9.0.min.js"></script> <script src="/js/all.js?8c0c9d2d5e8"></script> <script>var disqus_shortname = 'yegor256';</script> <script id="dsq-count-scr" src="//yegor256.disqus.com/count.js" async="async"></script> <script> (function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){ (i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o), m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m) })(window,document,'script','//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga'); ga('create', 'UA-1963507-32', 'auto'); ga('send', 'pageview'); </script> <script> Cd=document;Cr="&"+Math.random();Cp="&s=1"; Cd.cookie="b=b";if(Cd.cookie)Cp+="&c=1"; Cp+="&t="+(new Date()).getTimezoneOffset(); if(self!=top)Cp+="&f=1"; </script> <script> if(navigator.javaEnabled())Cp+="&j=1"; </script> <script> if(typeof(screen)!='undefined')Cp+="&w="+screen.width+"&h="+ screen.height+"&d="+(screen.colorDepth?screen.colorDepth:screen.pixelDepth); </script> <script> Cd.write("<img src='//c.hit.ua/hit?i=95870&g=0&x=2"+Cp+Cr+ "&r="+escape(Cd.referrer)+"&u="+escape(window.location.href)+ "' border='0' wi"+"dth='1' he"+"ight='1'/>"); </script> <script type="application/ld+json"> { "@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Person", "name": "Yegor Bugayenko", "url": "https://www.yegor256.com", "sameAs": [ "https://www.facebook.com/yegor256", "https://instagram.com/yegor256", "https://www.linkedin.com/in/yegor256", "https://twitter.com/yegor256", "https://github.com/yegor256", "https://www.pinterest.com/yegor256/" ] } </script> </body> </html> <!DOCTYPE html> <html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/WebSite"> <head> <meta charset="utf-8"/> <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ringelmann_effect&quot;&gt;Ringelmann Effect&lt;/a&gt; (a.k.a. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_loafing&quot;&gt;social loafing&lt;/a&gt;) is basically about people experiencing &lt;strong&gt;decreasing&lt;/strong&gt; productivity when working in groups.

Then, both groups received the same task—to create as many words as possible using the letters in a single given word. It’s a pretty simple task that just requires some time and creativity.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;badge&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Ringelmann&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.socialpsychology.org/images/socialfigures/ringelmann.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width:72px;max-width:100%;&quot; alt=&quot;badge&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;The first group worked as a team.

They knew that the best performer would receive a prize (a bar of organic chocolate).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I promised a prize to the co-located team too. A very similar chocolate bar.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We gave them both just 5 minutes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Our result was this: &lt;strong&gt;38 words&lt;/strong&gt; found by a co-located team and &lt;strong&gt;41 words&lt;/strong&gt; found by a distributed team.

We’re basically more productive when we work individually to achieve personal goals rather than being teamed up. That was discovered by Prof. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Ringelmann">Max Ringelmann</a> a hundred years ago in 1913. Today, during my workshop in Berlin at DATFlock 2015, we tried to reproduce that experiment. It seems the French professor was right.</p><figure class="jb_picture"><img itemprop="image" alt="The Business (2005) by Nick Love" src="/images/2015/11/the-business.jpg" longdesc="#f6d58ce8" /><figcaption id="f6d58ce8">The Business (2005) by Nick Love</figcaption></figure><p>Here is what we did. We created two groups with four people in each of them, all non-native English speakers. Then, both groups received the same task—to create as many words as possible using the letters in a single given word. It’s a pretty simple task that just requires some time and creativity.</p><figure class="badge"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Ringelmann"><img src="https://www.socialpsychology.org/images/socialfigures/ringelmann.jpg" style="width:72px;max-width:100%;" alt="badge" /></a></figure><p>The first group worked as a team. They had just one piece of paper and one pen to write down the words they found. We called them a <strong>co-located</strong> team.</p><p>The second group of four people worked in a <strong>distributed</strong> mode—they had four pieces of paper and four pens. They didn’t communicate with each other and just created words. They knew that the best performer would receive a prize (a bar of organic chocolate).</p><p>I promised a prize to the co-located team too. A very similar chocolate bar.</p><p>We gave them both just 5 minutes.</p><p>Our result was this: <strong>38 words</strong> found by a co-located team and <strong>41 words</strong> found by a distributed team. Of course, we removed duplicates and non-English words.</p><p>The distributed team was <strong>8 percent</strong> more productive than the co-located one.</p><p>Of course, this may not be a clear experiment, and we can’t use these numbers to really prove anything, but it was interesting to see how groups work and what actually motivates us to achieve results. We had an hour-long discussion afterward in an attempt to find out what each group member felt while working in a group or individually.</p><p>You can try to repeat this (or a similar experiment) in your team and check the results. Post them below in the comments; it would be interesting to see whether it does or doesn’t work in your case.</p><p>Now, my main question. If I understand it right, <a href="/2016/07/11/mistakes-in-agile-manifesto.html">Agile</a> promotes group responsibility and discourages <strong>individualism</strong>. How does it go along with the Ringelmann Effect?

A &lt;em&gt;bug fix&lt;/em&gt; is basically a patch (a pull request) to the existing code base that is supposed to solve the problem and make sure that “something” works as expected. Very often, such a patch fixes one thing and breaks many others. I believe that sometimes it’s necessary to &lt;em&gt;reject&lt;/em&gt; a bug fix and ask its author to re-do the patch in order to protect the project from bigger problems. There are a few valid reasons for such a rejection, according to my experience.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;!--more--&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;jb_picture&quot;&gt;&lt;img itemprop=&quot;image&quot; alt=&quot;El Crimen Perfecto (2004) by Álex de la Iglesia&quot; src=&quot;/images/2015/06/crimen-ferpecto.jpg&quot; longdesc=&quot;#3827b7b3&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption id=&quot;3827b7b3&quot;&gt;El Crimen Perfecto (2004) by Álex de la Iglesia&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;it-degrades-code-coverage&quot;&gt;It Degrades Code Coverage&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is a very common situation: After the changes are made in one place, unit tests fail in some other place. The bug is fixed, but some possibly unrelated unit tests start to report failure. Under pressure or simply because we’re lazy, we don’t fix them; we simply remove the tests or mark them as temporarily “skipped.” The problem is solved, the build is clean, so let’s merge the patch and call it a day, right? Wrong!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Even though I’m in favor of &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/01/15/how-to-cut-corners.html&quot;&gt;cutting corners&lt;/a&gt; as much as possible, this is the corner I don’t recommend you cut.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The unit tests are there precisely to prevent us from breaking the product when under pressure.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Obviously, there are situations when the unit tests are wrong and we have to delete them. In those cases, don’t forget to create new ones.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;badge&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/1SdcZ8M&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.yegor256.com/images/2015/04/book-legacy.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width:96px;max-width:100%;&quot; alt=&quot;badge&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are also situations when the bug must be fixed in a few minutes to put the system back online and fixing all unit tests will take an hour. Such a situation is a strong indicator that you’ve got a terrible underlying situation with test coverage in the product. There’s no doubt that we have to make a fix and ask our tests to shut up for some time. But in this case, make sure the next task your team is working on after the bug fix is released is correcting those disabled unit tests. I would recommend reading &lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/1SdcZ8M&quot;&gt;Working Effectively With Legacy Code&lt;/a&gt; by Michael Feathers, which tackles this very subject.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;it-doesnt-reproduce-the-issue&quot;&gt;It Doesn’t Reproduce the Issue&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sometimes the entire system may be down simply because of a small typo in one line of code. An obvious bug fix is to remove the typo, but that’s not what a good project is expecting from us if we care about its quality. The problem is not the typo but rather the absence of unit tests that would catch the typo at the deployment phase.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;The problem is not the typo but rather the absence of unit tests that would catch the typo at the deployment phase&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;The real problem is the lack of test code coverage in this particular section of the code. By removing the typo, we’re not helping the project in any way. Moreover, we’re doing it a disservice—we’re &lt;em&gt;concealing&lt;/em&gt; the real problem.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thus, no matter how small or cosmetic the issue is, its bug fix must contain an extra test that first reproduces the bug. Without such a test, a bug fix is a waste of the project’s money.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Furthermore, without a unit test reproducing the issue, there is no guarantee that our bug fix doesn’t introduce more bugs. I would even say that the more bug fixes we have, the higher the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_%28information_theory%29&quot;&gt;entropy&lt;/a&gt;. And the only way to decrease this uncertainty is by covering the code with unit tests. Without a test, a bug fix brings more disorder to the code base.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;it-is-too-big&quot;&gt;It Is Too Big&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Bug fixes are &lt;em&gt;not features&lt;/em&gt;; they must be small and focused. It’s a very typical mistake for programmers to get carried away while fixing a bug and introduce some refactoring together with a fix. The result is that the patch gets rather big and difficult to understand. I’m not against refactoring; it’s a very important and positive thing for a project, but do it separately &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; the bug is fixed and merged.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;No refactoring while fixing a bug!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Create a new unit test, reproduce the bug, and commit it. Fix the bug in the existing code base, no matter how ugly it is. Create new bugs, asking the team to improve the situation with the ugly code base. If interested, assign those bugs to yourself. Or maybe somebody else will be interested in fixing them and refactoring the code. But all that will happen later in other pull requests with new &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/02/09/serious-code-reviewer.html&quot;&gt;code reviews&lt;/a&gt; and new merges.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s not about being &lt;a href=&quot;/2018/04/17/how-to-be-lazy.html&quot;&gt;lazy&lt;/a&gt; and unwilling to fix what looks bad. It’s about a discipline, which is &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/01/15/how-to-cut-corners.html&quot;&gt;much more important&lt;/a&gt; than good intentions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;it-solves-more-than-one-issue&quot;&gt;It Solves More Than One Issue&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Always fix one issue at a time—simple as that. No exceptions. When a bug fix patch contains code changes that fix multiple issues, it is very difficult to understand which issue is tested, which one is reproduced, and how they relate to each other. Combining several bug fixes into a single pull request is a very bad practice.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;No matter how simple the fix is, keep it separate from others. Review, test, and merge it individually. This will also increase the traceability of changes. It will always be easy to understand who made that fix, who reviewed the code, and when it was merged (and deployed).&lt;/p&gt; " /> <meta name="keywords" content="next, path, output, content, previous, url, relative_path, id, collection, excerpt, draft, categories, layout, title, date, tags, description, keywords, image, jb_picture, slug, ext" /> <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1"/> <meta name="google-site-verification" content="JEj_gQr2CPe2QKGw8XdMz0R7VboQIUbX3FlM-lwTq-8" /> <meta name="author" content="Yegor Bugayenko"> <meta name="article:published_time" content="2015-06-22 00:00:00 +0000"> <meta name="og:site_name" content="Yegor Bugayenko"/> <meta name="og:type" content="article" /> <meta name="og:locale" content="en_US" /> <meta name="twitter:account_id" content="4503599630178231" /> <meta name="twitter:creator" content="@yegor256"/> <meta name="twitter:site" content="@yegor256"/> <meta name="twitter:title" property="og:title" content="A Few Valid Reasons to Reject a Bug Fix"/> <meta name="twitter:description" property="og:description" content="&lt;p&gt;A bug exists when something doesn’t work as expected.

Sounds logical, doesn’t it? However, there is a lot of criticism of this way of thinking. Take this one, for example: Bugs are inevitable, and instead of expecting fewer bugs from us, let us focus on the right design and let testers find and report bugs; then we’ll fix them. Or this one: Being afraid to make a mistake makes me write slower and experiment less, which translates into lower-quality software. Read more about that &lt;a href=&quot;http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/41248&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000067.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. But allow me to look at this from a different perspective and assert that yes, indeed, good programmers create &lt;em&gt;fewer&lt;/em&gt; bugs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;!--more--&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;jb_picture&quot;&gt;&lt;img itemprop=&quot;image&quot; alt=&quot;Sabotage! (2000) by Esteban and Jose Miguel Ibarretxe&quot; src=&quot;/images/2015/06/sabotage.jpg&quot; longdesc=&quot;#8a4f6549&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption id=&quot;8a4f6549&quot;&gt;Sabotage! (2000) by Esteban and Jose Miguel Ibarretxe&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;I think this is all about how we define &lt;em&gt;quality&lt;/em&gt; and what a &lt;em&gt;bug&lt;/em&gt; is.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If we look at a traditional and very “intuitive” definition of a bug, it is something that causes our software to produce an incorrect or unexpected result. However, if we think more about how the software is actually used and by whom, we’ll see that there are many other types of bugs, including scalability, reliability, and even maintainability ones.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If we put all those “-ilities” in a list and prioritize them by their severity and importance to the business, we’ll see that functionality-related bugs are rather far from the top. I would actually put &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/10/26/hacker-vs-programmer-mentality.html&quot;&gt;maintainability&lt;/a&gt; at the top.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;My point is that mistakes are not all equal. If I’m writing a PDF report generated by a piece of Java code and my report misses the footer, that’s one type of bug, and its fix will cost the business X dollars. On the other hand, if my PDF generation code is so difficult to modify that in order to change its format from &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper_size&quot;&gt;A4&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_%28paper_size%29&quot;&gt;US Letter&lt;/a&gt; we have to rewrite it from scratch, that’s a completely different type of bug. Needless to say, its fixing will be many times more expensive.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Good programmers make cheaper mistakes in order to avoid making more expensive ones.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;So yes, mistakes are inevitable. We should not be afraid of them and be ready to make them. However, good programmers make &lt;em&gt;cheaper&lt;/em&gt; mistakes in order to avoid making more expensive ones.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Good programmers understand that in the limited amount of time we usually have to implement the software, we have to sacrifice functionality in order to gain maintainability.

Within these constraints, good programmers prefer to make functionality buggy and incomplete while keeping the design clean and easy to maintain. There are exceptions, of course, where the business prioritizes functionality above everything else, but such situations happen very rarely (if the business is smart).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To summarize, I think that a good programmer makes more functional bugs than a bad programmer, though the bugs made by a bad programmer are more expensive than bugs made by a good programmer.&lt;/p&gt; " /> <meta name="keywords" content="next, path, output, content, previous, url, relative_path, id, collection, excerpt, draft, categories, layout, title, date, tags, description, keywords, social, image, jb_picture, slug, ext" /> <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1"/> <meta name="google-site-verification" content="JEj_gQr2CPe2QKGw8XdMz0R7VboQIUbX3FlM-lwTq-8" /> <meta name="author" content="Yegor Bugayenko"> <meta name="article:published_time" content="2015-06-18 00:00:00 +0000"> <meta name="og:site_name" content="Yegor Bugayenko"/> <meta name="og:type" content="article" /> <meta name="og:locale" content="en_US" /> <meta name="twitter:account_id" content="4503599630178231" /> <meta name="twitter:creator" content="@yegor256"/> <meta name="twitter:site" content="@yegor256"/> <meta name="twitter:title" property="og:title" content="Good Programmers Write Bug-Free Code, Don't They?"/> <meta name="twitter:description" property="og:description" content="&lt;p&gt;Good programmers create fewer &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/06/11/wikipedia-bug-definition.html&quot;&gt;bugs&lt;/a&gt; while bad programmers cause more. Sounds logical, doesn’t it? However, there is a lot of criticism of this way of thinking. Take this one, for example: Bugs are inevitable, and instead of expecting fewer bugs from us, let us focus on the right design and let testers find and report bugs; then we’ll fix them.

(2000) by Esteban and Jose Miguel Ibarretxe&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;I think this is all about how we define &lt;em&gt;quality&lt;/em&gt; and what a &lt;em&gt;bug&lt;/em&gt; is.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If we look at a traditional and very “intuitive” definition of a bug, it is something that causes our software to produce an incorrect or unexpected result. However, if we think more about how the software is actually used and by whom, we’ll see that there are many other types of bugs, including scalability, reliability, and even maintainability ones.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If we put all those “-ilities” in a list and prioritize them by their severity and importance to the business, we’ll see that functionality-related bugs are rather far from the top. I would actually put &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/10/26/hacker-vs-programmer-mentality.html&quot;&gt;maintainability&lt;/a&gt; at the top.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;My point is that mistakes are not all equal. If I’m writing a PDF report generated by a piece of Java code and my report misses the footer, that’s one type of bug, and its fix will cost the business X dollars. On the other hand, if my PDF generation code is so difficult to modify that in order to change its format from &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper_size&quot;&gt;A4&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_%28paper_size%29&quot;&gt;US Letter&lt;/a&gt; we have to rewrite it from scratch, that’s a completely different type of bug. Needless to say, its fixing will be many times more expensive.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Good programmers make cheaper mistakes in order to avoid making more expensive ones.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;So yes, mistakes are inevitable. We should not be afraid of them and be ready to make them. However, good programmers make &lt;em&gt;cheaper&lt;/em&gt; mistakes in order to avoid making more expensive ones.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Good programmers understand that in the limited amount of time we usually have to implement the software, we have to sacrifice functionality in order to gain maintainability.

The longer the time, the lower the maintainability. In some projects, this time requirement is close to infinity, which means it is literally unmaintainable. I believe there are seven fundamental and fatal &lt;strong&gt;sins&lt;/strong&gt; that make our software unmaintainable. Here they are.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;!--more--&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;anti-patterns&quot;&gt;Anti-Patterns&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;badge&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.yegor256.com/images/2015/06/software-project-sins-1.gif&quot; style=&quot;width:250px;max-width:100%;&quot; alt=&quot;badge&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the programming languages we’re using are too &lt;em&gt;flexible&lt;/em&gt;. They allow too much and forbid too little. For example, Java has nothing against you placing the entire application in one single “class” with a few thousand methods. Technically, the application will compile and run. But it’s a well-known anti-pattern called a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_object&quot;&gt;God object&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;youtube&quot;&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtWmlKi3ivc&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;box&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZtWmlKi3ivc/mqdefault.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;YouTube video #ZtWmlKi3ivc&quot; /&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;play&quot;&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;icon icon-play&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;div&gt;Seven Sins of a Software Project; 16 April 2016.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thus, an &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-pattern&quot;&gt;anti-pattern&lt;/a&gt; is a technically acceptable way of designing things that is commonly agreed to be wrong. There are many anti-patterns in each language. Their presence in your product is similar to a tumor in a living organism. Once it starts to grow, it’s very difficult to stop. Eventually, the entire body dies. Eventually, the entire software becomes unmaintainable and has to be re-written.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Once you let a few anti-patterns in, you will eventually get more of them, and the “tumor” will only grow.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is especially true for object-oriented languages (Java, C++, Ruby, and Python), mostly because they inherit so much from procedural languages (C, Fortran, and COBOL). And because &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/08/15/what-is-wrong-object-oriented-programming.html&quot;&gt;OOP&lt;/a&gt; developers tend to think in a procedural and imperative way. Unfortunately.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;By the way, in addition to an existing &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-pattern&quot;&gt;list of well-known anti-patterns&lt;/a&gt;, I also consider &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/09/10/anti-patterns-in-oop.html&quot;&gt;these few things&lt;/a&gt; as rather bad coding approaches.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;My only practical suggestion here is to read and learn. Maybe &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/04/22/favorite-software-books.html&quot;&gt;these books&lt;/a&gt; will help you or my book “&lt;a href=&quot;/elegant-objects.html&quot;&gt;Elegant Objects&lt;/a&gt;.” Always try to be skeptical about the quality of your software, and don’t relax when it “just works.” Like with cancer, the earlier you diagnose it, greater is the chance to survive.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;untraceable-changes&quot;&gt;Untraceable Changes&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;badge&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.yegor256.com/images/2015/06/software-project-sins-2.gif&quot; style=&quot;width:250px;max-width:100%;&quot; alt=&quot;badge&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;When I look at the commit history, I should be able to tell for every single change &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; was changed, &lt;em&gt;who&lt;/em&gt; made a change, and &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; the change was made. Moreover, the time required to get those three answers must be measured in seconds. In most projects, this is not the case. Here are a few practical recommendations:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Always Use Tickets&lt;/strong&gt;. No matter how small the project or its team is, even if it’s just yourself, create tickets (GitHub issues) for every problem you’re solving. Explain the problem briefly in the ticket and document your thinking there. Use the ticket as temporary storage for all information related to the problem. Post everything that could make any sense in the future, when someone else will try to understand what those “few strange commits” were about.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reference Tickets in Commits&lt;/strong&gt;. Needless to say, every commit must have a message. Commits without messages are a very dirty practice; I won’t even discuss why. But just a message is not enough. Every message must start with the number of the ticket you’re working with. GitHub (I’m sure you are using it) will automatically link commits and tickets, increasing &lt;em&gt;traceability&lt;/em&gt; of changes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t Delete Anything&lt;/strong&gt;. Git allows us to do a “forced” push, which overwrites the entire branch that previously existed on the server. This is just one example of how you can destroy the history of development. Many times I’ve also seen people delete their comments in GitHub discussions to make tickets look more “clean.” That’s just wrong. Never delete anything; let your history stay with you, no matter how bad (or messy) it may look to you now.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;ad-hoc-releases&quot;&gt;Ad Hoc Releases&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;badge&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.yegor256.com/images/2015/06/software-project-sins-3.gif&quot; style=&quot;width:250px;max-width:100%;&quot; alt=&quot;badge&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Every piece of software must be packaged before it can be delivered to the end user. If it’s a Java library, it has to be packaged as a &lt;code&gt;.jar&lt;/code&gt; file and released to some repository; if it’s a web app, it has to be deployed to some platform, etc. No matter how small or big the product is, there is always a standard procedure that tests, packages, and deploys.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;An ideal solution would be to automate this procedure so it is possible to execute it from a command line with a single command:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;$ ./release.sh ... DONE &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;took &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;98&lt;/span&gt;.7s&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Most projects are far from that. Their release process always involves some magic, where the person responsible for it (also known as a DevOp) has to click some buttons here and there, login somewhere, check some metrics, etc. Such an &lt;em&gt;ad hoc&lt;/em&gt; release process is still a very typical sin of the entire software engineering industry.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I can give only one practical piece of advice here: Automate it. I use &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/09/11/deployment-script-vs-rultor.html&quot;&gt;rultor.com&lt;/a&gt; for that, but you can use whatever tools you like. What is important is that the entire procedure is fully automated and can be executed from the command line.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;volunteer-static-analysis&quot;&gt;Volunteer Static Analysis&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;badge&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.yegor256.com/images/2015/06/software-project-sins-4.gif&quot; style=&quot;width:250px;max-width:100%;&quot; alt=&quot;badge&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_program_analysis&quot;&gt;Static analysis&lt;/a&gt; is what makes our code &lt;em&gt;look&lt;/em&gt; better. And by making it look better, we are inevitably making it &lt;em&gt;work&lt;/em&gt; better. But this happens only when the entire team is forced (!) to follow the rules dictated by the static analyzer(s). I’ve written about this in &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/08/13/strict-code-quality-control.html&quot;&gt;Strict Control of Java Code Quality&lt;/a&gt;. I use &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.qulice.com&quot;&gt;qulice.com&lt;/a&gt; in Java projects and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop&quot;&gt;rubocop&lt;/a&gt; in Ruby, but there are many similar tools for nearly every language.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;youtube&quot;&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkXLOxZ6Fs4&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;box&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hkXLOxZ6Fs4/mqdefault.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;YouTube video #hkXLOxZ6Fs4&quot; /&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;play&quot;&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;icon icon-play&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;div&gt;Seven Sins of a Software Project; 16 November 2016.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;You can use any of them, but make it mandatory! In most projects where static analysis is used, developers just build nicely-looking reports and continue to write code the way they did before. Such a “volunteer” approach is not doing any favors for the project. Moreover, it creates an illusion of quality.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What I’m saying is that static analysis must be a mandatory step in your deployment pipeline. The build can’t pass if any static analysis rule is violated.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;unknown-test-coverage&quot;&gt;Unknown Test Coverage&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;badge&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.yegor256.com/images/2015/06/software-project-sins-5.gif&quot; style=&quot;width:250px;max-width:100%;&quot; alt=&quot;badge&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Simply put, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_coverage&quot;&gt;test coverage&lt;/a&gt; is the degree to which the software has been &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/07/16/fools-dont-write-unit-tests.html&quot;&gt;tested&lt;/a&gt; by unit or integration tests. The higher the coverage, the greater “amount” of code was executed while tests were running. Obviously, higher coverage is a good thing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, many project developers simply don’t know their coverage. They just don’t measure this metric. They may have some tests, but nobody knows how deeply they penetrate the software and what parts of it are not tested at all. This situation is much worse than low test coverage that is measured and reported to everyone.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;High coverage is not a guarantee of high quality. That’s obvious. But unknown coverage is a clear indicator of maintainability problems. When a new developer enters the project, he or she should be able to make some changes and see how coverage is affected by them. Ideally, test coverage should be checked the same way as static analysis, and the build should fail if it comes out lower than a certain pre-defined threshold (usually somewhere around 80 percent).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;nonstop-development&quot;&gt;Nonstop Development&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;badge&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.yegor256.com/images/2015/06/software-project-sins-6.gif&quot; style=&quot;width:250px;max-width:100%;&quot; alt=&quot;badge&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;What I mean by nonstop is without milestones and releases. No matter what kind of software you’re writing, you must release and &lt;a href=&quot;http://semver.org/&quot;&gt;versionalize&lt;/a&gt; it frequently. A project without a clear release history is an unmaintainable mess.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is mostly because maintainability is all about me being able to understand you by reading your code.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When I look into the source code and its commit and release history, I have to be able to tell what the intention of its author(s) was, what the project was doing a year ago, where it is going now, what its roadmap is, etc. All this information must be in the source code and, more importantly, in Git history.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Tagging&quot;&gt;Git tags&lt;/a&gt; and GitHub &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/blog/1547-release-your-software&quot;&gt;release notes&lt;/a&gt; are two powerful instruments that provide me such information. Use them to their full extent. Also, don’t forget that each binary version of the product must be available for immediate download. I have to be able to download version 0.1.3 and test it right now, even if the project is working on 3.4 at the moment.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;undocumented-interfaces&quot;&gt;Undocumented Interfaces&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;badge&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.yegor256.com/images/2015/06/software-project-sins-7.gif&quot; style=&quot;width:250px;max-width:100%;&quot; alt=&quot;badge&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Every piece of software has interfaces through which it is supposed to be used. If it’s a Ruby gem, there are classes and methods that I’m going to use as an end user of it. If it’s a web app, there are web pages that an end user will see and control in order to use the app. Every software project has interfaces, and they must be carefully documented.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Like everything above, this is also about maintainability. As a new programmer on a project, I will start to learn about it from its interfaces. I should be able to understand what it does and try to use it myself.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I’m talking here about documentation for users, not for developers. In general, I’m against documentation inside the software. Here I totally agree with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://agilemanifesto.org/&quot;&gt;Agile Manifesto&lt;/a&gt;—working software is much more important than comprehensive documentation. But that’s not referring to “external” documentation, which is supposed to be read by users, not developers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So end-user interaction with the software must be clearly documented.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If your software is a library, then its end users are software developers who are going to use it—not contribute to it but simply use it as a “black box.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;hr /&gt; &lt;p&gt;These are the criteria being used to evaluate the open source projects entered in our &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/04/16/award.html&quot;&gt;award&lt;/a&gt; competition.&lt;/p&gt; " /> <meta name="keywords" content="next, path, output, content, previous, url, relative_path, id, collection, excerpt, draft, categories, layout, title, date, tags, description, keywords, translated, social, slug, ext" /> <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1"/> <meta name="google-site-verification" content="JEj_gQr2CPe2QKGw8XdMz0R7VboQIUbX3FlM-lwTq-8" /> <meta name="author" content="Yegor Bugayenko"> <meta name="article:published_time" content="2015-06-08 00:00:00 +0000"> <meta name="og:site_name" content="Yegor Bugayenko"/> <meta name="og:type" content="article" /> <meta name="og:locale" content="en_US" /> <meta name="twitter:account_id" content="4503599630178231" /> <meta name="twitter:creator" content="@yegor256"/> <meta name="twitter:site" content="@yegor256"/> <meta name="twitter:title" property="og:title" content="Seven Deadly Sins of a Software Project"/> <meta name="twitter:description" property="og:description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Maintainability&lt;/em&gt; is the &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/10/26/hacker-vs-programmer-mentality.html&quot;&gt;most valuable virtue&lt;/a&gt; of modern software development. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maintainability&quot;&gt;Maintainability&lt;/a&gt; can basically be measured as the working time required for a new developer to learn the software before he or she can start making serious changes in it.

Git allows us to do a “forced” push, which overwrites the entire branch that previously existed on the server. This is just one example of how you can destroy the history of development. Many times I’ve also seen people delete their comments in GitHub discussions to make tickets look more “clean.” That’s just wrong. Never delete anything; let your history stay with you, no matter how bad (or messy) it may look to you now.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;ad-hoc-releases&quot;&gt;Ad Hoc Releases&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;badge&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.yegor256.com/images/2015/06/software-project-sins-3.gif&quot; style=&quot;width:250px;max-width:100%;&quot; alt=&quot;badge&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Every piece of software must be packaged before it can be delivered to the end user. If it’s a Java library, it has to be packaged as a &lt;code&gt;.jar&lt;/code&gt; file and released to some repository; if it’s a web app, it has to be deployed to some platform, etc. No matter how small or big the product is, there is always a standard procedure that tests, packages, and deploys.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;An ideal solution would be to automate this procedure so it is possible to execute it from a command line with a single command:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;$ ./release.sh ...

Their release process always involves some magic, where the person responsible for it (also known as a DevOp) has to click some buttons here and there, login somewhere, check some metrics, etc. Such an &lt;em&gt;ad hoc&lt;/em&gt; release process is still a very typical sin of the entire software engineering industry.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I can give only one practical piece of advice here: Automate it. I use &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/09/11/deployment-script-vs-rultor.html&quot;&gt;rultor.com&lt;/a&gt; for that, but you can use whatever tools you like. What is important is that the entire procedure is fully automated and can be executed from the command line.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;volunteer-static-analysis&quot;&gt;Volunteer Static Analysis&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;badge&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.yegor256.com/images/2015/06/software-project-sins-4.gif&quot; style=&quot;width:250px;max-width:100%;&quot; alt=&quot;badge&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_program_analysis&quot;&gt;Static analysis&lt;/a&gt; is what makes our code &lt;em&gt;look&lt;/em&gt; better. And by making it look better, we are inevitably making it &lt;em&gt;work&lt;/em&gt; better. But this happens only when the entire team is forced (!) to follow the rules dictated by the static analyzer(s). I’ve written about this in &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/08/13/strict-code-quality-control.html&quot;&gt;Strict Control of Java Code Quality&lt;/a&gt;. I use &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.qulice.com&quot;&gt;qulice.com&lt;/a&gt; in Java projects and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop&quot;&gt;rubocop&lt;/a&gt; in Ruby, but there are many similar tools for nearly every language.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;youtube&quot;&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkXLOxZ6Fs4&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;box&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hkXLOxZ6Fs4/mqdefault.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;YouTube video #hkXLOxZ6Fs4&quot; /&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;play&quot;&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;icon icon-play&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;div&gt;Seven Sins of a Software Project; 16 November 2016.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;You can use any of them, but make it mandatory! In most projects where static analysis is used, developers just build nicely-looking reports and continue to write code the way they did before. Such a “volunteer” approach is not doing any favors for the project. Moreover, it creates an illusion of quality.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What I’m saying is that static analysis must be a mandatory step in your deployment pipeline. The build can’t pass if any static analysis rule is violated.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;unknown-test-coverage&quot;&gt;Unknown Test Coverage&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;badge&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.yegor256.com/images/2015/06/software-project-sins-5.gif&quot; style=&quot;width:250px;max-width:100%;&quot; alt=&quot;badge&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Simply put, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_coverage&quot;&gt;test coverage&lt;/a&gt; is the degree to which the software has been &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/07/16/fools-dont-write-unit-tests.html&quot;&gt;tested&lt;/a&gt; by unit or integration tests. The higher the coverage, the greater “amount” of code was executed while tests were running. Obviously, higher coverage is a good thing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, many project developers simply don’t know their coverage. They just don’t measure this metric. They may have some tests, but nobody knows how deeply they penetrate the software and what parts of it are not tested at all. This situation is much worse than low test coverage that is measured and reported to everyone.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;High coverage is not a guarantee of high quality. That’s obvious. But unknown coverage is a clear indicator of maintainability problems. When a new developer enters the project, he or she should be able to make some changes and see how coverage is affected by them. Ideally, test coverage should be checked the same way as static analysis, and the build should fail if it comes out lower than a certain pre-defined threshold (usually somewhere around 80 percent).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;nonstop-development&quot;&gt;Nonstop Development&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;badge&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.yegor256.com/images/2015/06/software-project-sins-6.gif&quot; style=&quot;width:250px;max-width:100%;&quot; alt=&quot;badge&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;What I mean by nonstop is without milestones and releases. No matter what kind of software you’re writing, you must release and &lt;a href=&quot;http://semver.org/&quot;&gt;versionalize&lt;/a&gt; it frequently. A project without a clear release history is an unmaintainable mess.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is mostly because maintainability is all about me being able to understand you by reading your code.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When I look into the source code and its commit and release history, I have to be able to tell what the intention of its author(s) was, what the project was doing a year ago, where it is going now, what its roadmap is, etc. All this information must be in the source code and, more importantly, in Git history.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Tagging&quot;&gt;Git tags&lt;/a&gt; and GitHub &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/blog/1547-release-your-software&quot;&gt;release notes&lt;/a&gt; are two powerful instruments that provide me such information. Use them to their full extent. Also, don’t forget that each binary version of the product must be available for immediate download. I have to be able to download version 0.1.3 and test it right now, even if the project is working on 3.4 at the moment.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;undocumented-interfaces&quot;&gt;Undocumented Interfaces&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;badge&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.yegor256.com/images/2015/06/software-project-sins-7.gif&quot; style=&quot;width:250px;max-width:100%;&quot; alt=&quot;badge&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Every piece of software has interfaces through which it is supposed to be used. If it’s a Ruby gem, there are classes and methods that I’m going to use as an end user of it. If it’s a web app, there are web pages that an end user will see and control in order to use the app. Every software project has interfaces, and they must be carefully documented.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Like everything above, this is also about maintainability. As a new programmer on a project, I will start to learn about it from its interfaces. I should be able to understand what it does and try to use it myself.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I’m talking here about documentation for users, not for developers. In general, I’m against documentation inside the software. Here I totally agree with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://agilemanifesto.org/&quot;&gt;Agile Manifesto&lt;/a&gt;—working software is much more important than comprehensive documentation. But that’s not referring to “external” documentation, which is supposed to be read by users, not developers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So end-user interaction with the software must be clearly documented.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If your software is a library, then its end users are software developers who are going to use it—not contribute to it but simply use it as a “black box.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;hr /&gt; &lt;p&gt;These are the criteria being used to evaluate the open source projects entered in our &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/04/16/award.html&quot;&gt;award&lt;/a&gt; competition.&lt;/p&gt; "/>

href="/2014/10/26/hacker-vs-programmer-mentality.html">most valuable virtue</a> of modern software development. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maintainability">Maintainability</a> can basically be measured as the working time required for a new developer to learn the software before he or she can start making serious changes in it. The longer the time, the lower the maintainability. In some projects, this time requirement is close to infinity, which means it is literally unmaintainable. I believe there are seven fundamental and fatal <strong>sins</strong> that make our software unmaintainable. Here they are.</p><h2 id="anti-patterns">Anti-Patterns</h2><figure class="badge"><img src="https://www.yegor256.com/images/2015/06/software-project-sins-1.gif" style="width:250px;max-width:100%;" alt="badge" /></figure><p>Unfortunately, the programming languages we’re using are too <em>flexible</em>. They allow too much and forbid too little. For example, Java has nothing against you placing the entire application in one single “class” with a few thousand methods. Technically, the application will compile and run. But it’s a well-known anti-pattern called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_object">God object</a>.</p><aside class="youtube"> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtWmlKi3ivc"><div class="box"> <img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZtWmlKi3ivc/mqdefault.jpg" alt="YouTube video #ZtWmlKi3ivc" /><div class="play"><i class="icon icon-play"></i></div></div></a><div>Seven Sins of a Software Project; 16 April 2016.</div></aside><p>Thus, an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-pattern">anti-pattern</a> is a technically acceptable way of designing things that is commonly agreed to be wrong. There are many anti-patterns in each language. Their presence in your product is similar to a tumor in a living organism. Once it starts to grow, it’s very difficult to stop. Eventually, the entire body dies. Eventually, the entire software becomes unmaintainable and has to be re-written.</p><p>Once you let a few anti-patterns in, you will eventually get more of them, and the “tumor” will only grow.</p><p>This is especially true for object-oriented languages (Java, C++, Ruby, and Python), mostly because they inherit so much from procedural languages (C, Fortran, and COBOL). And because <a href="/2016/08/15/what-is-wrong-object-oriented-programming.html">OOP</a> developers tend to think in a procedural and imperative way. Unfortunately.</p><p>By the way, in addition to an existing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-pattern">list of well-known anti-patterns</a>, I also consider <a href="/2014/09/10/anti-patterns-in-oop.html">these few things</a> as rather bad coding approaches.</p><p>My only practical suggestion here is to read and learn. Maybe <a href="/2015/04/22/favorite-software-books.html">these books</a> will help you or my book “<a href="/elegant-objects.html">Elegant Objects</a>.” Always try to be skeptical about the quality of your software, and don’t relax when it “just works.” Like with cancer, the earlier you diagnose it, greater is the chance to survive.</p><h2 id="untraceable-changes">Untraceable Changes</h2><figure class="badge"><img src="https://www.yegor256.com/images/2015/06/software-project-sins-2.gif" style="width:250px;max-width:100%;" alt="badge" /></figure><p>When I look at the commit history, I should be able to tell for every single change <em>what</em> was changed, <em>who</em> made a change, and <em>why</em> the change was made. Moreover, the time required to get those three answers must be measured in seconds. In most projects, this is not the case. Here are a few practical recommendations:</p><p><strong>Always Use Tickets</strong>. No matter how small the project or its team is, even if it’s just yourself, create tickets (GitHub issues) for every problem you’re solving. Explain the problem briefly in the ticket and document your thinking there. Use the ticket as temporary storage for all information related to the problem. Post everything that could make any sense in the future, when someone else will try to understand what those “few strange commits” were about.</p><p><strong>Reference Tickets in Commits</strong>. Needless to say, every commit must have a message. Commits without messages are a very dirty practice; I won’t even discuss why. But just a message is not enough. Every message must start with the number of the ticket you’re working with. GitHub (I’m sure you are using it) will automatically link commits and tickets, increasing <em>traceability</em> of changes.</p><p><strong>Don’t Delete Anything</strong>. Git allows us to do a “forced” push, which overwrites the entire branch that previously existed on the server. This is just one example of how you can destroy the history of development. Many times I’ve also seen people delete their comments in GitHub discussions to make tickets look more “clean.” That’s just wrong. Never delete anything; let your history stay with you, no matter how bad (or messy) it may look to you now.</p><h2 id="ad-hoc-releases">Ad Hoc Releases</h2><figure class="badge"><img src="https://www.yegor256.com/images/2015/06/software-project-sins-3.gif" style="width:250px;max-width:100%;" alt="badge" /></figure><p>Every piece of software must be packaged before it can be delivered to the end user. If it’s a Java library, it has to be packaged as a <code>.jar</code> file and released to some repository; if it’s a web app, it has to be deployed to some platform, etc. No matter how small or big the product is, there is always a standard procedure that tests, packages, and deploys.</p><p>An ideal solution would be to automate this procedure so it is possible to execute it from a command line with a single command:</p><figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span></span>$ ./release.sh

The longer the time, the lower the maintainability. In some projects, this time requirement is close to infinity, which means it is literally unmaintainable. I believe there are seven fundamental and fatal <strong>sins</strong> that make our software unmaintainable.

They allow too much and forbid too little. For example, Java has nothing against you placing the entire application in one single “class” with a few thousand methods. Technically, the application will compile and run. But it’s a well-known anti-pattern called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_object">God object</a>.</p><aside class="youtube"> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtWmlKi3ivc"><div class="box"> <img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZtWmlKi3ivc/mqdefault.jpg" alt="YouTube video #ZtWmlKi3ivc" /><div class="play"><i class="icon icon-play"></i></div></div></a><div>Seven Sins of a Software Project; 16 April 2016.</div></aside><p>Thus, an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-pattern">anti-pattern</a> is a technically acceptable way of designing things that is commonly agreed to be wrong. There are many anti-patterns in each language. Their presence in your product is similar to a tumor in a living organism. Once it starts to grow, it’s very difficult to stop. Eventually, the entire body dies. Eventually, the entire software becomes unmaintainable and has to be re-written.</p><p>Once you let a few anti-patterns in, you will eventually get more of them, and the “tumor” will only grow.</p><p>This is especially true for object-oriented languages (Java, C++, Ruby, and Python), mostly because they inherit so much from procedural languages (C, Fortran, and COBOL). And because <a href="/2016/08/15/what-is-wrong-object-oriented-programming.html">OOP</a> developers tend to think in a procedural and imperative way. Unfortunately.</p><p>By the way, in addition to an existing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-pattern">list of well-known anti-patterns</a>, I also consider <a href="/2014/09/10/anti-patterns-in-oop.html">these few things</a> as rather bad coding approaches.</p><p>My only practical suggestion here is to read and learn. Maybe <a href="/2015/04/22/favorite-software-books.html">these books</a> will help you or my book “<a href="/elegant-objects.html">Elegant Objects</a>.” Always try to be skeptical about the quality of your software, and don’t relax when it “just works.” Like with cancer, the earlier you diagnose it, greater is the chance to survive.</p><h2 id="untraceable-changes">Untraceable Changes</h2><figure class="badge"><img src="https://www.yegor256.com/images/2015/06/software-project-sins-2.gif" style="width:250px;max-width:100%;" alt="badge" /></figure><p>When I look at the commit history, I should be able to tell for every single change <em>what</em> was changed, <em>who</em> made a change, and <em>why</em> the change was made. Moreover, the time required to get those three answers must be measured in seconds. In most projects, this is not the case. Here are a few practical recommendations:</p><p><strong>Always Use Tickets</strong>. No matter how small the project or its team is, even if it’s just yourself, create tickets (GitHub issues) for every problem you’re solving. Explain the problem briefly in the ticket and document your thinking there. Use the ticket as temporary storage for all information related to the problem. Post everything that could make any sense in the future, when someone else will try to understand what those “few strange commits” were about.</p><p><strong>Reference Tickets in Commits</strong>. Needless to say, every commit must have a message. Commits without messages are a very dirty practice; I won’t even discuss why. But just a message is not enough. Every message must start with the number of the ticket you’re working with. GitHub (I’m sure you are using it) will automatically link commits and tickets, increasing <em>traceability</em> of changes.</p><p><strong>Don’t Delete Anything</strong>. Git allows us to do a “forced” push, which overwrites the entire branch that previously existed on the server. This is just one example of how you can destroy the history of development. Many times I’ve also seen people delete their comments in GitHub discussions to make tickets look more “clean.” That’s just wrong. Never delete anything; let your history stay with you, no matter how bad (or messy) it may look to you now.</p><h2 id="ad-hoc-releases">Ad Hoc Releases</h2><figure class="badge"><img src="https://www.yegor256.com/images/2015/06/software-project-sins-3.gif" style="width:250px;max-width:100%;" alt="badge" /></figure><p>Every piece of software must be packaged before it can be delivered to the end user. If it’s a Java library, it has to be packaged as a <code>.jar</code> file and released to some repository; if it’s a web app, it has to be deployed to some platform, etc. No matter how small or big the product is, there is always a standard procedure that tests, packages, and deploys.</p><p>An ideal solution would be to automate this procedure so it is possible to execute it from a command line with a single command:</p><figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span></span>$ ./release.sh
...
DONE <span class="o">(</span>took <span class="m">98</span>.7s<span class="o">)</span></code></pre></figure><p>Most projects are far from that. Their release process always involves some magic, where the person responsible for it (also known as a DevOp) has to click some buttons here and there, login somewhere, check some metrics, etc. Such an <em>ad hoc</em> release process is still a very typical sin of the entire software engineering industry.</p><p>I can give only one practical piece of advice here: Automate it. I use <a href="/2014/09/11/deployment-script-vs-rultor.html">rultor.com</a> for that, but you can use whatever tools you like. What is important is that the entire procedure is fully automated and can be executed from the command line.</p><h2 id="volunteer-static-analysis">Volunteer Static Analysis</h2><figure class="badge"><img src="https://www.yegor256.com/images/2015/06/software-project-sins-4.gif" style="width:250px;max-width:100%;" alt="badge" /></figure><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_program_analysis">Static analysis</a> is what makes our code <em>look</em> better.

My best answer is “&lt;em&gt;I don’t know; it depends.&lt;/em&gt;” Sounds like a strange response for someone who claims he knows what he is doing, doesn’t it? “Here is the 20-page &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/11/10/ten-mistakes-in-specs.html&quot;&gt;specification&lt;/a&gt; that explains all the features of the product; how come you can’t estimate the cost?” I can, but I won’t. Here is why.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;!--more--&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;jb_picture&quot;&gt;&lt;img itemprop=&quot;image&quot; alt=&quot;Interstate 60: Episodes of the Road (2002) by Bob Gale&quot; src=&quot;/images/2015/06/interstate-60.jpg&quot; longdesc=&quot;#e9fa47d8&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption id=&quot;e9fa47d8&quot;&gt;Interstate 60: Episodes of the Road (2002) by Bob Gale&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Let me ask you something else: &lt;em&gt;Why do you need an estimate?&lt;/em&gt; Yes, I mean it—why do you ask me how much it will cost to develop the software for you? I can tell you why.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Because you don’t &lt;a href=&quot;/2017/11/21/trust-pay-lose.html&quot;&gt;trust&lt;/a&gt; me.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Any software, no matter how big or good it is, always needs more and more improvements and bug fixes&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;And obviously you have good reasons for that, simply because we both know that a software product is something that can stay in development forever and never be finished. Look at YouTube, for example. How much do you think it would take to create a website like this, where users are able to upload their videos and then stream them? A few days for a good web developer. Will it stream video? Yes, it will. Will it be ready to compete with YouTube? No, it won’t. Add a few hundred developers to the team, a few years, and a few million dollars, and even then you will be behind YouTube. Simply because it’s a never-ending process. Any software, no matter how big or good it is, always needs more and more improvements and bug fixes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thus, when you ask me how much it will cost to create a system similar to YouTube, according to your specifications, my honest and accurate answer should be: “&lt;em&gt;All of your money, and it won’t be enough.&lt;/em&gt;” Will you sign a contract and &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/10/27/outsourcing-doesnt-work.html&quot;&gt;outsource&lt;/a&gt; the project to me after that answer? No, you won’t. That’s why I have to lie and promise something like “three months and $40,000.” Why would you trust me? If you’re smart enough, you won’t.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;My point is that no matter what I promise you, I will be wrong. Terribly wrong.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What is the solution? What do you do? I totally understand that you do need a number to make your plans and secure the money. You need to choose the right &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/10/27/outsourcing-doesnt-work.html&quot;&gt;software outsourcing&lt;/a&gt; partner, and you need to know what to expect and when, but …&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You’re asking the &lt;em&gt;wrong question&lt;/em&gt;!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This question has only one valid answer, and it’s the answer nobody will ever give you—the development will take forever and will consume all your money. All other answers are simply a lie.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I’m sorry if I’ve delivered bad news to you.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But let’s get back to the original problem: Why are you asking me how much it will take to develop the software if you know it’s a never-ending process and there is basically no limit? Because you want to make sure your $40,000 will be used the right way and will produce the maximum it can produce. To get this assurance from me, you’re asking for an estimate. I’m telling you that your software will be ready for $40K, and you sleep well. Until the moment you realize you’ve been fooled. By your own self.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;The development will take forever and will consume all your money.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;Your concern is perfectly valid. You want to spend no more than $40K, and you want to get a product that will help you achieve your business goals. For example, you want to get into the market and acquire your first few thousand users. In other words, your biggest worry is that your dollars will be turned into the right amount of the right software.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Any software team can consume your $40K, but each team will produce a different &lt;em&gt;amount&lt;/em&gt; of software with different &lt;em&gt;quality&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;My point is that instead of asking how much a software project will cost, you should ask &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/01/19/how-expensive-is-outsourcing.html&quot;&gt;how much software&lt;/a&gt; we can create for each dollar you give us and what quality will it be.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Basically, don’t ask us to estimate how much gas it will take to get to the finish line, because there is no finish line. Instead, ask us how much we charge per gallon and how many gallons we consume per mile.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Different teams use different metrics to measure their results (to be honest, most of them don’t use any). We, at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zerocracy.com&quot;&gt;Zerocracy&lt;/a&gt;, use &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/11/14/hits-of-code.html&quot;&gt;hits of code&lt;/a&gt;, bugs, pull requests, test coverage, and a few other metrics as measurable indicators of &lt;em&gt;quantity and quality&lt;/em&gt;. We know exactly how much software we can produce for each $100 you pay us.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Collect those numbers from other teams and compare them. Also, make sure you can control these numbers during the course of the project. That’s the guarantee you’re looking for. Now you know what you’re buying and how much you’re paying for it. In other words, like I said above, having these numbers in front of you will assure you that your money is producing the maximum &lt;em&gt;amount&lt;/em&gt; of software it can produce, at the highest &lt;em&gt;quality&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The only question left is how you can know you’re buying the &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt; software. In other words, you know how much we charge per gallon and how many gallons we use per mile, but how do you know we’re driving in the right direction and not making too many circles or detours?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There is only one mechanism to guarantee that: regular checkpoints. You should ask us whether we deliver the software in small and regular increments, and whether we allow you to conduct regular &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/12/18/independent-technical-reviews.html&quot;&gt;independent reviews&lt;/a&gt; of our progress. Also, make sure we prioritize our technical goals, use milestones, versionalize releases, publish release notes, etc. Make sure that in the course of our journey, you are able to control the progress and make corrections.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To summarize, this is wrong (because there is no “there”):&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hey driver, how much will it cost to get there?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;And this is right:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hey driver, how much do you charge per mile, and do you have a map?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hope I’ve made my point clear :)&lt;/p&gt; " /> <meta name="keywords" content="next, path, output, content, previous, url, relative_path, id, collection, excerpt, draft, categories, layout, title, date, tags, description, keywords, image, jb_picture, slug, ext" /> <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1"/> <meta name="google-site-verification" content="JEj_gQr2CPe2QKGw8XdMz0R7VboQIUbX3FlM-lwTq-8" /> <meta name="author" content="Yegor Bugayenko"> <meta name="article:published_time" content="2015-06-02 00:00:00 +0000"> <meta name="og:site_name" content="Yegor Bugayenko"/> <meta name="og:type" content="article" /> <meta name="og:locale" content="en_US" /> <meta name="twitter:account_id" content="4503599630178231" /> <meta name="twitter:creator" content="@yegor256"/> <meta name="twitter:site" content="@yegor256"/> <meta name="twitter:title" property="og:title" content="How Much For This Software?"/> <meta name="twitter:description" property="og:description" content="&lt;p&gt;“Here is the specification; how much will it cost to create this software?” I hear this almost every day from &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/01/26/happy-boss-false-objective.html&quot;&gt;clients&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zerocracy.com&quot;&gt;Zerocracy&lt;/a&gt; and prospects that are planning to become our clients and &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/10/27/outsourcing-doesnt-work.html&quot;&gt;outsource&lt;/a&gt; the software development to us. My best answer is “&lt;em&gt;I don’t know; it depends.&lt;/em&gt;” Sounds like a strange response for someone who claims he knows what he is doing, doesn’t it? “Here is the 20-page &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/11/10/ten-mistakes-in-specs.html&quot;&gt;specification&lt;/a&gt; that explains all the features of the product; how come you can’t estimate the cost?” I can, but I won’t. Here is why.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;!--more--&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;jb_picture&quot;&gt;&lt;img itemprop=&quot;image&quot; alt=&quot;Interstate 60: Episodes of the Road (2002) by Bob Gale&quot; src=&quot;/images/2015/06/interstate-60.jpg&quot; longdesc=&quot;#e9fa47d8&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption id=&quot;e9fa47d8&quot;&gt;Interstate 60: Episodes of the Road (2002) by Bob Gale&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Let me ask you something else: &lt;em&gt;Why do you need an estimate?&lt;/em&gt; Yes, I mean it—why do you ask me how much it will cost to develop the software for you? I can tell you why.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Because you don’t &lt;a href=&quot;/2017/11/21/trust-pay-lose.html&quot;&gt;trust&lt;/a&gt; me.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Any software, no matter how big or good it is, always needs more and more improvements and bug fixes&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;And obviously you have good reasons for that, simply because we both know that a software product is something that can stay in development forever and never be finished. Look at YouTube, for example. How much do you think it would take to create a website like this, where users are able to upload their videos and then stream them? A few days for a good web developer. Will it stream video? Yes, it will. Will it be ready to compete with YouTube? No, it won’t. Add a few hundred developers to the team, a few years, and a few million dollars, and even then you will be behind YouTube. Simply because it’s a never-ending process. Any software, no matter how big or good it is, always needs more and more improvements and bug fixes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thus, when you ask me how much it will cost to create a system similar to YouTube, according to your specifications, my honest and accurate answer should be: “&lt;em&gt;All of your money, and it won’t be enough.&lt;/em&gt;” Will you sign a contract and &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/10/27/outsourcing-doesnt-work.html&quot;&gt;outsource&lt;/a&gt; the project to me after that answer? No, you won’t. That’s why I have to lie and promise something like “three months and $40,000.” Why would you trust me? If you’re smart enough, you won’t.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;My point is that no matter what I promise you, I will be wrong. Terribly wrong.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What is the solution? What do you do? I totally understand that you do need a number to make your plans and secure the money. You need to choose the right &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/10/27/outsourcing-doesnt-work.html&quot;&gt;software outsourcing&lt;/a&gt; partner, and you need to know what to expect and when, but …&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You’re asking the &lt;em&gt;wrong question&lt;/em&gt;!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This question has only one valid answer, and it’s the answer nobody will ever give you—the development will take forever and will consume all your money. All other answers are simply a lie.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I’m sorry if I’ve delivered bad news to you.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But let’s get back to the original problem: Why are you asking me how much it will take to develop the software if you know it’s a never-ending process and there is basically no limit? Because you want to make sure your $40,000 will be used the right way and will produce the maximum it can produce. To get this assurance from me, you’re asking for an estimate. I’m telling you that your software will be ready for $40K, and you sleep well. Until the moment you realize you’ve been fooled. By your own self.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;The development will take forever and will consume all your money.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;Your concern is perfectly valid. You want to spend no more than $40K, and you want to get a product that will help you achieve your business goals.

My best answer is “<em>I don’t know; it depends.</em>” Sounds like a strange response for someone who claims he knows what he is doing, doesn’t it? “Here is the 20-page <a href="/2015/11/10/ten-mistakes-in-specs.html">specification</a> that explains all the features of the product; how come you can’t estimate the cost?” I can, but I won’t.

I can tell you why.</p><p>Because you don’t <a href="/2017/11/21/trust-pay-lose.html">trust</a> me.</p><aside class="quote">Any software, no matter how big or good it is, always needs more and more improvements and bug fixes</aside><p>And obviously you have good reasons for that, simply because we both know that a software product is something that can stay in development forever and never be finished. Look at YouTube, for example. How much do you think it would take to create a website like this, where users are able to upload their videos and then stream them? A few days for a good web developer. Will it stream video? Yes, it will. Will it be ready to compete with YouTube? No, it won’t. Add a few hundred developers to the team, a few years, and a few million dollars, and even then you will be behind YouTube. Simply because it’s a never-ending process. Any software, no matter how big or good it is, always needs more and more improvements and bug fixes.</p><p>Thus, when you ask me how much it will cost to create a system similar to YouTube, according to your specifications, my honest and accurate answer should be: “<em>All of your money, and it won’t be enough.</em>” Will you sign a contract and <a href="/2015/10/27/outsourcing-doesnt-work.html">outsource</a> the project to me after that answer? No, you won’t. That’s why I have to lie and promise something like “three months and $40,000.” Why would you trust me? If you’re smart enough, you won’t.</p><p>My point is that no matter what I promise you, I will be wrong. Terribly wrong.</p><p>What is the solution? What do you do? I totally understand that you do need a number to make your plans and secure the money. You need to choose the right <a href="/2015/10/27/outsourcing-doesnt-work.html">software outsourcing</a> partner, and you need to know what to expect and when, but …</p><p>You’re asking the <em>wrong question</em>!</p><p>This question has only one valid answer, and it’s the answer nobody will ever give you—the development will take forever and will consume all your money. All other answers are simply a lie.</p><p>I’m sorry if I’ve delivered bad news to you.</p><p>But let’s get back to the original problem: Why are you asking me how much it will take to develop the software if you know it’s a never-ending process and there is basically no limit? Because you want to make sure your $40,000 will be used the right way and will produce the maximum it can produce. To get this assurance from me, you’re asking for an estimate. I’m telling you that your software will be ready for $40K, and you sleep well. Until the moment you realize you’ve been fooled. By your own self.</p><aside class="quote">The development will take forever and will consume all your money.</aside><p>Your concern is perfectly valid. You want to spend no more than $40K, and you want to get a product that will help you achieve your business goals. For example, you want to get into the market and acquire your first few thousand users. In other words, your biggest worry is that your dollars will be turned into the right amount of the right software.</p><p>Any software team can consume your $40K, but each team will produce a different <em>amount</em> of software with different <em>quality</em>.</p><p>My point is that instead of asking how much a software project will cost, you should ask <a href="/2016/01/19/how-expensive-is-outsourcing.html">how much software</a> we can create for each dollar you give us and what quality will it be.</p><p>Basically, don’t ask us to estimate how much gas it will take to get to the finish line, because there is no finish line. Instead, ask us how much we charge per gallon and how many gallons we consume per mile.</p><p>Different teams use different metrics to measure their results (to be honest, most of them don’t use any). We, at <a href="https://www.zerocracy.com">Zerocracy</a>, use <a href="/2014/11/14/hits-of-code.html">hits of code</a>, bugs, pull requests, test coverage, and a few other metrics as measurable indicators of <em>quantity and quality</em>.

We don’t use meetings, stand-ups, Skype calls, IRC channels, or any other tools where information flies in the air and stays in our heads. Instead, we put everything in writing and talk only when we’re being explicitly asked to and paid to—in tickets.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;bugs&quot;&gt;Bugs&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;With this in mind, a reasonable question may be asked: How can a software architect enforce his or her technical vision for the team if he can’t communicate with the team? Here is our answer: the architect must use &lt;strong&gt;bugs&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Bugs reported by an architect serve as communication channels between him and the team&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;A bug is a ticket that has a reporter, a problem, and a resolver, just like &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/11/24/principles-of-bug-tracking.html&quot;&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt; explains. Say an architect reviews an existing technical solution and finds something that &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/06/22/valid-reasons-to-reject-bug-fix.html&quot;&gt;contradicts&lt;/a&gt; his vision. When such a contradiction is found, it is a good candidate for a bug. Sometimes there is just not enough information in the code yet, and this is also a good candidate for a bug.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thus, bugs reported by an architect serve as &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/08/23/communication-maturity.html&quot;&gt;communication channels&lt;/a&gt; between him and the team. An architect doesn’t explain what needs to be done but asks the team to fix the product in a way he thinks is right. If the ticket resolver, a member of the team, disagrees with that approach, a discussion starts right in the ticket.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;youtube&quot;&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvVQ5NjS_Nk&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;box&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AvVQ5NjS_Nk/mqdefault.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;YouTube video #AvVQ5NjS_Nk&quot; /&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;play&quot;&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;icon icon-play&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;div&gt;Who is a Software Architect? (webinar #13); 13 April 2016.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sometimes an architect has doubts and needs to discuss a few possible solutions with the team or simply collect opinions. Again, we use bugs for that. But these bugs don’t report problems in the source code; instead, they complain about incomplete documentation. For example, say an architect doesn’t know which database to use, MongoDB or Cassandra, and needs more information about their pros and cons. A bug will sound like “our design documentation doesn’t have a detailed comparison of existing NoSQL databases; please fix it.” Whoever is assigned to this ticket will perform the comparison and update the documentation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Bugs are a &lt;em&gt;proactive&lt;/em&gt; tool for an architect. Through reporting bugs, an architect influences the project and “dictates his will.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;reviews&quot;&gt;Reviews&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;In our projects, every ticket is implemented in its own branch. When implementation is done, all tickets pass mandatory code peer review. In other words, developers review each others’ code. An architect is not involved in this process.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Through strict and non-compromising code reviews, an architect enforces his design and architectural principles&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;But when peer review is done, each ticket goes to an architect and he has to give a final “OK” before the code goes to the &lt;code&gt;master&lt;/code&gt; branch through Rultor, our &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/07/24/rultor-automated-merging.html&quot;&gt;merge bot&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is an architect’s opportunity for control. This is where he can prevent his vision from being destroyed. When the code created by a developer violates project design principles or any part of the entire technical idea, the architect says “No” and the branch is rejected.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Reviews are a &lt;em&gt;reactive&lt;/em&gt; instrument for an architect. Through strict and non-compromising code reviews, an architect enforces his design and architectural principles.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;PS. Here is how an architect is supposed to report to the &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/09/22/micromanagement.html&quot;&gt;project manager&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/05/11/software-architect-responsibilities.html&quot;&gt;Three Things I Expect From a Software Architect&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; " /> <meta name="keywords" content="next, path, output, content, previous, url, relative_path, id, collection, excerpt, draft, categories, layout, title, date, tags, description, keywords, image, jb_picture, slug, ext" /> <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1"/> <meta name="google-site-verification" content="JEj_gQr2CPe2QKGw8XdMz0R7VboQIUbX3FlM-lwTq-8" /> <meta name="author" content="Yegor Bugayenko"> <meta name="article:published_time" content="2015-05-13 00:00:00 +0000"> <meta name="og:site_name" content="Yegor Bugayenko"/> <meta name="og:type" content="article" /> <meta name="og:locale" content="en_US" /> <meta name="twitter:account_id" content="4503599630178231" /> <meta name="twitter:creator" content="@yegor256"/> <meta name="twitter:site" content="@yegor256"/> <meta name="twitter:title" property="og:title" content="Two Instruments of a Software Architect"/> <meta name="twitter:description" property="og:description" content="&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/10/12/who-is-software-architect.html&quot;&gt;software architect&lt;/a&gt; is a key person in any software project, no matter how big or small it is.

The architect is personally responsible for the technical quality of the product we’re developing.

Each report includes three mandatory parts: 1) scope status, 2) issues, and 3) risks.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;scope-status&quot;&gt;Scope Status&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;youtube&quot;&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fuEgmibJc4&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;box&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0fuEgmibJc4/mqdefault.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;YouTube video #0fuEgmibJc4&quot; /&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;play&quot;&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;icon icon-play&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;div&gt;Who Is a Software Architect?; 13 April 2015.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;The first and most important type of information I’m looking for is the scope status, which should be presented in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_breakdown_structure&quot;&gt;Product Breakdown Structure&lt;/a&gt; (PBS) format. No matter how complex or how small the product is, a good architect should be able to create a PBS of &lt;em&gt;four to eight items&lt;/em&gt;. For example:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;1.

UI cross-platform testing [none]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;That’s the size of the report I’m expecting to receive from a good architect every few days. The main goal for the architect here is to make sure that nothing is missed. No matter how big the project is, all its technical components must fit into this PBS.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The architect is &lt;em&gt;personally&lt;/em&gt; responsible for not missing the information in the PBS and making it as accurate as possible. If something is missed or the report is delayed, that becomes a good reason to change the architect.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The percentages of progress are also important here. Even though individual tasks are managed with the “0/100 completion principle” in mind, the architect must compile those percentages and make sure that compilation is accurate. Again, a mistake here is unforgivable.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;issues&quot;&gt;Issues&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;youtube&quot;&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNSezrlemsY&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;box&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://i.ytimg.com/vi/PNSezrlemsY/mqdefault.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;YouTube video #PNSezrlemsY&quot; /&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;play&quot;&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;icon icon-play&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;div&gt;Hacker vs Designer Mentality; 13 April 2015.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;The second important part of a regular report from an architect is a list of current issues the development team is facing. An issue is something that has already happened and we’re suffering from it. Here are a few practical examples:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;1. MySQL is too slow for our performance requirements 2. Java 1.6 doesn&amp;#39;t allow us to use library X 3. We don&amp;#39;t have a replacement for a Ruby guy who left us 4. Integration tests are not predictable&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Again, the list must include four to eight items (no more and no less), and the architect should mention the most critical issues there.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;risks&quot;&gt;Risks&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;youtube&quot;&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvVQ5NjS_Nk&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;box&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AvVQ5NjS_Nk/mqdefault.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;YouTube video #AvVQ5NjS_Nk&quot; /&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;play&quot;&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;icon icon-play&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;div&gt;Who is a Software Architect? (webinar #13); 13 April 2016.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now, the risks. A risk is something that hasn’t happened yet but may happen soon, and if it happens, we’ll be in trouble. The architect is responsible for keeping an eye on all potential risks and regularly reporting the most critical ones to the &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/05/24/who-is-project-manager.html&quot;&gt;project manager&lt;/a&gt;. Here is an example of a brief risk report:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;1. Deployment platform may not support Java 8 [3/8] 2. Library X may take more than the two weeks planned [7/3] 3. We may lose a good Ruby developer soon [5/6] 4. Integration tests may not be safe enough [7/2] 5. We may fail to find an open source library [3/8]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;A project manager may require additional information about each risk, but that’s another story. What is most important is to keep the project manager informed about the top of the list. Each risk has two numbers associated with it: &lt;em&gt;probability&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;impact&lt;/em&gt;, from 0 to 9. In the list above, the first risk has a probability of 3 and impact of 8. This means the architect believes that most likely this won’t happen, but if it does happen, we’ll be in big trouble.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Pay attention, as the key word in each risk description is &lt;em&gt;may&lt;/em&gt;. A risk is something that hasn’t happened yet. That’s the biggest difference between a risk and an issue. An issue is a risk that has already occurred.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;PS.

key person in a software project, which I explained in my <a href="/2014/10/12/who-is-software-architect.html">What Does a Software Architect Do?</a> post a few months ago. The architect is personally responsible for the technical quality of the product we’re developing. No matter how good the team is, how complex the technology is, how messy the requirements are, or how chaotic the project sponsor is, we blame the architect and no one else. Of course, we also reward the architect if we succeed.

What is most important is to keep the project manager informed about the top of the list. Each risk has two numbers associated with it: <em>probability</em> and <em>impact</em>, from 0 to 9. In the list above, the first risk has a probability of 3 and impact of 8. This means the architect believes that most likely this won’t happen, but if it does happen, we’ll be in big trouble.</p><p>Pay attention, as the key word in each risk description is <em>may</em>.

Even when they do have glossaries, their definitions of terms are very vague and ambiguous. Why is this happening? Don’t we understand the importance of a common vocabulary for any software project? I’m not sure what the causes are, but this is what a software architect should do when he or she starts a project—create a glossary.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;!--more--&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;jb_picture&quot;&gt;&lt;img itemprop=&quot;image&quot; alt=&quot;Pulp Fiction (1994) by Quentin Tarantino&quot; src=&quot;/images/2015/03/pulp-fiction.jpg&quot; longdesc=&quot;#f3384ab3&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption id=&quot;f3384ab3&quot;&gt;Pulp Fiction (1994) by Quentin Tarantino&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;I’m trying to write something unique about this subject, but everything I can say is so obvious that I doubt anyone would be interested in reading it. Anyway, I will try.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;A detailed and accurate glossary saves a reader a lot of time&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;A glossary (a.k.a. vocabulary) is a list of terms used by the project that is usually included at the beginning of the technical specification document. Ideally, every technical term used in the document should be briefly explained in the glossary. The existence of a glossary helps everyone who works with the document quickly understand each other and avoid misconceptions. On top of this, a detailed and accurate glossary saves a reader a lot of time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So why are glossaries not written? I see a few possible causes (usually, they are combined):&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We’re Smarter Than This&lt;/strong&gt;. Some people think glossaries are for newbies. After all, why would I explain what a PDU is? Any serious network engineer should understand that it stands for “protocol data unit.” If you don’t understand it, do your homework and then come back to work with us. Our team only works with well-educated engineers. You’re supposed to understand what PDU, ADC, TxR, IPv6, DPI, FIFO, and USSR (joking!) stand for. Otherwise, you’re not talented enough to be with us. Needless to say, this attitude can only come from those who have no idea what they are doing. A good engineer always remembers that if the receiver doesn’t understand a message, it’s the sender’s fault.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We Don’t Need These Formalities&lt;/strong&gt;. Seriously, why would we spend time on writing a glossary if everybody understands all our terms without it? We’ve been working as a team for a few years, so we all know what DPI and FIFO are, and we know what “record” and “timing data” are. Why bother with the glossary, which will provide no additional business value for us? I’ve seen many technical meetings of very mature and “well-organized” teams burn hours of time on pointless discussions simply because of different understandings the same term. A glossary is not a formality; it’s a key instrument of a software architect and all other team members.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;A good engineer always remembers that if the receiver doesn't understand a message, it's the sender's fault&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We Prefer Working Software Over Comprehensive Documentation&lt;/strong&gt;. This is what the &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/07/11/mistakes-in-agile-manifesto.html&quot;&gt;Agile Manifesto&lt;/a&gt; says, and it’s true. But the key word here is “comprehensive.” We don’t need comprehensive documentation, but we need a glossary. It’s a key element in any project, and it simply can’t be replaced by working software. No working software can help us understand what “header” and “data signal” are unless there is a simple and clear statement about it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We Don’t Have Time&lt;/strong&gt;. We’re developing too fast and brainstorming every day, so the concept is frequently changing. We simply don’t have time to document our thoughts. We all understand each other, and that is the beauty of being agile. No, that is not a beauty. Instead, it is a lack of discipline and elementary management skill. A lack of a glossary is a personal fault of the software architect, and there are no excuses for it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All Our Terms Are Well-Known to Everyone&lt;/strong&gt;. Seriously, do we need to document what TCP/IP and FIFO are? That’s what they teach us in school. Everyone understands that, don’t they? Yes, some of the terms are well-known.

Even when they do have glossaries, their definitions of terms are very vague and ambiguous. Why is this happening? Don’t we understand the importance of a common vocabulary for any software project? I’m not sure what the causes are, but this is what a software architect should do when he or she starts a project—create a glossary.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;!--more--&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;jb_picture&quot;&gt;&lt;img itemprop=&quot;image&quot; alt=&quot;Pulp Fiction (1994) by Quentin Tarantino&quot; src=&quot;/images/2015/03/pulp-fiction.jpg&quot; longdesc=&quot;#f3384ab3&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption id=&quot;f3384ab3&quot;&gt;Pulp Fiction (1994) by Quentin Tarantino&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;I’m trying to write something unique about this subject, but everything I can say is so obvious that I doubt anyone would be interested in reading it. Anyway, I will try.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;A detailed and accurate glossary saves a reader a lot of time&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;A glossary (a.k.a. vocabulary) is a list of terms used by the project that is usually included at the beginning of the technical specification document. Ideally, every technical term used in the document should be briefly explained in the glossary. The existence of a glossary helps everyone who works with the document quickly understand each other and avoid misconceptions. On top of this, a detailed and accurate glossary saves a reader a lot of time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So why are glossaries not written? I see a few possible causes (usually, they are combined):&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We’re Smarter Than This&lt;/strong&gt;. Some people think glossaries are for newbies. After all, why would I explain what a PDU is? Any serious network engineer should understand that it stands for “protocol data unit.” If you don’t understand it, do your homework and then come back to work with us. Our team only works with well-educated engineers. You’re supposed to understand what PDU, ADC, TxR, IPv6, DPI, FIFO, and USSR (joking!) stand for. Otherwise, you’re not talented enough to be with us. Needless to say, this attitude can only come from those who have no idea what they are doing. A good engineer always remembers that if the receiver doesn’t understand a message, it’s the sender’s fault.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We Don’t Need These Formalities&lt;/strong&gt;. Seriously, why would we spend time on writing a glossary if everybody understands all our terms without it? We’ve been working as a team for a few years, so we all know what DPI and FIFO are, and we know what “record” and “timing data” are. Why bother with the glossary, which will provide no additional business value for us? I’ve seen many technical meetings of very mature and “well-organized” teams burn hours of time on pointless discussions simply because of different understandings the same term. A glossary is not a formality; it’s a key instrument of a software architect and all other team members.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;A good engineer always remembers that if the receiver doesn't understand a message, it's the sender's fault&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We Prefer Working Software Over Comprehensive Documentation&lt;/strong&gt;. This is what the &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/07/11/mistakes-in-agile-manifesto.html&quot;&gt;Agile Manifesto&lt;/a&gt; says, and it’s true. But the key word here is “comprehensive.” We don’t need comprehensive documentation, but we need a glossary. It’s a key element in any project, and it simply can’t be replaced by working software. No working software can help us understand what “header” and “data signal” are unless there is a simple and clear statement about it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We Don’t Have Time&lt;/strong&gt;. We’re developing too fast and brainstorming every day, so the concept is frequently changing. We simply don’t have time to document our thoughts. We all understand each other, and that is the beauty of being agile. No, that is not a beauty. Instead, it is a lack of discipline and elementary management skill. A lack of a glossary is a personal fault of the software architect, and there are no excuses for it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All Our Terms Are Well-Known to Everyone&lt;/strong&gt;. Seriously, do we need to document what TCP/IP and FIFO are? That’s what they teach us in school. Everyone understands that, don’t they? Yes, some of the terms are well-known.

The first and most important quality of a good manager is his or her ability to separate bad apples from good ones as soon as possible. Nothing will earn you more disrespect from your team than tolerance of &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/10/13/competition-without-rules.html&quot;&gt;under-performing&lt;/a&gt; team members. Your job as a manager is to help the best players play better, and they can’t play better if they see that management doesn’t understand the difference between excellence and mediocrity. It’s a severe demotivating factor.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;youtube&quot;&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibT5oKToMoQ&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;box&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ibT5oKToMoQ/mqdefault.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;YouTube video #ibT5oKToMoQ&quot; /&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;play&quot;&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;icon icon-play&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;div&gt;Daily Stand-Up Meetings Are Evil (webinar #11); 3 February 2016.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be Honest About Problems and Risks&lt;/strong&gt;. Your team is following you and expecting you to be a smart manager. While they are writing Java, you’re talking to investors and customers. They want to be sure you know what you’re doing. The best way to show them you have no idea where the team is going is to tell them that the future is bright and cloudless. Everybody understands that’s either a lie and you are trying to hide risks or you’re stupid enough to not see them. In either case, the best people would attempt to quit before it’s too late. Thus, to keep morale up, &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/05/21/avoid-software-outsourcing-disaster.html&quot;&gt;regularly inform&lt;/a&gt; your people about problems you’re facing and risks you’re trying to prevent. They will appreciate it and respect you. A strong, professional manager deals with risks instead of ignoring them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;A strong manager isn't afraid to look stupid in front of the team&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Failures Are Yours; Success Is Theirs&lt;/strong&gt;. Always remember that when someone on your team makes a mistake, it is first of all &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; personal mistake. You hired that person, you trained him or her, you delegated the responsibility, and you controlled and monitored the job. Then he made a mistake, and the project lost money, disappointed a customer, or damaged the firm’s reputation. Of course you need to take necessary disciplinary actions and maybe &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/09/16/how-to-fire-someone-right.html&quot;&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt; the troublemaker. But first of all, you have to admit in front of everyone that it was &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; personal mistake. You didn’t control enough, you didn’t &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/05/24/who-is-project-manager.html&quot;&gt;plan&lt;/a&gt; well, or you didn’t take preventive actions. This is what the team expects from you. Also, your people expect you to explain to them how you’re going to learn from this mistake in order to prevent a similar one from happening in the future. A strong manager isn’t afraid to look stupid in front of the team. A weak manager does look stupid when he or she tries to hide mistakes that have been made.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Responsibility Is Always Personal&lt;/strong&gt;. The most demotivating word used in task descriptions is “together.” Don’t use it. Each task has to be personally and individually assigned (no matter what the &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/07/11/mistakes-in-agile-manifesto.html&quot;&gt;Agile Manifesto&lt;/a&gt; says). Everybody is responsible for his or her own success or failure. How their results join together and lead to a mutual success or failure—that’s &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/05/24/who-is-project-manager.html&quot;&gt;business&lt;/a&gt;. Whether you succeed or fail, we all will see. Once you say we all have to succeed &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/11/21/ringelmann-effect-vs-agile.html&quot;&gt;together&lt;/a&gt;, the team understands that you’re trying to shift responsibility from your own shoulders to theirs. It’s a sign of weakness, and you lose respect. Make tasks and goals strictly personal, and be prepared to be responsible for the group’s success. You, as a manager, break down an entire project into parts and delegate them to your people. If you do this job properly, we all will succeed. But don’t try to blame us if the parts fall apart.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;youtube&quot;&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biE86esgFAE&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;box&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://i.ytimg.com/vi/biE86esgFAE/mqdefault.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;YouTube video #biE86esgFAE&quot; /&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;play&quot;&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;icon icon-play&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;div&gt;Seven Enemies of Our Motivation (in Russian with English subtitles); 25 March 2017.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t Mention Steve Jobs&lt;/strong&gt;. Try to avoid global slogans and world domination speeches in the office and in front of the team. They demotivate. If we’re doing so good, why are our salaries not reflecting this success yet? If your vision is so global, why is it not yet implemented in reality? Don’t promise to become the next Steve Jobs. Instead, become the next &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/09/22/micromanagement.html&quot;&gt;good manager&lt;/a&gt; of a highly paid team that is solving interesting problems for real people. Your practical achievements, no matter how small and down-to-earth they are, will give you much more respect than many-hour-long speeches about our fantastic future.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t Say a Word About Agile&lt;/strong&gt;. Even though &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/07/11/mistakes-in-agile-manifesto.html&quot;&gt;Agile&lt;/a&gt; is a great attitude-changing and mind-shifting concept, it is absolutely inapplicable in practice, mostly because it is too abstract. When you’re proclaiming in the office that we should value “working software over comprehensive documentation,” it sounds like you don’t know what you’re doing. The team doesn’t need such abstract slogans from you. It needs specific instructions and rules in order to follow them and produce results, money, and satisfaction. Agile is a set of abstract principles that you should understand and digest. But then, after you chew them properly, convert them to specific and very unambiguous rules of work. Don’t talk about Agile; be agile.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Give everybody an assurance that none of them will be terminated behind a closed door&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t Close the Door&lt;/strong&gt;. Responsibility is personal, &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/09/24/why-monetary-awards-dont-work.html&quot;&gt;money&lt;/a&gt; is personal, and results are personal. But their discussions should be open to everybody. Don’t close the door to that meeting room when you’re talking about problems or appraising someone’s results. You want your team to work together? Give everybody an assurance that none of them will be &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/09/16/how-to-fire-someone-right.html&quot;&gt;terminated&lt;/a&gt; behind a closed door. These pompous speeches about “us working together” usually turn into mush once the team sees that someone gets fired after a private conversation with a manager. Are we together, or is it you against us? To keep team morale up, you, as a manager, have to establish &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/10/13/competition-without-rules.html&quot;&gt;ground rules&lt;/a&gt; of work that will define who gets what when we succeed and who &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/09/16/how-to-fire-someone-right.html&quot;&gt;goes home&lt;/a&gt; first when we fail. These rules should be open to everybody. These rules should rule the team, not your personal decisions made behind a closed door.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Celebrate Achievements Instead of Birthdays&lt;/strong&gt;. Team-building events are a great tool to boost team morale, but only when they are built around personal or team achievements instead of calendar events. A project team is &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/02/18/holacracy-autocracy.html&quot;&gt;not a group of friends&lt;/a&gt; or family members, even though some teams may feel like that. No matter how it feels, a team is here for one reason—to create the product and make money for its sponsor. This is the direction we’re going. Our goal is not to build a community and live together til the end of our days. Our goal is to achieve the business success of the product we’re developing, or in other words, complete the project. When the only events we’re celebrating are our birthdays, that’s a sign to us that our managers are trying to lie to us. They are pretending that we’re here to make a community of friends while in reality they are using us to build their business. It’s unhealthy and ruins team morale. Instead, celebrate achievements on your real path—to the success of the product under development. This will show everybody that you, as a manager, are honest with your people and ready to show them that their true role on the team is to develop a product and earn money for its investors. Honesty is the best team morale booster.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Honesty is the best team morale booster&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t Rule; Make Rules and Plans&lt;/strong&gt;. Nothing demotivates more than an unpredictable &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/05/24/who-is-project-manager.html&quot;&gt;manager&lt;/a&gt;. For the team, you are an abstraction of the entire world around the team. They see the reality through the prism of your personality. What you tell them about the reality is what they perceive. If you are unpredictable, the reality is unpredictable and scary for them. To avoid that, stop making decisions that are based on your personal and momentary judgment. Instead, make decisions that are based on the rules you’ve defined upfront and plans you’ve drawn beforehand. First, create a plan for team growth and announce it to everybody. The plan should include risks and their mitigation actions. The plan should say who will be fired first when or if the project goes down. The plan should give a predictable and measurable picture of the reality around your office. It should be a map of terrain you’re going to cross with your team. When it’s time to make a decision, everybody will understand why it’s made and will respect you as a manager who predicted the situation and managed it professionally.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Everybody should know everybody's salaries, bonuses, and benefits&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Put Money on the Table&lt;/strong&gt;. Discuss money openly and freely, right in the office, right in front of everybody. This advice is for true professionals. If you can’t do what is said above, don’t even try this one. But if you consider yourself a real pro in management and leadership, you should put money on the table and let everybody know who is getting what, when, why, and why not. Everybody should know everybody’s salaries, bonuses, benefits, and the rationale behind them. Each programmer should know what he or she should do in order to get a $5,000 raise to their annual salary. Also, he or she should know why a colleague is called “senior developer” while his or her title is still “junior.” This information should be public and printed on the wall right behind your chair. Why don’t most managers do this? Because they don’t have any &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/09/24/why-monetary-awards-dont-work.html&quot;&gt;rationale&lt;/a&gt; behind their monetary decisions. Instead of managing the money, they let money manage them.&lt;/p&gt; " /> <meta name="keywords" content="next, path, output, content, previous, url, relative_path, id, collection, excerpt, draft, categories, layout, title, date, tags, description, keywords, related, social, image, jb_picture, buffer, slug, ext" /> <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1"/> <meta name="google-site-verification" content="JEj_gQr2CPe2QKGw8XdMz0R7VboQIUbX3FlM-lwTq-8" /> <meta name="author" content="Yegor Bugayenko"> <meta name="article:published_time" content="2015-03-02 00:00:00 +0000"> <meta name="og:site_name" content="Yegor Bugayenko"/> <meta name="og:type" content="article" /> <meta name="og:locale" content="en_US" /> <meta name="twitter:account_id" content="4503599630178231" /> <meta name="twitter:creator" content="@yegor256"/> <meta name="twitter:site" content="@yegor256"/> <meta name="twitter:title" property="og:title" content="Team Morale: Myths and Reality"/> <meta name="twitter:description" property="og:description" content="&lt;p&gt;There are plenty of books, articles, and blog posts about &lt;em&gt;team morale&lt;/em&gt;.

These pompous speeches about “us working together” usually turn into mush once the team sees that someone gets fired after a private conversation with a manager. Are we together, or is it you against us? To keep team morale up, you, as a manager, have to establish &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/10/13/competition-without-rules.html&quot;&gt;ground rules&lt;/a&gt; of work that will define who gets what when we succeed and who &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/09/16/how-to-fire-someone-right.html&quot;&gt;goes home&lt;/a&gt; first when we fail. These rules should be open to everybody. These rules should rule the team, not your personal decisions made behind a closed door.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Celebrate Achievements Instead of Birthdays&lt;/strong&gt;. Team-building events are a great tool to boost team morale, but only when they are built around personal or team achievements instead of calendar events. A project team is &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/02/18/holacracy-autocracy.html&quot;&gt;not a group of friends&lt;/a&gt; or family members, even though some teams may feel like that. No matter how it feels, a team is here for one reason—to create the product and make money for its sponsor. This is the direction we’re going. Our goal is not to build a community and live together til the end of our days. Our goal is to achieve the business success of the product we’re developing, or in other words, complete the project. When the only events we’re celebrating are our birthdays, that’s a sign to us that our managers are trying to lie to us. They are pretending that we’re here to make a community of friends while in reality they are using us to build their business. It’s unhealthy and ruins team morale. Instead, celebrate achievements on your real path—to the success of the product under development. This will show everybody that you, as a manager, are honest with your people and ready to show them that their true role on the team is to develop a product and earn money for its investors. Honesty is the best team morale booster.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Honesty is the best team morale booster&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t Rule; Make Rules and Plans&lt;/strong&gt;. Nothing demotivates more than an unpredictable &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/05/24/who-is-project-manager.html&quot;&gt;manager&lt;/a&gt;. For the team, you are an abstraction of the entire world around the team. They see the reality through the prism of your personality. What you tell them about the reality is what they perceive. If you are unpredictable, the reality is unpredictable and scary for them. To avoid that, stop making decisions that are based on your personal and momentary judgment. Instead, make decisions that are based on the rules you’ve defined upfront and plans you’ve drawn beforehand. First, create a plan for team growth and announce it to everybody. The plan should include risks and their mitigation actions. The plan should say who will be fired first when or if the project goes down. The plan should give a predictable and measurable picture of the reality around your office. It should be a map of terrain you’re going to cross with your team. When it’s time to make a decision, everybody will understand why it’s made and will respect you as a manager who predicted the situation and managed it professionally.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Everybody should know everybody's salaries, bonuses, and benefits&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Put Money on the Table&lt;/strong&gt;. Discuss money openly and freely, right in the office, right in front of everybody. This advice is for true professionals. If you can’t do what is said above, don’t even try this one. But if you consider yourself a real pro in management and leadership, you should put money on the table and let everybody know who is getting what, when, why, and why not. Everybody should know everybody’s salaries, bonuses, benefits, and the rationale behind them. Each programmer should know what he or she should do in order to get a $5,000 raise to their annual salary. Also, he or she should know why a colleague is called “senior developer” while his or her title is still “junior.” This information should be public and printed on the wall right behind your chair. Why don’t most managers do this? Because they don’t have any &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/09/24/why-monetary-awards-dont-work.html&quot;&gt;rationale&lt;/a&gt; behind their monetary decisions. Instead of managing the money, they let money manage them.&lt;/p&gt; "/> <meta name="twitter:url" property="og:url" content="https://www.yegor256.com/2015/03/02/team-morale-myths-and-reality.html"/>

<em>team morale</em>. They will all suggest you do things like regular celebrations, team events, free lunches, pet-friendly offices, coffee machines, birthday presents, etc. All of these are instruments of <a href="/2015/10/06/how-to-be-good-office-slave.html"><strong>concealed enslaving</strong></a>. These traditional techniques turn employees into speechless monkeys, programming under the influence of Prozac. Their existence and <a href="/2015/10/16/ridley-scott-and-joseph-goebbels.html">popularity</a> is our big misfortune. Let me present my own vision of how team morale can be boosted on a software team—a team that has a good <a href="/2015/09/22/micromanagement.html">project manager</a>.</p><figure class="jb_picture"><img itemprop="image" alt="Apocalypto (2006) by Mel Gibson" src="/images/2015/03/apocalypto.jpg" longdesc="#36143267" /><figcaption id="36143267">Apocalypto (2006) by Mel Gibson</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Fire Fast</strong>. The first and most important quality of a good manager is his or her ability to separate bad apples from good ones as soon as possible. Nothing will earn you more disrespect from your team than tolerance of <a href="/2015/10/13/competition-without-rules.html">under-performing</a> team members. Your job as a manager is to help the best players play better, and they can’t play better if they see that management doesn’t understand the difference between excellence and mediocrity. It’s a severe demotivating factor.</p><aside class="youtube"> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibT5oKToMoQ"><div class="box"> <img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ibT5oKToMoQ/mqdefault.jpg" alt="YouTube video #ibT5oKToMoQ" /><div class="play"><i class="icon icon-play"></i></div></div></a><div>Daily Stand-Up Meetings Are Evil (webinar #11); 3 February 2016.</div></aside><p><strong>Be Honest About Problems and Risks</strong>. Your team is following you and expecting you to be a smart manager. While they are writing Java, you’re talking to investors and customers. They want to be sure you know what you’re doing. The best way to show them you have no idea where the team is going is to tell them that the future is bright and cloudless. Everybody understands that’s either a lie and you are trying to hide risks or you’re stupid enough to not see them. In either case, the best people would attempt to quit before it’s too late. Thus, to keep morale up, <a href="/2015/05/21/avoid-software-outsourcing-disaster.html">regularly inform</a> your people about problems you’re facing and risks you’re trying to prevent. They will appreciate it and respect you. A strong, professional manager deals with risks instead of ignoring them.</p><aside class="quote">A strong manager isn't afraid to look stupid in front of the team</aside><p><strong>Failures Are Yours; Success Is Theirs</strong>. Always remember that when someone on your team makes a mistake, it is first of all <em>your</em> personal mistake. You hired that person, you trained him or her, you delegated the responsibility, and you controlled and monitored the job. Then he made a mistake, and the project lost money, disappointed a customer, or damaged the firm’s reputation. Of course you need to take necessary disciplinary actions and maybe <a href="/2015/09/16/how-to-fire-someone-right.html">fire</a> the troublemaker. But first of all, you have to admit in front of everyone that it was <em>your</em> personal mistake. You didn’t control enough, you didn’t <a href="/2016/05/24/who-is-project-manager.html">plan</a> well, or you didn’t take preventive actions. This is what the team expects from you. Also, your people expect you to explain to them how you’re going to learn from this mistake in order to prevent a similar one from happening in the future. A strong manager isn’t afraid to look stupid in front of the team. A weak manager does look stupid when he or she tries to hide mistakes that have been made.</p><p><strong>Responsibility Is Always Personal</strong>. The most demotivating word used in task descriptions is “together.” Don’t use it. Each task has to be personally and individually assigned (no matter what the <a href="/2016/07/11/mistakes-in-agile-manifesto.html">Agile Manifesto</a> says). Everybody is responsible for his or her own success or failure. How their results join together and lead to a mutual success or failure—that’s <em>your</em> <a href="/2016/05/24/who-is-project-manager.html">business</a>. Whether you succeed or fail, we all will see. Once you say we all have to succeed <a href="/2015/11/21/ringelmann-effect-vs-agile.html">together</a>, the team understands that you’re trying to shift responsibility from your own shoulders to theirs. It’s a sign of weakness, and you lose respect. Make tasks and goals strictly personal, and be prepared to be responsible for the group’s success. You, as a manager, break down an entire project into parts and delegate them to your people. If you do this job properly, we all will succeed. But don’t try to blame us if the parts fall apart.</p><aside class="youtube"> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biE86esgFAE"><div class="box"> <img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/biE86esgFAE/mqdefault.jpg" alt="YouTube video #biE86esgFAE" /><div class="play"><i class="icon icon-play"></i></div></div></a><div>Seven Enemies of Our Motivation (in Russian with English subtitles); 25 March 2017.</div></aside><p><strong>Don’t Mention Steve Jobs</strong>. Try to avoid global slogans and world domination speeches in the office and in front of the team. They demotivate. If we’re doing so good, why are our salaries not reflecting this success yet? If your vision is so global, why is it not yet implemented in reality? Don’t promise to become the next Steve Jobs. Instead, become the next <a href="/2015/09/22/micromanagement.html">good manager</a> of a highly paid team that is solving interesting problems for real people. Your practical achievements, no matter how small and down-to-earth they are, will give you much more respect than many-hour-long speeches about our fantastic future.</p><p><strong>Don’t Say a Word About Agile</strong>. Even though <a href="/2016/07/11/mistakes-in-agile-manifesto.html">Agile</a> is a great attitude-changing and mind-shifting concept, it is absolutely inapplicable in practice, mostly because it is too abstract. When you’re proclaiming in the office that we should value “working software over comprehensive documentation,” it sounds like you don’t know what you’re doing. The team doesn’t need such abstract slogans from you. It needs specific instructions and rules in order to follow them and produce results, money, and satisfaction. Agile is a set of abstract principles that you should understand and digest. But then, after you chew them properly, convert them to specific and very unambiguous rules of work. Don’t talk about Agile; be agile.</p><aside class="quote">Give everybody an assurance that none of them will be terminated behind a closed door</aside><p><strong>Don’t Close the Door</strong>. Responsibility is personal, <a href="/2014/09/24/why-monetary-awards-dont-work.html">money</a> is personal, and results are personal. But their discussions should be open to everybody. Don’t close the door to that meeting room when you’re talking about problems or appraising someone’s results. You want your team to work together? Give everybody an assurance that none of them will be <a href="/2015/09/16/how-to-fire-someone-right.html">terminated</a> behind a closed door.

Their existence and <a href="/2015/10/16/ridley-scott-and-joseph-goebbels.html">popularity</a> is our big misfortune. Let me present my own vision of how team morale can be boosted on a software team—a team that has a good <a href="/2015/09/22/micromanagement.html">project manager</a>.</p><figure class="jb_picture"><img itemprop="image" alt="Apocalypto (2006) by Mel Gibson" src="/images/2015/03/apocalypto.jpg" longdesc="#36143267" /><figcaption id="36143267">Apocalypto (2006) by Mel Gibson</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Fire Fast</strong>. The first and most important quality of a good manager is his or her ability to separate bad apples from good ones as soon as possible. Nothing will earn you more disrespect from your team than tolerance of <a href="/2015/10/13/competition-without-rules.html">under-performing</a> team members. Your job as a manager is to help the best players play better, and they can’t play better if they see that management doesn’t understand the difference between excellence and mediocrity. It’s a severe demotivating factor.</p><aside class="youtube"> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibT5oKToMoQ"><div class="box"> <img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ibT5oKToMoQ/mqdefault.jpg" alt="YouTube video #ibT5oKToMoQ" /><div class="play"><i class="icon icon-play"></i></div></div></a><div>Daily Stand-Up Meetings Are Evil (webinar #11); 3 February 2016.</div></aside><p><strong>Be Honest About Problems and Risks</strong>. Your team is following you and expecting you to be a smart manager. While they are writing Java, you’re talking to investors and customers. They want to be sure you know what you’re doing. The best way to show them you have no idea where the team is going is to tell them that the future is bright and cloudless. Everybody understands that’s either a lie and you are trying to hide risks or you’re stupid enough to not see them. In either case, the best people would attempt to quit before it’s too late. Thus, to keep morale up, <a href="/2015/05/21/avoid-software-outsourcing-disaster.html">regularly inform</a> your people about problems you’re facing and risks you’re trying to prevent. They will appreciate it and respect you. A strong, professional manager deals with risks instead of ignoring them.</p><aside class="quote">A strong manager isn't afraid to look stupid in front of the team</aside><p><strong>Failures Are Yours; Success Is Theirs</strong>. Always remember that when someone on your team makes a mistake, it is first of all <em>your</em> personal mistake. You hired that person, you trained him or her, you delegated the responsibility, and you controlled and monitored the job. Then he made a mistake, and the project lost money, disappointed a customer, or damaged the firm’s reputation. Of course you need to take necessary disciplinary actions and maybe <a href="/2015/09/16/how-to-fire-someone-right.html">fire</a> the troublemaker. But first of all, you have to admit in front of everyone that it was <em>your</em> personal mistake. You didn’t control enough, you didn’t <a href="/2016/05/24/who-is-project-manager.html">plan</a> well, or you didn’t take preventive actions. This is what the team expects from you. Also, your people expect you to explain to them how you’re going to learn from this mistake in order to prevent a similar one from happening in the future. A strong manager isn’t afraid to look stupid in front of the team. A weak manager does look stupid when he or she tries to hide mistakes that have been made.</p><p><strong>Responsibility Is Always Personal</strong>. The most demotivating word used in task descriptions is “together.” Don’t use it. Each task has to be personally and individually assigned (no matter what the <a href="/2016/07/11/mistakes-in-agile-manifesto.html">Agile Manifesto</a> says). Everybody is responsible for his or her own success or failure. How their results join together and lead to a mutual success or failure—that’s <em>your</em> <a href="/2016/05/24/who-is-project-manager.html">business</a>. Whether you succeed or fail, we all will see. Once you say we all have to succeed <a href="/2015/11/21/ringelmann-effect-vs-agile.html">together</a>, the team understands that you’re trying to shift responsibility from your own shoulders to theirs. It’s a sign of weakness, and you lose respect. Make tasks and goals strictly personal, and be prepared to be responsible for the group’s success. You, as a manager, break down an entire project into parts and delegate them to your people. If you do this job properly, we all will succeed. But don’t try to blame us if the parts fall apart.</p><aside class="youtube"> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biE86esgFAE"><div class="box"> <img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/biE86esgFAE/mqdefault.jpg" alt="YouTube video #biE86esgFAE" /><div class="play"><i class="icon icon-play"></i></div></div></a><div>Seven Enemies of Our Motivation (in Russian with English subtitles); 25 March 2017.</div></aside><p><strong>Don’t Mention Steve Jobs</strong>. Try to avoid global slogans and world domination speeches in the office and in front of the team. They demotivate. If we’re doing so good, why are our salaries not reflecting this success yet? If your vision is so global, why is it not yet implemented in reality? Don’t promise to become the next Steve Jobs. Instead, become the next <a href="/2015/09/22/micromanagement.html">good manager</a> of a highly paid team that is solving interesting problems for real people. Your practical achievements, no matter how small and down-to-earth they are, will give you much more respect than many-hour-long speeches about our fantastic future.</p><p><strong>Don’t Say a Word About Agile</strong>. Even though <a href="/2016/07/11/mistakes-in-agile-manifesto.html">Agile</a> is a great attitude-changing and mind-shifting concept, it is absolutely inapplicable in practice, mostly because it is too abstract. When you’re proclaiming in the office that we should value “working software over comprehensive documentation,” it sounds like you don’t know what you’re doing. The team doesn’t need such abstract slogans from you. It needs specific instructions and rules in order to follow them and produce results, money, and satisfaction. Agile is a set of abstract principles that you should understand and digest. But then, after you chew them properly, convert them to specific and very unambiguous rules of work. Don’t talk about Agile; be agile.</p><aside class="quote">Give everybody an assurance that none of them will be terminated behind a closed door</aside><p><strong>Don’t Close the Door</strong>. Responsibility is personal, <a href="/2014/09/24/why-monetary-awards-dont-work.html">money</a> is personal, and results are personal. But their discussions should be open to everybody. Don’t close the door to that meeting room when you’re talking about problems or appraising someone’s results. You want your team to work together? Give everybody an assurance that none of them will be <a href="/2015/09/16/how-to-fire-someone-right.html">terminated</a> behind a closed door. These pompous speeches about “us working together” usually turn into mush once the team sees that someone gets fired after a private conversation with a manager. Are we together, or is it you against us? To keep team morale up, you, as a manager, have to establish <a href="/2015/10/13/competition-without-rules.html">ground rules</a> of work that will define who gets what when we succeed and who <a href="/2015/09/16/how-to-fire-someone-right.html">goes home</a> first when we fail. These rules should be open to everybody. These rules should rule the team, not your personal decisions made behind a closed door.</p><p><strong>Celebrate Achievements Instead of Birthdays</strong>. Team-building events are a great tool to boost team morale, but only when they are built around personal or team achievements instead of calendar events. A project team is <a href="/2016/02/18/holacracy-autocracy.html">not a group of friends</a> or family members, even though some teams may feel like that. No matter how it feels, a team is here for one reason—to create the product and make money for its sponsor. This is the direction we’re going. Our goal is not to build a community and live together til the end of our days. Our goal is to achieve the business success of the product we’re developing, or in other words, complete the project. When the only events we’re celebrating are our birthdays, that’s a sign to us that our managers are trying to lie to us. They are pretending that we’re here to make a community of friends while in reality they are using us to build their business. It’s unhealthy and ruins team morale. Instead, celebrate achievements on your real path—to the success of the product under development. This will show everybody that you, as a manager, are honest with your people and ready to show them that their true role on the team is to develop a product and earn money for its investors. Honesty is the best team morale booster.</p><aside class="quote">Honesty is the best team morale booster</aside><p><strong>Don’t Rule; Make Rules and Plans</strong>. Nothing demotivates more than an unpredictable <a href="/2016/05/24/who-is-project-manager.html">manager</a>. For the team, you are an abstraction of the entire world around the team. They see the reality through the prism of your personality. What you tell them about the reality is what they perceive. If you are unpredictable, the reality is unpredictable and scary for them. To avoid that, stop making decisions that are based on your personal and momentary judgment. Instead, make decisions that are based on the rules you’ve defined upfront and plans you’ve drawn beforehand. First, create a plan for team growth and announce it to everybody. The plan should include risks and their mitigation actions. The plan should say who will be fired first when or if the project goes down. The plan should give a predictable and measurable picture of the reality around your office. It should be a map of terrain you’re going to cross with your team. When it’s time to make a decision, everybody will understand why it’s made and will respect you as a manager who predicted the situation and managed it professionally.</p><aside class="quote">Everybody should know everybody's salaries, bonuses, and benefits</aside><p><strong>Put Money on the Table</strong>. Discuss money openly and freely, right in the office, right in front of everybody. This advice is for true professionals. If you can’t do what is said above, don’t even try this one. But if you consider yourself a real pro in management and leadership, you should put money on the table and let everybody know who is getting what, when, why, and why not. Everybody should know everybody’s salaries, bonuses, benefits, and the rationale behind them. Each programmer should know what he or she should do in order to get a $5,000 raise to their annual salary. Also, he or she should know why a colleague is called “senior developer” while his or her title is still “junior.” This information should be public and printed on the wall right behind your chair. Why don’t most managers do this? Because they don’t have any <a href="/2014/09/24/why-monetary-awards-dont-work.html">rationale</a> behind their monetary decisions. Instead of managing the money, they let money manage them.</p></div></article></div><div class="wrapper"><div class="unprintable"> <hr/><p>If you like this article, you will definitely like these <strong>very relevant</strong> posts too:</p><p><a href='/2016/09/27/command-control-innovate.html'><strong>Command, Control, and Innovate</strong></a> <br/>Command and control works in military organizations, but it apparently doesn&#39;t work in Silicon Valley; why is that?</p><p><a href='/2016/06/21/how-to-hire-programmer.html'><strong>How to Hire a Programmer</strong></a> <br/>Finding and hiring a good programmer is a tricky task, and most entrepreneurs don&#39;t know how to do it right.</p><p><a href='/2015/10/13/competition-without-rules.html'><strong>Competition Without Rules Is Destructive</strong></a> <br/>When your team doesn&#39;t have rules of competition, you get competition without rules, which ruins team motivation.</p></div></div><div class="disqus" role="complementary"><p class="disqus_hint"> Please, use <a href="https://help.disqus.com/commenting/what-html-tags-are-allowed-within-comments">syntax highlighting</a> in your comments, to make them more readable.</p><div id="disqus_thread" class="disqus-thread"> <a>&nbsp;</a></div><script> var disqus_config = function () { this.page.url = document.location.href.split('?')[0].split('#')[0].replace('https://', 'http://'); this.page.identifier = this.page.url; }; (function() { var d = document, s = d.createElement('script'); s.src = '//yegor256.disqus.com/embed.js'; s.setAttribute('data-timestamp', +new Date()); (d.head || d.body).appendChild(s); })(); </script> <noscript><div><p class="red"> JavaScript is disabled in your browser, that's why you can't see comments under this post.</p></div></noscript></div><div class="wrapper"> <footer class="footer"><p> &copy; <span itemscope="" itemprop="copyrightHolder" itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"> <span itemprop="name">Yegor Bugayenko</span> </span> 2014&ndash;<span itemprop="copyrightYear">2018</span></p></footer></div></section><div class="wrapper unprintable" style="text-align:center;margin-top:2em;"> <a href="http://www.sixnines.io/h/3ba1652f"> <img src="//www.sixnines.io/b/3ba1652f?style=flat" alt="sixnines availability badge"/> </a></div><script src="//code.jquery.com/jquery-1.9.0.min.js"></script> <script src="/js/all.js?8c0c9d2d5e8"></script> <script>var disqus_shortname = 'yegor256';</script> <script id="dsq-count-scr" src="//yegor256.disqus.com/count.js" async="async"></script> <script> (function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){ (i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o), m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m) })(window,document,'script','//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga'); ga('create', 'UA-1963507-32', 'auto'); ga('send', 'pageview'); </script> <script> Cd=document;Cr="&"+Math.random();Cp="&s=1"; Cd.cookie="b=b";if(Cd.cookie)Cp+="&c=1"; Cp+="&t="+(new Date()).getTimezoneOffset(); if(self!=top)Cp+="&f=1"; </script> <script> if(navigator.javaEnabled())Cp+="&j=1"; </script> <script> if(typeof(screen)!='undefined')Cp+="&w="+screen.width+"&h="+ screen.height+"&d="+(screen.colorDepth?screen.colorDepth:screen.pixelDepth); </script> <script> Cd.write("<img src='//c.hit.ua/hit?i=95870&g=0&x=2"+Cp+Cr+ "&r="+escape(Cd.referrer)+"&u="+escape(window.location.href)+ "' border='0' wi"+"dth='1' he"+"ight='1'/>"); </script> <script type="application/ld+json"> { "@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Person", "name": "Yegor Bugayenko", "url": "https://www.yegor256.com", "sameAs": [ "https://www.facebook.com/yegor256", "https://instagram.com/yegor256", "https://www.linkedin.com/in/yegor256", "https://twitter.com/yegor256", "https://github.com/yegor256", "https://www.pinterest.com/yegor256/" ] } </script> </body> </html> <!DOCTYPE html> <html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/WebSite"> <head> <meta charset="utf-8"/> <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;At &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zerocracy.com&quot;&gt;Zerocracy&lt;/a&gt;, we work in distributed teams and keep all our communications &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/10/07/stop-chatting-start-coding.html&quot;&gt;in tickets&lt;/a&gt;.

Jane (1997) by Ridley Scott&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;No matter how unpleasant this could be, let’s face the reality: each software project is a business, and we, the developers, are its &lt;em&gt;resources&lt;/em&gt;. Just like concrete, wood, and glass are the resources required to build a house, which is also a business activity. No matter how much we think about ourselves as a family having fun together and writing code because we enjoy it, each business looks at it completely differently.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The project needs us to &lt;em&gt;produce&lt;/em&gt; classes, lines of code, methods, functions, files, and features. Then, the project can convert them into happy customers, which will give us something back—usually cash. Finally, the project will share that cash among us, &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/12/16/investors-are-too-scared.html&quot;&gt;investors&lt;/a&gt;, and the government.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;youtube&quot;&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBQoTZ-1X-o&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;box&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YBQoTZ-1X-o/mqdefault.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;YouTube video #YBQoTZ-1X-o&quot; /&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;play&quot;&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;icon icon-play&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;div&gt;How to Cut Corners and Stay Cool (webinar #15); 1 June 2016.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;A properly planned and managed project acquires the best resources its budget can afford and then relies on their quality. A programmer who doesn’t have adequate skills or knowledge is an &lt;em&gt;unreliable resource&lt;/em&gt;. Obviously, no project would acquire such a resource from the start. However, this weakness may be revealed in the middle of the project.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Say you’re building a house and you contracted a plumber to install a drainage system. When it’s time to mount the equipment, he tells you that he’s never worked with it and doesn’t know how to install it. It was a risk, and it occurred. A good &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/09/22/micromanagement.html&quot;&gt;project manager&lt;/a&gt; always has a fallback plan or even a few of them. Obviously, the best option would be to contract &lt;em&gt;another&lt;/em&gt; plumber. The worst option would be to train the original one on the spot.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;The goal of the project is to build a house, not to train a plumber&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;Wait, why is that so obvious? The plumber is a great guy. Yes, he doesn’t know how to work with this equipment, but that doesn’t mean we should &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/09/16/how-to-fire-someone-right.html&quot;&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt; him immediately. Let’s pay for his training, send him to some courses, buy him some books, let him experiment with the equipment for some time, and then he will be able to install it in our house. Great plan, isn’t it? The plumber will be happy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But the project won’t.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The goal of the project is to build a house, not to train a plumber. The project doesn’t even have funds to train the bloody plumber! If we train and teach all our workers, we won’t ever build a house. We’re not running a school here. We’re building a house!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While working on a software project, a good project manager has a staffing management plan that describes how skills will be recruited, tested, applied, and discharged when necessary. Such a plan may include training, but it would be as small an amount as possible—mostly because a plumber trained by us &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/06/02/how-to-estimate-software-cost.html&quot;&gt;costs&lt;/a&gt; much more than one trained by someone else but does exactly the same, or worse, work. Thus, a smart project manager acquires project members who are already capable of performing their duties and falls back on training only in exceptional situations.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;If you make your projects spend their money on your education, that's theft&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now, a logical question: What should we, as programmers, do? We want to learn, and we don’t want to spend our own money on it. We don’t want to sit home for a few years learning all possible technologies before entering the job market as experts, ready to be hired. We want to learn on the job. We basically want to use project budgets for our own personal educational needs. Moreover, a smart programmer exits every project with some new knowledge, new skills, and new technologies in his or her portfolio.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, if you make your projects spend their money on your education, that’s theft. And a good project manager should stop you, saying “This is not a school!”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What is the solution?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I believe that in the software business, there is only one workaround—blame the project for your own deficiencies in education, skills, or information. I’m being absolutely serious. Let’s discuss a few practical situations.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Say you have a module to work with, and it has to be written in Python. You have no experience in Python; you’re a Java developer. Who is at fault here? You could think of it as your problem and ask your project manager to teach you, but he should tell you he’s not running a school and get rid of you. That’s a bad scenario for both of you. Instead, blame the project manager. He &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/06/21/how-to-hire-programmer.html&quot;&gt;hired&lt;/a&gt; you. He put you into this situation. He planned all project activities, so he probably knows what he is doing. This means that the project &lt;em&gt;documentation&lt;/em&gt; should be detailed enough for a Java developer to create that Python module. However, it is not detailed enough. So report this &lt;em&gt;issue&lt;/em&gt; and wait for its &lt;em&gt;resolution&lt;/em&gt;. Explain in your &lt;a href=&quot;/2018/04/24/right-way-to-report-bugs.html&quot;&gt;bug report&lt;/a&gt; that you honestly started to work with the module and realized that its documentation is not complete enough for a Java developer to understand. Ask the project manager to fix this. If the project decides to invest its money into the documentation, you have the chance to read it and learn. Thus, the project’s money spent on your education will also contribute to the project. It’s a win-win.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Here is another example: Say you have to fix a Java module and you’re a Java developer. You understand Java, but you don’t understand how this algorithm works. You could blame yourself for not reading &lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/2c5o1n2&quot;&gt;Knuth&lt;/a&gt; in school and ask the project to train you on it. A good and strong project manager should tell you that it’s not a school and get rid of you. Again, a bad scenario for both of you. Instead, blame the project. The code is &lt;em&gt;not self-descriptive&lt;/em&gt; and is difficult to understand. The algorithm implementation is &lt;em&gt;not obvious&lt;/em&gt; and is poorly documented. Ask for better documentation. If the project invests its money into the documentation, you will learn the algorithm from it. The source code will be improved, and you will have improved your skills. Win-win.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One more example: Say you are tasked to implement a WebSockets back-end in an existing web app. You know how WebSockets work but can’t understand how to connect this new back-end to the existing persistence layer. You are rather new to the project and don’t understand what would be the right design. You could ask for the project to provide training to explain how the code works and how it can be extended with features like this one. A project manager should tell you that you’re not in school and are supposed to understand the software if the project is paying you a software developer &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/12/06/how-to-pay-programmers-less.html&quot;&gt;salary&lt;/a&gt;. And he will be right. But it’s a bad scenario for both of you. Instead, blame the project for &lt;em&gt;incomplete&lt;/em&gt; design documentation. Good software should properly document its architecture and design. Ask for the project to provide such documentation. If it invests its time and money into better documentation, you will learn from it and find all the necessary answers. Another win-win.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are a few other examples in my &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/01/15/how-to-cut-corners.html&quot;&gt;How to Cut Corners and Stay Cool&lt;/a&gt; post.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In conclusion, I would recommend you remember that software projects are, first and foremost, business activities where we, the developers, are &lt;em&gt;resources&lt;/em&gt;. In order to obtain something for ourselves in terms of education and training, we should align our goals with project objectives.

A programmer who doesn’t have adequate skills or knowledge is an &lt;em&gt;unreliable resource&lt;/em&gt;. Obviously, no project would acquire such a resource from the start. However, this weakness may be revealed in the middle of the project.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Say you’re building a house and you contracted a plumber to install a drainage system. When it’s time to mount the equipment, he tells you that he’s never worked with it and doesn’t know how to install it. It was a risk, and it occurred. A good &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/09/22/micromanagement.html&quot;&gt;project manager&lt;/a&gt; always has a fallback plan or even a few of them. Obviously, the best option would be to contract &lt;em&gt;another&lt;/em&gt; plumber. The worst option would be to train the original one on the spot.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;The goal of the project is to build a house, not to train a plumber&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;Wait, why is that so obvious? The plumber is a great guy. Yes, he doesn’t know how to work with this equipment, but that doesn’t mean we should &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/09/16/how-to-fire-someone-right.html&quot;&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt; him immediately. Let’s pay for his training, send him to some courses, buy him some books, let him experiment with the equipment for some time, and then he will be able to install it in our house. Great plan, isn’t it? The plumber will be happy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But the project won’t.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The goal of the project is to build a house, not to train a plumber. The project doesn’t even have funds to train the bloody plumber! If we train and teach all our workers, we won’t ever build a house. We’re not running a school here. We’re building a house!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While working on a software project, a good project manager has a staffing management plan that describes how skills will be recruited, tested, applied, and discharged when necessary. Such a plan may include training, but it would be as small an amount as possible—mostly because a plumber trained by us &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/06/02/how-to-estimate-software-cost.html&quot;&gt;costs&lt;/a&gt; much more than one trained by someone else but does exactly the same, or worse, work. Thus, a smart project manager acquires project members who are already capable of performing their duties and falls back on training only in exceptional situations.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;If you make your projects spend their money on your education, that's theft&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now, a logical question: What should we, as programmers, do? We want to learn, and we don’t want to spend our own money on it. We don’t want to sit home for a few years learning all possible technologies before entering the job market as experts, ready to be hired. We want to learn on the job. We basically want to use project budgets for our own personal educational needs. Moreover, a smart programmer exits every project with some new knowledge, new skills, and new technologies in his or her portfolio.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, if you make your projects spend their money on your education, that’s theft. And a good project manager should stop you, saying “This is not a school!”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What is the solution?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I believe that in the software business, there is only one workaround—blame the project for your own deficiencies in education, skills, or information. I’m being absolutely serious. Let’s discuss a few practical situations.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Say you have a module to work with, and it has to be written in Python. You have no experience in Python; you’re a Java developer. Who is at fault here? You could think of it as your problem and ask your project manager to teach you, but he should tell you he’s not running a school and get rid of you. That’s a bad scenario for both of you. Instead, blame the project manager. He &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/06/21/how-to-hire-programmer.html&quot;&gt;hired&lt;/a&gt; you. He put you into this situation. He planned all project activities, so he probably knows what he is doing. This means that the project &lt;em&gt;documentation&lt;/em&gt; should be detailed enough for a Java developer to create that Python module. However, it is not detailed enough. So report this &lt;em&gt;issue&lt;/em&gt; and wait for its &lt;em&gt;resolution&lt;/em&gt;. Explain in your &lt;a href=&quot;/2018/04/24/right-way-to-report-bugs.html&quot;&gt;bug report&lt;/a&gt; that you honestly started to work with the module and realized that its documentation is not complete enough for a Java developer to understand. Ask the project manager to fix this. If the project decides to invest its money into the documentation, you have the chance to read it and learn. Thus, the project’s money spent on your education will also contribute to the project. It’s a win-win.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Here is another example: Say you have to fix a Java module and you’re a Java developer. You understand Java, but you don’t understand how this algorithm works. You could blame yourself for not reading &lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/2c5o1n2&quot;&gt;Knuth&lt;/a&gt; in school and ask the project to train you on it. A good and strong project manager should tell you that it’s not a school and get rid of you. Again, a bad scenario for both of you. Instead, blame the project. The code is &lt;em&gt;not self-descriptive&lt;/em&gt; and is difficult to understand. The algorithm implementation is &lt;em&gt;not obvious&lt;/em&gt; and is poorly documented. Ask for better documentation. If the project invests its money into the documentation, you will learn the algorithm from it. The source code will be improved, and you will have improved your skills. Win-win.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One more example: Say you are tasked to implement a WebSockets back-end in an existing web app. You know how WebSockets work but can’t understand how to connect this new back-end to the existing persistence layer. You are rather new to the project and don’t understand what would be the right design. You could ask for the project to provide training to explain how the code works and how it can be extended with features like this one. A project manager should tell you that you’re not in school and are supposed to understand the software if the project is paying you a software developer &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/12/06/how-to-pay-programmers-less.html&quot;&gt;salary&lt;/a&gt;. And he will be right. But it’s a bad scenario for both of you. Instead, blame the project for &lt;em&gt;incomplete&lt;/em&gt; design documentation. Good software should properly document its architecture and design. Ask for the project to provide such documentation. If it invests its time and money into better documentation, you will learn from it and find all the necessary answers. Another win-win.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are a few other examples in my &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/01/15/how-to-cut-corners.html&quot;&gt;How to Cut Corners and Stay Cool&lt;/a&gt; post.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In conclusion, I would recommend you remember that software projects are, first and foremost, business activities where we, the developers, are &lt;em&gt;resources&lt;/em&gt;. In order to obtain something for ourselves in terms of education and training, we should align our goals with project objectives. Instead of asking for help and information, we should blame the project for its lack of documentation. By fixing this flaw, the project will improve its artifacts and, at the same time, provide valuable knowledge to us, its participants.&lt;/p&gt; "/> <meta name="twitter:url" property="og:url" content="https://www.yegor256.com/2015/02/16/it-is-not-a-school.html"/> <meta name="telegram:channel" content="AAAAAEJFMRzsRTRxM3ec6A"/> <link rel="search" type="application/opensearchdescription+xml" href="/opensearch.xml" title="yegor256" /> <link rel="shortcut icon" href="/favicon.ico?8c0c9d2d5e8"/> <link rel="apple-touch-icon" href="/favicon.ico?8c0c9d2d5e8"/> <link rel="alternate" type="application/rss+xml" title="RSS for yegor256.com" href="https://www.yegor256.com/rss.xml"/> <link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/layout.css?8c0c9d2d5e8"/> <link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/icons.css?8c0c9d2d5e8"/> <link rel="canonical" href="https://www.yegor256.com/2015/02/16/it-is-not-a-school.html" /> <link rel="amphtml" href="https://www.yegor256.com/2015/02/16/it-is-not-a-school.amp.html" /> <title>It's Not a School! </title> <meta name='og:image' content='https://www.yegor256.com/images/2015/02/gi-jane.png'/><meta name='twitter:image' content='https://www.yegor256.com/images/2015/02/gi-jane.png'/><meta name='og:image:width' content='1100'/> <meta name='twitter:image:width' content='1100'/><meta name='og:image:height' content='619'/> <meta name='twitter:image:height' content='619'/><meta name='twitter:card' content='summary_large_image'/><meta name='twitter:image:alt' content='G.I.

Instead, blame the project manager. He <a href="/2016/06/21/how-to-hire-programmer.html">hired</a> you. He put you into this situation. He planned all project activities, so he probably knows what he is doing. This means that the project <em>documentation</em> should be detailed enough for a Java developer to create that Python module. However, it is not detailed enough. So report this <em>issue</em> and wait for its <em>resolution</em>. Explain in your <a href="/2018/04/24/right-way-to-report-bugs.html">bug report</a> that you honestly started to work with the module and realized that its documentation is not complete enough for a Java developer to understand. Ask the project manager to fix this. If the project decides to invest its money into the documentation, you have the chance to read it and learn. Thus, the project’s money spent on your education will also contribute to the project. It’s a win-win.</p><p>Here is another example: Say you have to fix a Java module and you’re a Java developer. You understand Java, but you don’t understand how this algorithm works. You could blame yourself for not reading <a href="http://amzn.to/2c5o1n2">Knuth</a> in school and ask the project to train you on it. A good and strong project manager should tell you that it’s not a school and get rid of you. Again, a bad scenario for both of you. Instead, blame the project. The code is <em>not self-descriptive</em> and is difficult to understand. The algorithm implementation is <em>not obvious</em> and is poorly documented. Ask for better documentation. If the project invests its money into the documentation, you will learn the algorithm from it. The source code will be improved, and you will have improved your skills. Win-win.</p><p>One more example: Say you are tasked to implement a WebSockets back-end in an existing web app. You know how WebSockets work but can’t understand how to connect this new back-end to the existing persistence layer. You are rather new to the project and don’t understand what would be the right design. You could ask for the project to provide training to explain how the code works and how it can be extended with features like this one. A project manager should tell you that you’re not in school and are supposed to understand the software if the project is paying you a software developer <a href="/2016/12/06/how-to-pay-programmers-less.html">salary</a>. And he will be right. But it’s a bad scenario for both of you. Instead, blame the project for <em>incomplete</em> design documentation. Good software should properly document its architecture and design. Ask for the project to provide such documentation. If it invests its time and money into better documentation, you will learn from it and find all the necessary answers. Another win-win.</p><p>There are a few other examples in my <a href="/2015/01/15/how-to-cut-corners.html">How to Cut Corners and Stay Cool</a> post.</p><p>In conclusion, I would recommend you remember that software projects are, first and foremost, business activities where we, the developers, are <em>resources</em>. In order to obtain something for ourselves in terms of education and training, we should align our goals with project objectives. Instead of asking for help and information, we should blame the project for its lack of documentation. By fixing this flaw, the project will improve its artifacts and, at the same time, provide valuable knowledge to us, its participants.</p></p><nav class="buttons notranslate desktop-only"> <a href="http://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://www.yegor256.com/2015/02/16/it-is-not-a-school.html" title="Share on Facebook" class="button" rel="nofollow"> <span class="count count-facebook">0</span> <i class="icon icon-facebook notranslate" aria-hidden="true"></i> </a> <a href="https://twitter.com/share?url=https://www.yegor256.com/2015/02/16/it-is-not-a-school.html&amp;text=It%27s+Not+a+School%21" title="Share on Twitter" class="button" rel="nofollow"> <span class="count count-twitter">0</span> <i class="icon icon-twitter notranslate" aria-hidden="true"></i> </a> <a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=https://www.yegor256.com/2015/02/16/it-is-not-a-school.html" title="Share on Google+" class="button" rel="nofollow"> <span class="count count-googleplus">0</span> <i class="icon icon-googleplus notranslate" aria-hidden="true"></i> </a> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/cws/share?url=https://www.yegor256.com/2015/02/16/it-is-not-a-school.html" title="Share on LinkedIn" class="button" rel="nofollow"> <span class="count count-linkedin">0</span> <i class="icon icon-linkedin notranslate" aria-hidden="true"></i> </a> <a href="http://reddit.com/submit?url=https://www.yegor256.com/2015/02/16/it-is-not-a-school.html%3F2015-07&amp;title=It%27s+Not+a+School%21" title="Share on Reddit" class="button" rel="nofollow"> <span class="count count-reddit">0</span> <i class="icon icon-reddit notranslate" aria-hidden="true"></i> </a> <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/submitlink?u=https://www.yegor256.com/2015/02/16/it-is-not-a-school.html%3F2015-07&amp;t=It%27s+Not+a+School%21" title="Share on Hacker News" class="button" rel="nofollow"> <span class="count count-hackernews">0</span> <i class="icon icon-hackernews notranslate" aria-hidden="true"></i> </a> </nav> </header> <article class="main" itemprop="articleBody"><div ><p>At <a href="https://www.zerocracy.com">Zerocracy</a>, we work in distributed teams and keep all our communications <a href="/2014/10/07/stop-chatting-start-coding.html">in tickets</a>.

A programmer who doesn’t have adequate skills or knowledge is an <em>unreliable resource</em>. Obviously, no project would acquire such a resource from the start. However, this weakness may be revealed in the middle of the project.</p><p>Say you’re building a house and you contracted a plumber to install a drainage system. When it’s time to mount the equipment, he tells you that he’s never worked with it and doesn’t know how to install it. It was a risk, and it occurred. A good <a href="/2015/09/22/micromanagement.html">project manager</a> always has a fallback plan or even a few of them. Obviously, the best option would be to contract <em>another</em> plumber. The worst option would be to train the original one on the spot.</p><aside class="quote">The goal of the project is to build a house, not to train a plumber</aside><p>Wait, why is that so obvious? The plumber is a great guy. Yes, he doesn’t know how to work with this equipment, but that doesn’t mean we should <a href="/2015/09/16/how-to-fire-someone-right.html">fire</a> him immediately. Let’s pay for his training, send him to some courses, buy him some books, let him experiment with the equipment for some time, and then he will be able to install it in our house. Great plan, isn’t it? The plumber will be happy.</p><p>But the project won’t.</p><p>The goal of the project is to build a house, not to train a plumber. The project doesn’t even have funds to train the bloody plumber! If we train and teach all our workers, we won’t ever build a house. We’re not running a school here. We’re building a house!</p><p>While working on a software project, a good project manager has a staffing management plan that describes how skills will be recruited, tested, applied, and discharged when necessary. Such a plan may include training, but it would be as small an amount as possible—mostly because a plumber trained by us <a href="/2015/06/02/how-to-estimate-software-cost.html">costs</a> much more than one trained by someone else but does exactly the same, or worse, work. Thus, a smart project manager acquires project members who are already capable of performing their duties and falls back on training only in exceptional situations.</p><aside class="quote">If you make your projects spend their money on your education, that's theft</aside><p>Now, a logical question: What should we, as programmers, do? We want to learn, and we don’t want to spend our own money on it. We don’t want to sit home for a few years learning all possible technologies before entering the job market as experts, ready to be hired. We want to learn on the job. We basically want to use project budgets for our own personal educational needs. Moreover, a smart programmer exits every project with some new knowledge, new skills, and new technologies in his or her portfolio.</p><p>However, if you make your projects spend their money on your education, that’s theft. And a good project manager should stop you, saying “This is not a school!”</p><p>What is the solution?</p><p>I believe that in the software business, there is only one workaround—blame the project for your own deficiencies in education, skills, or information.

Wait, the deal was to deliver two versions and get cash in two installments. Let’s back up a little and think—how can we break this small tool into two parts?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On first thought, let’s release the tool itself first and build automation and testing next. Is that a good idea? Can we deliver any software without running it first with a test? How can I be sure that it works if I don’t ship tests together with it? What will my friend think about me releasing anything without tests? This would be a total embarrassment.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Okay, let’s release &lt;code&gt;Makefile&lt;/code&gt; first and &lt;code&gt;wc.c&lt;/code&gt; next. But what will my friend do with a couple of tests and no product in hand? This first release will be absolutely pointless, and I won’t get my $100.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Every new increment must add some value to the product as it is perceived by the customer, not by us programmers&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now we’re getting to the point of this article. What I’m trying to say is that every new increment must add some value to the product as it is perceived by the customer, not by us programmers. The &lt;code&gt;Makefile&lt;/code&gt; is definitely a valuable artifact, but it provides no value to my friend. He doesn’t need it, but I need it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Here is what I’m going to do. I’ll release a skeleton of the tool, backed by the tests but with an absolutely dummy implementation.

I will disable the first test to make sure the build passes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Does my tool work? Yes, it does. Does it count words? Yes, it does for some inputs. Does it have value to my friend. Obviously! He can run it from the command line, and he can pass a file as an input. He will always get number “5” as a result of counting, though. That’s a bummer, but it’s an alpha version. He doesn’t expect it to work perfectly.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, it works, it is backed by tests, and it is properly packaged.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What I just did is a top-down approach to design. First of all, I created something that provides value to my customer. I made sure it also satisfies my technical objectives, like proper unit test coverage and build automation. But the most important goal for me was to make sure my friend received something … and paid me.&lt;/p&gt; " /> <meta name="keywords" content="next, path, output, content, previous, url, relative_path, id, collection, excerpt, draft, categories, layout, title, date, tags, description, keywords, image, jb_picture, slug, ext" /> <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1"/> <meta name="google-site-verification" content="JEj_gQr2CPe2QKGw8XdMz0R7VboQIUbX3FlM-lwTq-8" /> <meta name="author" content="Yegor Bugayenko"> <meta name="article:published_time" content="2015-02-12 00:00:00 +0000"> <meta name="og:site_name" content="Yegor Bugayenko"/> <meta name="og:type" content="article" /> <meta name="og:locale" content="en_US" /> <meta name="twitter:account_id" content="4503599630178231" /> <meta name="twitter:creator" content="@yegor256"/> <meta name="twitter:site" content="@yegor256"/> <meta name="twitter:title" property="og:title" content="Code For the User, Not for Yourself"/> <meta name="twitter:description" property="og:description" content="&lt;p&gt;First, no matter what the methodology is, we all write software for our users (a.k.a. customers, project sponsors, end users, or &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/01/26/happy-boss-false-objective.html&quot;&gt;clients&lt;/a&gt;). Second, no matter what the methodology is, we write incrementally, releasing features and bug fixes one by one. Maybe I’m saying something absolutely obvious here, but it’s important to remember that each new version should first of all satisfy the needs of the user, not of us programmers. In other words, the way we decompose a big task into smaller pieces should be user-targeted, and that’s why you always work &lt;strong&gt;top down&lt;/strong&gt;.

He promised to pay me $200 for this work, and I promised him I’d deliver the product in two increments—an alpha and beta version. I promised him I’d release the alpha version on Saturday and the beta version on Sunday. He is going to pay me $100 after the first release and the rest after the second release.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I’ll write in C, and he will pay in cash.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The tool is very primitive, and it only took me a few minutes to write.

Look at it:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-c&quot; data-lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;cp&quot;&gt;#include&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;cpf&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;stdio.h&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;cp&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;main&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;printf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;And I will modify the &lt;code&gt;Makefile&lt;/code&gt; accordingly. I will disable the first test to make sure the build passes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Does my tool work? Yes, it does. Does it count words? Yes, it does for some inputs. Does it have value to my friend. Obviously! He can run it from the command line, and he can pass a file as an input. He will always get number “5” as a result of counting, though. That’s a bummer, but it’s an alpha version. He doesn’t expect it to work perfectly.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, it works, it is backed by tests, and it is properly packaged.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What I just did is a top-down approach to design. First of all, I created something that provides value to my customer. I made sure it also satisfies my technical objectives, like proper unit test coverage and build automation. But the most important goal for me was to make sure my friend received something … and paid me.&lt;/p&gt; "/> <meta name="twitter:url" property="og:url"

Is that a good idea? Can we deliver any software without running it first with a test? How can I be sure that it works if I don’t ship tests together with it? What will my friend think about me releasing anything without tests? This would be a total embarrassment.</p><p>Okay, let’s release <code>Makefile</code> first and <code>wc.c</code> next.

What I’m trying to say is that every new increment must add some value to the product as it is perceived by the customer, not by us programmers. The <code>Makefile</code> is definitely a valuable artifact, but it provides no value to my friend. He doesn’t need it, but I need it.</p><p>Here is what I’m going to do. I’ll release a skeleton of the tool, backed by the tests but with an absolutely dummy implementation. Look at it:</p><figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-c" data-lang="c"><span></span><span class="cp">#include</span> <span class="cpf">&lt;stdio.h&gt;</span><span class="cp"></span>

  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure><p>And I will modify the <code>Makefile</code> accordingly. I will disable the first test to make sure the build passes.</p><p>Does my tool work? Yes, it does. Does it count words? Yes, it does for some inputs. Does it have value to my friend. Obviously! He can run it from the command line, and he can pass a file as an input. He will always get number “5” as a result of counting, though. That’s a bummer, but it’s an alpha version. He doesn’t expect it to work perfectly.</p><p>However, it works, it is backed by tests, and it is properly packaged.</p><p>What I just did is a top-down approach to design. First of all, I created something that provides value to my customer. I made sure it also satisfies my technical objectives, like proper unit test coverage and build automation. But the most important goal for me was to make sure my friend received something … and paid me.</p></div></article></div><div class="wrapper"> <related-posts /></div><div class="disqus" role="complementary"><p class="disqus_hint"> Please, use <a href="https://help.disqus.com/commenting/what-html-tags-are-allowed-within-comments">syntax highlighting</a> in your comments, to make them more readable.</p><div id="disqus_thread" class="disqus-thread"> <a>&nbsp;</a></div><script> var disqus_config = function () { this.page.url = document.location.href.split('?')[0].split('#')[0].replace('https://', 'http://'); this.page.identifier = this.page.url; }; (function() { var d = document, s = d.createElement('script'); s.src = '//yegor256.disqus.com/embed.js'; s.setAttribute('data-timestamp', +new Date()); (d.head || d.body).appendChild(s); })(); </script> <noscript><div><p class="red"> JavaScript is disabled in your browser, that's why you can't see comments under this post.</p></div></noscript></div><div class="wrapper"> <footer class="footer"><p> &copy; <span itemscope="" itemprop="copyrightHolder" itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"> <span itemprop="name">Yegor Bugayenko</span> </span> 2014&ndash;<span itemprop="copyrightYear">2018</span></p></footer></div></section><div class="wrapper unprintable" style="text-align:center;margin-top:2em;"> <a href="http://www.sixnines.io/h/3ba1652f"> <img src="//www.sixnines.io/b/3ba1652f?style=flat" alt="sixnines availability badge"/> </a></div><script src="//code.jquery.com/jquery-1.9.0.min.js"></script> <script src="/js/all.js?8c0c9d2d5e8"></script> <script>var disqus_shortname = 'yegor256';</script> <script id="dsq-count-scr" src="//yegor256.disqus.com/count.js" async="async"></script> <script> (function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){ (i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o), m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m) })(window,document,'script','//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga'); ga('create', 'UA-1963507-32', 'auto'); ga('send', 'pageview'); </script> <script> Cd=document;Cr="&"+Math.random();Cp="&s=1"; Cd.cookie="b=b";if(Cd.cookie)Cp+="&c=1"; Cp+="&t="+(new Date()).getTimezoneOffset(); if(self!=top)Cp+="&f=1"; </script> <script> if(navigator.javaEnabled())Cp+="&j=1"; </script> <script> if(typeof(screen)!='undefined')Cp+="&w="+screen.width+"&h="+ screen.height+"&d="+(screen.colorDepth?screen.colorDepth:screen.pixelDepth); </script> <script> Cd.write("<img src='//c.hit.ua/hit?i=95870&g=0&x=2"+Cp+Cr+ "&r="+escape(Cd.referrer)+"&u="+escape(window.location.href)+ "' border='0' wi"+"dth='1' he"+"ight='1'/>"); </script> <script type="application/ld+json"> { "@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Person", "name": "Yegor Bugayenko", "url": "https://www.yegor256.com", "sameAs": [ "https://www.facebook.com/yegor256", "https://instagram.com/yegor256", "https://www.linkedin.com/in/yegor256", "https://twitter.com/yegor256", "https://github.com/yegor256", "https://www.pinterest.com/yegor256/" ] } </script> </body> </html> <!DOCTYPE html> <html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/WebSite"> <head> <meta charset="utf-8"/> <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_review&quot;&gt;Code reviews&lt;/a&gt; (a.k.a. peer reviews) must be a mandatory practice for every serious software development team. I hope there is no debate about this. Some do pre-merge code reviews, &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/07/21/read-only-master-branch.html&quot;&gt;protecting&lt;/a&gt; their master/development branch from accidental mistakes. Others do post-merge &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/12/18/independent-technical-reviews.html&quot;&gt;regular reviews&lt;/a&gt; to discover bugs and inconsistencies after they are introduced by their authors. Some even do both, reviewing before merges and regularly after. Code reviews are very similar to a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White-box_testing&quot;&gt;white-box testing&lt;/a&gt; technique where a tester looks for defects with full access to the sources of the software. In either case, a code review is a great instrument to increase quality and boost team motivation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, it’s not so simple to do them right. I would even say it’s very easy and comfortable to do them wrong. Most code reviews and reviewers I’ve seen make similar mistakes. That’s why I decided to summarize the four basic principles of a good reviewer as I see them. Hopefully you find them helpful.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;!--more--&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;jb_picture&quot;&gt;&lt;img itemprop=&quot;image&quot; alt=&quot;Main picture&quot; src=&quot;/images/2015/02/kim-jong-un-doing-code-review.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;no-fear&quot;&gt;No Fear&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are a few different fears a serious code reviewer should renounce. The first and most popular is the fear of offending an author of the code. “&lt;em&gt;I’d better close my eyes and pretend I didn’t see her bugs today so tomorrow she will ignore my mistakes&lt;/em&gt;”—This is the kind of attitude this fear produces. Needless to say, it’s counterproductive and degrades &lt;a href=&quot;/2017/04/11/flexibility-equates-lower-quality.html&quot;&gt;code quality&lt;/a&gt; and team morale. Here is my advice: be direct, honest, and straight-forward. If you don’t like the code, you don’t like it. You shouldn’t care how your opinion will be taken by the author of the code.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you do have such feelings toward your colleagues, there is something wrong with the management model. You’re afraid of being rejected by the team for “not being a team player,” which is a label attached to you by the weakest members of the team, not by the project sponsor. The sponsor pays you to produce high-quality software. The sponsor doesn’t care how much your intention to increase quality offends others, who care less. The sponsor wants his money to produce deliverables that can be sold to customers and returned back in profit. The sponsor is not paying you to make friends in the &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/10/06/how-to-be-good-office-slave.html&quot;&gt;office&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The next type of fear sounds like this: “&lt;em&gt;If I reject this code, I will delay the release&lt;/em&gt;” Again, it goes without saying that such an attitude does a significant disservice to the entire project. You will accept the code and close your eyes to what you don’t like in it. The code will go into the next release, and we’ll ship it sooner. You won’t be a bottleneck, and nobody will say that because of that dogmatic code reviewer, we delayed the release and lost some cash. You will be a good team player, right? Wrong!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As I’ve &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/01/15/how-to-cut-corners.html&quot;&gt;mentioned before&lt;/a&gt;, a professional team player understands his or her personal role in a project and doesn’t cover anyone’s ass. If the rejection of &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/11/24/imprisonment-for-irresponsible-coding.html&quot;&gt;bad code&lt;/a&gt; delays the release, that’s the fault of its author. Your professional responsibility is to make this fault visible. That’s how you help the team learn and improve.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I think it’s obvious that the education and improvement of a team first requires getting rid of bad programmers and promoting good ones. Honest and fearless code reviewers help the team learn and improve.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Yet another fear is expressed like this: “&lt;em&gt;I may be wrong and they will laugh me out&lt;/em&gt;” Even worse, they may spot my lack of knowledge. They may see that I don’t know what I’m doing. It would be better to stay quiet and pretend there are no bugs in the code. At least then I wouldn’t embarrass myself with stupid comments. You know that it’s much easier to look smart if you keep your mouth shut, right? Wrong!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The project is not paying you to look good. You’re getting your paychecks not because the team loves you but because you produce deliverables on a daily basis. Your professional responsibility is to do what’s best for the project and ignore everyone’s opinions, including the opinion of your boss. Similar to &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/01/26/happy-boss-false-objective.html&quot;&gt;A Happy Boss Is a False Objective&lt;/a&gt;, I would say that the respect of the team is a false goal. Don’t try to earn respect. Instead, create clean code and respect will come automatically.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Let me reiterate: Don’t be afraid to embarrass yourself by making incorrect and stupid comments about someone’s code. Be loyal to the project, not to the expectations of people around you. They expect you to be smart and bright, but the project expects you to say what you think about the code. So screw their opinions; do the right thing and say what you really think.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;no-compromise&quot;&gt;No Compromise&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Okay, you’ve fearlessly said what you thought about the code and simply rejected it. The branch you were reviewing is not good, and you explained why. You asked its author to refactor here and re-write there. What’s next?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He or she will try to make a deal with you. It’s natural and it’s happening in almost every branch I’m seeing in our teams. The author of the code is also a professional developer, and he also has no fear. So he insists that his implementation approach is right and your ideas are wrong. What should a professional code reviewer do in this case?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The worst thing (as in any conflict resolution) is a compromise. This is what ruins quality faster than bad code. A compromise is a conflict resolution technique for which both parties agree not to get what they wanted just for the sake of ceasing the conflict. In other words, “&lt;em&gt;Let’s make peace just to stop fighting&lt;/em&gt;” It’s the worst approach ever.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Instead of a lousy compromise, there are three professional exits from a fight over a piece of code:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;You’re right; I take my comments back!&lt;/em&gt;” This may happen, and it should happen very often. You should be ready to admit your mistakes. You didn’t like the code, but its author explained to you its benefits, and you accepted the logic—not because you want to stop fighting with him but because you really understood the logic and accepted it. Willingness to say, “I’m wrong,” is the first sign of a mature and serious developer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;I will never accept this, period!&lt;/em&gt;” Some code deserves that, and there is nothing wrong with resolving a conflict this way. The opponent may accept the situation and re-write everything. And learn something too.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;Let’s do what the architect says!&lt;/em&gt;” In every project, there is a &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/10/12/who-is-software-architect.html&quot;&gt;software architect&lt;/a&gt; who makes final decisions. Appeal to his opinion and get his final decision. Invite him into the discussion, and ask him to take one side in the conflict. Once he tells you that you’re wrong, accept the decision and try to learn from it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thus, either stand strong on your position and fight for it or admit that you’re wrong. One way or the other. But don’t make a compromise!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Don’t get me wrong; it’s not about being stubborn and holding your cards no matter how bad they are. Be flexible and learn on the spot. Your position may and should change during the negotiation, but don’t accept anything that you don’t like. You can exit the conflict either by being fully convinced that the opponent is right or when the architect says so. Nothing in between.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;no-bullshit&quot;&gt;No Bullshit&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Again, you fearlessly said that a method should be designed differently. Your opponent, the author of the code, replies that he doesn’t think so. You take a look again and decide to stand behind your position. You still think you’re right, and you’re not going to make a compromise. Now what? It’s too early to call an architect, so try to convince your opponent.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In most cases, convincing is teaching. You know something that he doesn’t know. That’s why he created that method the way you don’t like. One of you needs some additional education. Here is an opportunity for you to be a teacher of your colleague. To be an effective teacher, you need to show proof. You need to ground your logic and make sure he understands and accepts it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Be ready to show links, articles, books, reports, examples, etc. Just “&lt;em&gt;I know this because I’ve been writing Java for 15 years&lt;/em&gt;” is not enough. Moreover, this type of argument only makes you less convincing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you don’t have enough convincing proof, think again—maybe you are wrong.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Also, remember that it’s your job to prove that the code you’re reviewing is bad. The author of the code should not prove anything. His code is great by default. The job of the reviewer is to show why and how that’s actually not the case. In other words, you’re the plaintiff and he is the defender. Not the other way around.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;no-offense&quot;&gt;No Offense&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is the last and most difficult principle to follow. No matter how bad the code is and how stubborn your opponent is, you must remain professional. To be honest, I find this very difficult sometimes. At &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zerocracy.com&quot;&gt;Zerocracy&lt;/a&gt;, we’re working in distributed teams and hire a few new people every week. Some of them, despite our &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/10/29/how-much-do-you-cost.html&quot;&gt;screening criteria&lt;/a&gt;, appear to be rather &lt;span class=&quot;strike&quot;&gt;stupid&lt;/span&gt; difficult to deal with.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I encountered a funny situation about a year ago when a new guy was supposed to create a small (20 to 30 lines of code) new feature in an existing Java library. He sent me a pull request (I was a code reviewer) after he put in a few hundred lines of code. That code was absolute garbage and obviously not written by him. I immediately understood that he found it somewhere and copied it. But what could I do? How could I reject it without saying his attitude was unacceptable for a professional developer? I had to spend some time objectively blaming his code for its style, its design, etc. I had to make many serious comments in order to show him that to fix it all, he should delete the garbage and re-write it from scratch. I never saw him again after that task.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;My point is that it’s easy to be professional when you’re dealing with professionals. Unfortunately, that’s not always the case. But no matter how bad the code in front of you is, be patient and convincing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;What do you feel when your pull request is rejected and a lot of &amp;quot;re-work&amp;quot; is required? &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/sociotech?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#sociotech&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;--- Yegor Bugayenko (@yegor256) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/yegor256/status/1013385039701250048?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;July 1, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt; " /> <meta name="keywords" content="next, path, output, content, previous, url, relative_path, id, collection, excerpt, draft, categories, layout, title, date, tags, description, keywords, translated, image, slug, ext" /> <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1"/> <meta name="google-site-verification" content="JEj_gQr2CPe2QKGw8XdMz0R7VboQIUbX3FlM-lwTq-8" /> <meta name="author" content="Yegor Bugayenko"> <meta name="article:published_time" content="2015-02-09 00:00:00 +0000"> <meta name="og:site_name" content="Yegor Bugayenko"/> <meta name="og:type" content="article" /> <meta name="og:locale" content="en_US" /> <meta name="twitter:account_id" content="4503599630178231" /> <meta name="twitter:creator" content="@yegor256"/> <meta name="twitter:site" content="@yegor256"/> <meta name="twitter:title" property="og:title" content="Four NOs of a Serious Code Reviewer"/> <meta name="twitter:description" property="og:description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_review&quot;&gt;Code reviews&lt;/a&gt; (a.k.a. peer reviews) must be a mandatory practice for every serious software development team.

So he insists that his implementation approach is right and your ideas are wrong. What should a professional code reviewer do in this case?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The worst thing (as in any conflict resolution) is a compromise. This is what ruins quality faster than bad code. A compromise is a conflict resolution technique for which both parties agree not to get what they wanted just for the sake of ceasing the conflict. In other words, “&lt;em&gt;Let’s make peace just to stop fighting&lt;/em&gt;” It’s the worst approach ever.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Instead of a lousy compromise, there are three professional exits from a fight over a piece of code:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;You’re right; I take my comments back!&lt;/em&gt;” This may happen, and it should happen very often. You should be ready to admit your mistakes. You didn’t like the code, but its author explained to you its benefits, and you accepted the logic—not because you want to stop fighting with him but because you really understood the logic and accepted it. Willingness to say, “I’m wrong,” is the first sign of a mature and serious developer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;I will never accept this, period!&lt;/em&gt;” Some code deserves that, and there is nothing wrong with resolving a conflict this way. The opponent may accept the situation and re-write everything. And learn something too.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;Let’s do what the architect says!&lt;/em&gt;” In every project, there is a &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/10/12/who-is-software-architect.html&quot;&gt;software architect&lt;/a&gt; who makes final decisions. Appeal to his opinion and get his final decision. Invite him into the discussion, and ask him to take one side in the conflict. Once he tells you that you’re wrong, accept the decision and try to learn from it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thus, either stand strong on your position and fight for it or admit that you’re wrong. One way or the other. But don’t make a compromise!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Don’t get me wrong; it’s not about being stubborn and holding your cards no matter how bad they are. Be flexible and learn on the spot. Your position may and should change during the negotiation, but don’t accept anything that you don’t like. You can exit the conflict either by being fully convinced that the opponent is right or when the architect says so. Nothing in between.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;no-bullshit&quot;&gt;No Bullshit&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Again, you fearlessly said that a method should be designed differently. Your opponent, the author of the code, replies that he doesn’t think so. You take a look again and decide to stand behind your position. You still think you’re right, and you’re not going to make a compromise. Now what? It’s too early to call an architect, so try to convince your opponent.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In most cases, convincing is teaching. You know something that he doesn’t know. That’s why he created that method the way you don’t like. One of you needs some additional education. Here is an opportunity for you to be a teacher of your colleague. To be an effective teacher, you need to show proof. You need to ground your logic and make sure he understands and accepts it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Be ready to show links, articles, books, reports, examples, etc. Just “&lt;em&gt;I know this because I’ve been writing Java for 15 years&lt;/em&gt;” is not enough. Moreover, this type of argument only makes you less convincing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you don’t have enough convincing proof, think again—maybe you are wrong.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Also, remember that it’s your job to prove that the code you’re reviewing is bad. The author of the code should not prove anything. His code is great by default. The job of the reviewer is to show why and how that’s actually not the case. In other words, you’re the plaintiff and he is the defender. Not the other way around.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;no-offense&quot;&gt;No Offense&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is the last and most difficult principle to follow. No matter how bad the code is and how stubborn your opponent is, you must remain professional. To be honest, I find this very difficult sometimes. At &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zerocracy.com&quot;&gt;Zerocracy&lt;/a&gt;, we’re working in distributed teams and hire a few new people every week. Some of them, despite our &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/10/29/how-much-do-you-cost.html&quot;&gt;screening criteria&lt;/a&gt;, appear to be rather &lt;span class=&quot;strike&quot;&gt;stupid&lt;/span&gt; difficult to deal with.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I encountered a funny situation about a year ago when a new guy was supposed to create a small (20 to 30 lines of code) new feature in an existing Java library. He sent me a pull request (I was a code reviewer) after he put in a few hundred lines of code. That code was absolute garbage and obviously not written by him. I immediately understood that he found it somewhere and copied it. But what could I do? How could I reject it without saying his attitude was unacceptable for a professional developer? I had to spend some time objectively blaming his code for its style, its design, etc. I had to make many serious comments in order to show him that to fix it all, he should delete the garbage and re-write it from scratch. I never saw him again after that task.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;My point is that it’s easy to be professional when you’re dealing with professionals. Unfortunately, that’s not always the case. But no matter how bad the code in front of you is, be patient and convincing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;What do you feel when your pull request is rejected and a lot of &amp;quot;re-work&amp;quot; is required? &lt;a

href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_review">Code reviews</a> (a.k.a. peer reviews) must be a mandatory practice for every serious software development team. I hope there is no debate about this. Some do pre-merge code reviews, <a href="/2014/07/21/read-only-master-branch.html">protecting</a> their master/development branch from accidental mistakes. Others do post-merge <a href="/2014/12/18/independent-technical-reviews.html">regular reviews</a> to discover bugs and inconsistencies after they are introduced by their authors. Some even do both, reviewing before merges and regularly after. Code reviews are very similar to a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White-box_testing">white-box testing</a> technique where a tester looks for defects with full access to the sources of the software. In either case, a code review is a great instrument to increase quality and boost team motivation.</p><p>However, it’s not so simple to do them right. I would even say it’s very easy and comfortable to do them wrong. Most code reviews and reviewers I’ve seen make similar mistakes. That’s why I decided to summarize the four basic principles of a good reviewer as I see them. Hopefully you find them helpful.</p><figure class="jb_picture"><img itemprop="image" alt="Main picture" src="/images/2015/02/kim-jong-un-doing-code-review.png" /></figure><h2 id="no-fear">No Fear</h2><p>There are a few different fears a serious code reviewer should renounce. The first and most popular is the fear of offending an author of the code. “<em>I’d better close my eyes and pretend I didn’t see her bugs today so tomorrow she will ignore my mistakes</em>”—This is the kind of attitude this fear produces. Needless to say, it’s counterproductive and degrades <a href="/2017/04/11/flexibility-equates-lower-quality.html">code quality</a> and team morale. Here is my advice: be direct, honest, and straight-forward. If you don’t like the code, you don’t like it. You shouldn’t care how your opinion will be taken by the author of the code.</p><p>If you do have such feelings toward your colleagues, there is something wrong with the management model. You’re afraid of being rejected by the team for “not being a team player,” which is a label attached to you by the weakest members of the team, not by the project sponsor. The sponsor pays you to produce high-quality software. The sponsor doesn’t care how much your intention to increase quality offends others, who care less. The sponsor wants his money to produce deliverables that can be sold to customers and returned back in profit. The sponsor is not paying you to make friends in the <a href="/2015/10/06/how-to-be-good-office-slave.html">office</a>.</p><p>The next type of fear sounds like this: “<em>If I reject this code, I will delay the release</em>” Again, it goes without saying that such an attitude does a significant disservice to the entire project. You will accept the code and close your eyes to what you don’t like in it. The code will go into the next release, and we’ll ship it sooner. You won’t be a bottleneck, and nobody will say that because of that dogmatic code reviewer, we delayed the release and lost some cash. You will be a good team player, right? Wrong!</p><p>As I’ve <a href="/2015/01/15/how-to-cut-corners.html">mentioned before</a>, a professional team player understands his or her personal role in a project and doesn’t cover anyone’s ass. If the rejection of <a href="/2015/11/24/imprisonment-for-irresponsible-coding.html">bad code</a> delays the release, that’s the fault of its author. Your professional responsibility is to make this fault visible. That’s how you help the team learn and improve.</p><p>I think it’s obvious that the education and improvement of a team first requires getting rid of bad programmers and promoting good ones. Honest and fearless code reviewers help the team learn and improve.</p><p>Yet another fear is expressed like this: “<em>I may be wrong and they will laugh me out</em>” Even worse, they may spot my lack of knowledge. They may see that I don’t know what I’m doing. It would be better to stay quiet and pretend there are no bugs in the code. At least then I wouldn’t embarrass myself with stupid comments. You know that it’s much easier to look smart if you keep your mouth shut, right? Wrong!</p><p>The project is not paying you to look good. You’re getting your paychecks not because the team loves you but because you produce deliverables on a daily basis. Your professional responsibility is to do what’s best for the project and ignore everyone’s opinions, including the opinion of your boss. Similar to <a href="/2015/01/26/happy-boss-false-objective.html">A Happy Boss Is a False Objective</a>, I would say that the respect of the team is a false goal. Don’t try to earn respect. Instead, create clean code and respect will come automatically.</p><p>Let me reiterate: Don’t be afraid to embarrass yourself by making incorrect and stupid comments about someone’s code. Be loyal to the project, not to the expectations of people around you. They expect you to be smart and bright, but the project expects you to say what you think about the code. So screw their opinions; do the right thing and say what you really think.</p><h2 id="no-compromise">No Compromise</h2><p>Okay, you’ve fearlessly said what you thought about the code and simply rejected it. The branch you were reviewing is not good, and you explained why. You asked its author to refactor here and re-write there. What’s next?</p><p>He or she will try to make a deal with you. It’s natural and it’s happening in almost every branch I’m seeing in our teams. The author of the code is also a professional developer, and he also has no fear. So he insists that his implementation approach is right and your ideas are wrong. What should a professional code reviewer do in this case?</p><p>The worst thing (as in any conflict resolution) is a compromise. This is what ruins quality faster than bad code. A compromise is a conflict resolution technique for which both parties agree not to get what they wanted just for the sake of ceasing the conflict. In other words, “<em>Let’s make peace just to stop fighting</em>” It’s the worst approach ever.</p><p>Instead of a lousy compromise, there are three professional exits from a fight over a piece of code:</p><ul> <li><p>“<em>You’re right; I take my comments back!</em>” This may happen, and it should happen very often. You should be ready to admit your mistakes. You didn’t like the code, but its author explained to you its benefits, and you accepted the logic—not because you want to stop fighting with him but because you really understood the logic and accepted it. Willingness to say, “I’m wrong,” is the first sign of a mature and serious developer.</p></li> <li><p>“<em>I will never accept this, period!</em>” Some code deserves that, and there is nothing wrong with resolving a conflict this way. The opponent may accept the situation and re-write everything. And learn something too.</p></li> <li><p>“<em>Let’s do what the architect says!</em>” In every project, there is a <a href="/2014/10/12/who-is-software-architect.html">software architect</a> who makes final decisions. Appeal to his opinion and get his final decision. Invite him into the discussion, and ask him to take one side in the conflict. Once he tells you that you’re wrong, accept the decision and try to learn from it.</p></li></ul><p>Thus, either stand strong on your position and fight for it or admit that you’re wrong. One way or the other. But don’t make a compromise!</p><p>Don’t get me wrong; it’s not about being stubborn and holding your cards no matter how bad they are. Be flexible and learn on the spot.

I hope there is no debate about this. Some do pre-merge code reviews, <a href="/2014/07/21/read-only-master-branch.html">protecting</a> their master/development branch from accidental mistakes. Others do post-merge <a href="/2014/12/18/independent-technical-reviews.html">regular reviews</a> to discover bugs and inconsistencies after they are introduced by their authors. Some even do both, reviewing before merges and regularly after. Code reviews are very similar to a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White-box_testing">white-box testing</a> technique where a tester looks for defects with full access to the sources of the software. In either case, a code review is a great instrument to increase quality and boost team motivation.</p><p>However, it’s not so simple to do them right. I would even say it’s very easy and comfortable to do them wrong. Most code reviews and reviewers I’ve seen make similar mistakes. That’s why I decided to summarize the four basic principles of a good reviewer as I see them. Hopefully you find them helpful.</p><figure class="jb_picture"><img itemprop="image" alt="Main picture" src="/images/2015/02/kim-jong-un-doing-code-review.png" /></figure><h2 id="no-fear">No Fear</h2><p>There are a few different fears a serious code reviewer should renounce. The first and most popular is the fear of offending an author of the code. “<em>I’d better close my eyes and pretend I didn’t see her bugs today so tomorrow she will ignore my mistakes</em>”—This is the kind of attitude this fear produces. Needless to say, it’s counterproductive and degrades <a href="/2017/04/11/flexibility-equates-lower-quality.html">code quality</a> and team morale. Here is my advice: be direct, honest, and straight-forward. If you don’t like the code, you don’t like it. You shouldn’t care how your opinion will be taken by the author of the code.</p><p>If you do have such feelings toward your colleagues, there is something wrong with the management model. You’re afraid of being rejected by the team for “not being a team player,” which is a label attached to you by the weakest members of the team, not by the project sponsor. The sponsor pays you to produce high-quality software. The sponsor doesn’t care how much your intention to increase quality offends others, who care less. The sponsor wants his money to produce deliverables that can be sold to customers and returned back in profit. The sponsor is not paying you to make friends in the <a href="/2015/10/06/how-to-be-good-office-slave.html">office</a>.</p><p>The next type of fear sounds like this: “<em>If I reject this code, I will delay the release</em>” Again, it goes without saying that such an attitude does a significant disservice to the entire project. You will accept the code and close your eyes to what you don’t like in it. The code will go into the next release, and we’ll ship it sooner. You won’t be a bottleneck, and nobody will say that because of that dogmatic code reviewer, we delayed the release and lost some cash. You will be a good team player, right? Wrong!</p><p>As I’ve <a href="/2015/01/15/how-to-cut-corners.html">mentioned before</a>, a professional team player understands his or her personal role in a project and doesn’t cover anyone’s ass. If the rejection of <a href="/2015/11/24/imprisonment-for-irresponsible-coding.html">bad code</a> delays the release, that’s the fault of its author. Your professional responsibility is to make this fault visible. That’s how you help the team learn and improve.</p><p>I think it’s obvious that the education and improvement of a team first requires getting rid of bad programmers and promoting good ones. Honest and fearless code reviewers help the team learn and improve.</p><p>Yet another fear is expressed like this: “<em>I may be wrong and they will laugh me out</em>” Even worse, they may spot my lack of knowledge. They may see that I don’t know what I’m doing. It would be better to stay quiet and pretend there are no bugs in the code. At least then I wouldn’t embarrass myself with stupid comments. You know that it’s much easier to look smart if you keep your mouth shut, right? Wrong!</p><p>The project is not paying you to look good. You’re getting your paychecks not because the team loves you but because you produce deliverables on a daily basis. Your professional responsibility is to do what’s best for the project and ignore everyone’s opinions, including the opinion of your boss. Similar to <a href="/2015/01/26/happy-boss-false-objective.html">A Happy Boss Is a False Objective</a>, I would say that the respect of the team is a false goal. Don’t try to earn respect. Instead, create clean code and respect will come automatically.</p><p>Let me reiterate: Don’t be afraid to embarrass yourself by making incorrect and stupid comments about someone’s code. Be loyal to the project, not to the expectations of people around you. They expect you to be smart and bright, but the project expects you to say what you think about the code. So screw their opinions; do the right thing and say what you really think.</p><h2 id="no-compromise">No Compromise</h2><p>Okay, you’ve fearlessly said what you thought about the code and simply rejected it. The branch you were reviewing is not good, and you explained why. You asked its author to refactor here and re-write there. What’s next?</p><p>He or she will try to make a deal with you. It’s natural and it’s happening in almost every branch I’m seeing in our teams. The author of the code is also a professional developer, and he also has no fear. So he insists that his implementation approach is right and your ideas are wrong. What should a professional code reviewer do in this case?</p><p>The worst thing (as in any conflict resolution) is a compromise. This is what ruins quality faster than bad code. A compromise is a conflict resolution technique for which both parties agree not to get what they wanted just for the sake of ceasing the conflict. In other words, “<em>Let’s make peace just to stop fighting</em>” It’s the worst approach ever.</p><p>Instead of a lousy compromise, there are three professional exits from a fight over a piece of code:</p><ul> <li><p>“<em>You’re right; I take my comments back!</em>” This may happen, and it should happen very often. You should be ready to admit your mistakes. You didn’t like the code, but its author explained to you its benefits, and you accepted the logic—not because you want to stop fighting with him but because you really understood the logic and accepted it. Willingness to say, “I’m wrong,” is the first sign of a mature and serious developer.</p></li> <li><p>“<em>I will never accept this, period!</em>” Some code deserves that, and there is nothing wrong with resolving a conflict this way. The opponent may accept the situation and re-write everything. And learn something too.</p></li> <li><p>“<em>Let’s do what the architect says!</em>” In every project, there is a <a href="/2014/10/12/who-is-software-architect.html">software architect</a> who makes final decisions. Appeal to his opinion and get his final decision. Invite him into the discussion, and ask him to take one side in the conflict. Once he tells you that you’re wrong, accept the decision and try to learn from it.</p></li></ul><p>Thus, either stand strong on your position and fight for it or admit that you’re wrong. One way or the other. But don’t make a compromise!</p><p>Don’t get me wrong; it’s not about being stubborn and holding your cards no matter how bad they are. Be flexible and learn on the spot. Your position may and should change during the negotiation, but don’t accept anything that you don’t like. You can exit the conflict either by being fully convinced that the opponent is right or when the architect says so. Nothing in between.</p><h2 id="no-bullshit">No Bullshit</h2><p>Again, you fearlessly said that a method should be designed differently. Your opponent, the author of the code, replies that he doesn’t think so. You take a look again and decide to stand behind your position. You still think you’re right, and you’re not going to make a compromise. Now what? It’s too early to call an architect, so try to convince your opponent.</p><p>In most cases, convincing is teaching. You know something that he doesn’t know. That’s why he created that method the way you don’t like. One of you needs some additional education. Here is an opportunity for you to be a teacher of your colleague. To be an effective teacher, you need to show proof. You need to ground your logic and make sure he understands and accepts it.</p><p>Be ready to show links, articles, books, reports, examples, etc. Just “<em>I know this because I’ve been writing Java for 15 years</em>” is not enough. Moreover, this type of argument only makes you less convincing.</p><p>If you don’t have enough convincing proof, think again—maybe you are wrong.</p><p>Also, remember that it’s your job to prove that the code you’re reviewing is bad. The author of the code should not prove anything. His code is great by default. The job of the reviewer is to show why and how that’s actually not the case. In other words, you’re the plaintiff and he is the defender. Not the other way around.</p><h2 id="no-offense">No Offense</h2><p>This is the last and most difficult principle to follow. No matter how bad the code is and how stubborn your opponent is, you must remain professional. To be honest, I find this very difficult sometimes. At <a href="https://www.zerocracy.com">Zerocracy</a>, we’re working in distributed teams and hire a few new people every week. Some of them, despite our <a href="/2014/10/29/how-much-do-you-cost.html">screening criteria</a>, appear to be rather <span class="strike">stupid</span> difficult to deal with.</p><p>I encountered a funny situation about a year ago when a new guy was supposed to create a small (20 to 30 lines of code) new feature in an existing Java library. He sent me a pull request (I was a code reviewer) after he put in a few hundred lines of code. That code was absolute garbage and obviously not written by him. I immediately understood that he found it somewhere and copied it. But what could I do? How could I reject it without saying his attitude was unacceptable for a professional developer? I had to spend some time objectively blaming his code for its style, its design, etc. I had to make many serious comments in order to show him that to fix it all, he should delete the garbage and re-write it from scratch. I never saw him again after that task.</p><p>My point is that it’s easy to be professional when you’re dealing with professionals. Unfortunately, that’s not always the case. But no matter how bad the code in front of you is, be patient and convincing.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">What do you feel when your pull request is rejected and a lot of &quot;re-work&quot; is required? <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/sociotech?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#sociotech</a></p>--- Yegor Bugayenko (@yegor256) <a href="https://twitter.com/yegor256/status/1013385039701250048?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 1, 2018</a></blockquote> <script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div></article></div><div class="wrapper"> <related-posts /></div><div class="disqus" role="complementary"><p class="disqus_hint"> Please, use <a href="https://help.disqus.com/commenting/what-html-tags-are-allowed-within-comments">syntax highlighting</a> in your comments, to make them more readable.</p><div id="disqus_thread" class="disqus-thread"> <a>&nbsp;</a></div><script> var disqus_config = function () { this.page.url = document.location.href.split('?')[0].split('#')[0].replace('https://', 'http://'); this.page.identifier = this.page.url; }; (function() { var d = document, s = d.createElement('script'); s.src = '//yegor256.disqus.com/embed.js'; s.setAttribute('data-timestamp', +new Date()); (d.head || d.body).appendChild(s); })(); </script> <noscript><div><p class="red"> JavaScript is disabled in your browser, that's why you can't see comments under this post.</p></div></noscript></div><div class="wrapper"> <footer class="footer"><p> &copy; <span itemscope="" itemprop="copyrightHolder" itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"> <span itemprop="name">Yegor Bugayenko</span> </span> 2014&ndash;<span itemprop="copyrightYear">2018</span></p></footer></div></section><div class="wrapper unprintable" style="text-align:center;margin-top:2em;"> <a href="http://www.sixnines.io/h/3ba1652f"> <img src="//www.sixnines.io/b/3ba1652f?style=flat" alt="sixnines availability badge"/> </a></div><script src="//code.jquery.com/jquery-1.9.0.min.js"></script> <script src="/js/all.js?8c0c9d2d5e8"></script> <script>var disqus_shortname = 'yegor256';</script> <script id="dsq-count-scr" src="//yegor256.disqus.com/count.js" async="async"></script> <script> (function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){ (i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o), m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m) })(window,document,'script','//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga'); ga('create', 'UA-1963507-32', 'auto'); ga('send', 'pageview'); </script> <script> Cd=document;Cr="&"+Math.random();Cp="&s=1"; Cd.cookie="b=b";if(Cd.cookie)Cp+="&c=1"; Cp+="&t="+(new Date()).getTimezoneOffset(); if(self!=top)Cp+="&f=1"; </script> <script> if(navigator.javaEnabled())Cp+="&j=1"; </script> <script> if(typeof(screen)!='undefined')Cp+="&w="+screen.width+"&h="+ screen.height+"&d="+(screen.colorDepth?screen.colorDepth:screen.pixelDepth); </script> <script> Cd.write("<img src='//c.hit.ua/hit?i=95870&g=0&x=2"+Cp+Cr+ "&r="+escape(Cd.referrer)+"&u="+escape(window.location.href)+ "' border='0' wi"+"dth='1' he"+"ight='1'/>"); </script> <script type="application/ld+json"> { "@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Person", "name": "Yegor Bugayenko", "url": "https://www.yegor256.com", "sameAs": [ "https://www.facebook.com/yegor256", "https://instagram.com/yegor256", "https://www.linkedin.com/in/yegor256", "https://twitter.com/yegor256", "https://github.com/yegor256", "https://www.pinterest.com/yegor256/" ] } </script> </body> </html> <!DOCTYPE html> <html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/WebSite"> <head> <meta charset="utf-8"/> <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;You have a task assigned to you, and you don’t like it.

Here are some tips I recommend to my peers who code with me in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zerocracy.com&quot;&gt;Zerocracy&lt;/a&gt; projects. In a nutshell, I’m going to explain how you can &lt;em&gt;cut corners&lt;/em&gt; and remain professional, 1) protecting your nerves, 2) optimizing your project’s expenses, and 3) increasing the quality of the source code.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;youtube&quot;&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6r2W3P9vgY&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;box&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://i.ytimg.com/vi/b6r2W3P9vgY/mqdefault.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;YouTube video #b6r2W3P9vgY&quot; /&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;play&quot;&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;icon icon-play&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;div&gt;Blame the Project; 16 April 2016.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;Here is a list of options you have, in order of preference. I would recommend you start with the first one on the list and proceed down when you have to.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;create-dependencies-blame-them-and-wait&quot;&gt;Create Dependencies, Blame Them, and Wait&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is the first and most preferable option. If you can’t figure out how to fix an issue or how to implement a new feature, it’s a fault of the project, not you. Even if you can’t figure it out because you don’t know anything about Ruby and they hired you to fix bugs in a Ruby on Rails code base—it’s their fault. Why did they hire you when you know nothing about Ruby?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So be positive; don’t blame yourself. If you don’t know how this damn code works, it’s a fault of the code, not you. Good code is easy to understand and maintain.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;badge&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.yegor256.com/images/2015/01/cut-corners-1.png&quot; style=&quot;width:250px;max-width:100%;&quot; alt=&quot;badge&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Don’t try to eat spaghetti code; complain to the chef and ask him or her to cook something better (BTW, I love spaghetti).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;How can you do that? Create dependencies—new bugs complaining about unclear design, lack of unit tests, absence of necessary classes, or whatever. Be creative and offensive—in a constructive and professional way, of course. Don’t get personal. No matter who cooked that spaghetti, you have nothing against him or her personally. You just want another dish, that’s all.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;If you don't know how this damn code works, it's a fault of the code, not you.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;Once you have those dependencies reported, explain in the main ticket that you can’t continue until all of them are resolved. You will legally stop working, and someone else will improve the code you need. Later, when all dependencies are resolved and the code looks better, try to get back to it again. If you still see issues, create new dependencies. Keep doing this until the code in front of you is clean and easy to fix.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Don’t be &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/12/29/turnover-is-good-for-maintainability.html&quot;&gt;a hero&lt;/a&gt;—don’t rush into fixing the &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/11/24/imprisonment-for-irresponsible-coding.html&quot;&gt;bad code&lt;/a&gt; you inherited. Think &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/10/26/hacker-vs-programmer-mentality.html&quot;&gt;like a developer, not a hacker&lt;/a&gt;. Remember that your first and most important responsibility as a disciplined engineer is to help the project &lt;em&gt;reveal&lt;/em&gt; maintainability issues. Who will fix them and how is the responsibility of a &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/05/24/who-is-project-manager.html&quot;&gt;project manager&lt;/a&gt;. Your job is to reveal, not to hide. By being a hero and trying to fix everything in the scope of a single task, you’re not doing the project a favor—you’re concealing the problem(s).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Edit: Another good example of a dependency may be a question raised at, for example, &lt;a href=&quot;/2017/02/14/stackoverflow-is-your-tool.html&quot;&gt;StackOverflow&lt;/a&gt; or a user list of a third-party library. If you can’t find a solution yourself and the problem is outside of the scope of your project—submit a question to SO and put its link to the source code (in JavaDoc block, for example).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;demand-better-documentation-and-wait&quot;&gt;Demand Better Documentation and Wait&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;All dependencies are resolved and the code looks clean, but you still don’t understand how to fix the problem or implement a new feature. It’s too complex. Or maybe you just don’t know how this library works. Or you’ve never done anything like that before. Anyhow, you can’t continue because you don’t understand. And in order to understand, you will need a lot of time—much more than you have from your project manager or your Scrum board. What do you do?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;badge&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.yegor256.com/images/2015/01/cut-corners-2.png&quot; style=&quot;width:250px;max-width:100%;&quot; alt=&quot;badge&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Again, think positively and don’t blame yourself. If the software is not clear enough for a total stranger, it’s “their” fault, not yours. They created the software in a way that’s difficult to digest and modify. But the code is clean; it’s not spaghetti anymore. It’s a perfectly cooked lobster, but you don’t know how to eat lobster! You’ve never ate it before.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The chef did a good job; he cooked it well, but the restaurant didn’t give you any instructions on how to eat such a sophisticated dish. What do you do?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You ask for a manual. You ask for documentation. Properly designed and written source code must be properly documented. Once you see that something is not clear for you, create new dependencies that ask for better documentation of certain aspects of the code.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Again, don’t be a hero and try to understand everything yourself. Of course you’re a smart guy, but the project doesn’t need a single smart guy. The project needs &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/12/29/turnover-is-good-for-maintainability.html&quot;&gt;maintainable code&lt;/a&gt; that is easy to modify, even by someone who is not as smart as yourself. So do your project a favor: reveal the documentation issue, and ask someone to fix it for you. Not just for you, for everybody. The entire team will benefit from such a request. Once the documentation is fixed, you will continue with your task, and everybody will get source code that is a bit better than it was before. Win-win, isn’t it?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;reproduce-the-bug-and-call-it-a-day&quot;&gt;Reproduce the Bug and Call It a Day&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now the code is clean, the documentation is good enough, but you’re stuck anyway. What to do? Well, I’m a big fan of test-driven development, so my next suggestion would be to create a test that reproduces the bug. Basically, this is what you should start every ticket with, be it a bug or a feature. Catch the bug with a unit test! Prove that the bug exists by failing the build with a new test.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;badge&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/1SdcZ8M&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.yegor256.com/images/2015/01/working-effectively-with-legacy-code.png&quot; style=&quot;width:96px;max-width:100%;&quot; alt=&quot;badge&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;This may be rather difficult to achieve, especially when the software you’re trying to fix or modify was written by &lt;span class=&quot;strike&quot;&gt;idiots&lt;/span&gt; someone who had no idea about unit testing. There are plenty of techniques that may help you find a way to make such software more testable. I would highly recommend you read &lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/1SdcZ8M&quot;&gt;Working Effectively with Legacy Code&lt;/a&gt; by Michael Feathers. There are many different patterns, and most of them work.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Catching a bug with a unit test is, in most cases, more than 80% of success.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;Once you manage to reproduce the bug and the build fails, stop right there. That’s more than enough for a single piece of work. Skip the test (for example, using &lt;code&gt;@Ignore&lt;/code&gt; annotation in JUnit 4) and commit your changes. Then add documentation to the unit test you just created, preferably in the form of a &lt;code&gt;@todo&lt;/code&gt;. Explain there that you managed to reproduce the problem but didn’t have enough time to fix it. Or maybe you just don’t know how to fix it. Be honest and give all possible details.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I believe that catching a bug with a unit test is, in most cases, more than 80% of success. The rest is way more simple: just fix the code and make the test pass. Leave this job to someone else.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;prove-a-bugs-absence&quot;&gt;Prove a Bug’s Absence&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Very often you simply can’t reproduce a bug. That’s not because the code is not testable and can’t be used in a unit test but because you can’t reproduce an error situation. You know that the code crashes in production, but you can’t crash it in a test. The error stack trace reported by the end user or your production logging system is not reproducible. It’s a very common situation. What do you do?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;badge&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.yegor256.com/images/2015/01/cut-corners-3.png&quot; style=&quot;width:250px;max-width:100%;&quot; alt=&quot;badge&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;I think the best option here is to create a test that will prove that the code works as intended. The test won’t fail, and the build will remain clean. You will commit it to the repository and … report that the problem is solved. You will say that the reported bug doesn’t really exist in real life. You will state that there is no bug—“our software works correctly; here is the proof: see my new unit test.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Will they believe you? I don’t think so, but they don’t have a choice. They can’t push you any further. You’ve already done something—created a new test that proves everything is fine. The ticket will be closed and the project will move on.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;youtube&quot;&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBQoTZ-1X-o&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;box&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YBQoTZ-1X-o/mqdefault.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;YouTube video #YBQoTZ-1X-o&quot; /&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;play&quot;&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;icon icon-play&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;div&gt;How to Cut Corners and Stay Cool (webinar #15); 1 June 2016.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;If, later on, the same problem occurs in production, a new bug will be reported. It will be linked to your ticket. Your experience will help someone investigate the bug further. Maybe that guy will also fail to catch the bug with a test and will also create a new, successful and “useless” test. And this may happen again and again. Eventually, this cumulative group experience will help the last guy catch the bug and fix it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thus, a new passing test is a good response to a bug that you can’t catch with a unit test.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;disable-the-feature&quot;&gt;Disable the Feature&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sometimes the unit test technique won’t work, mostly because a bug will be too important to be ignored. They won’t agree with you when you show them a unit test that proves the bug doesn’t exist. They will tell you that “when our users are trying to download a PDF, they get a blank page.” And they will also say they don’t really care about your bloody unit tests. All they care about is that PDF document that should be downloadable. So the trick with a unit test won’t work. What do you do?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Production errors are not programmers' mistakes, though delayed tickets are.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;It depends on many factors, and most of these factors are not technical. They are political, organizational, managerial, social, you name it. However, in most cases, I would recommend you disable that toxic feature, release a new version, and close the ticket.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You will take the problem off your shoulders and everybody will be pleased. Well, except that poor end user. But this is not your problem. This is the fault of management, which didn’t organize pre-production testing properly. Again, don’t take this blame on yourself. Your job is to keep the code clean and finish your tickets in a reasonable amount of time. Their job is to make sure that developers, testers, DevOps, marketers, product managers, and designers work together to deliver the product with an acceptable number of errors.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Production errors are not programmers’ mistakes, though delayed tickets are. If you keep a ticket in your hands for too long, you become an unmanageable unit of work. They simply can’t manage you anymore. You’re doing something, trying to fix the bug, saying “I’m trying, I’m trying …” How can they manage such a guy? Instead, you should deliver quickly, even if it comes at the cost of a temporarily disabled feature.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;say-no&quot;&gt;Say No&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;OK, let’s say none of the above works. The code is clean, the documentation is acceptable, but you can’t catch the bug, and they don’t accept a unit test from you as proof of the bug’s absence. They also don’t allow you to disable a feature, because it is critical to the user experience. What choices do you have? Just one.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;badge&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.yegor256.com/images/2015/01/cut-corners-4.png&quot; style=&quot;width:250px;max-width:100%;&quot; alt=&quot;badge&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Be professional and say “No, I can’t do this; find someone else.” Being a professional developer doesn’t mean being able to fix any problem. Instead, it means honesty. If you see that you can’t fix the problem, say so as soon as possible. Let them decide what to do. If they eventually decide to fire you because of that, you will remain a professional. They will remember you as a guy who was honest and took his reputation seriously. In the end, you will win.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Don’t hold the task in your hands. The minute you realize you’re not the best guy for it or you simply can’t fix it—notify your manager. Make it his problem. Actually, it is his problem in the first place. He hired you. He &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/03/01/how-we-interview-programmers.html&quot;&gt;interviewed&lt;/a&gt; you. He decided to give you this task. He estimated your abilities and your skills. So it’s payback time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Being a professional developer doesn't mean being able to fix any problem.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;Your “No!” will be very valuable feedback for him. It will help him make his next important management decisions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On the other hand, if you lie just to give the impression you’re a guy who can fix anything and yet fail in the end, you will damage not only your reputation but also the project’s performance and objectives.&lt;/p&gt; " /> <meta name="keywords" content="next, path, output, content, previous, url, relative_path, id, collection, excerpt, draft, categories, layout, title, date, tags, description, keywords, translated, image, jb_picture, slug, ext" /> <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1"/> <meta name="google-site-verification" content="JEj_gQr2CPe2QKGw8XdMz0R7VboQIUbX3FlM-lwTq-8" /> <meta name="author" content="Yegor Bugayenko"> <meta name="article:published_time" content="2015-01-15 00:00:00 +0000"> <meta name="og:site_name" content="Yegor Bugayenko"/> <meta name="og:type" content="article" /> <meta name="og:locale" content="en_US" /> <meta name="twitter:account_id" content="4503599630178231" /> <meta name="twitter:creator" content="@yegor256"/> <meta name="twitter:site" content="@yegor256"/> <meta name="twitter:title" property="og:title" content="How to Cut Corners and Stay Cool"/> <meta name="twitter:description" property="og:description" content="&lt;p&gt;You have a task assigned to you, and you don’t like it. You are simply not in the mood. You don’t know how to fix that damn bug. You have no idea how that bloody module was designed, and you don’t know how it works. But you have to fix the issue, which was reported by someone who has no clue how this software works. You get frustrated and blame that &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/09/22/micromanagement.html&quot;&gt;stupid project manager&lt;/a&gt; and programmers who were fired two years ago. You spend hours just to find out how the code works. Then even more hours trying to fix it. In the end, you miss the deadline and &lt;em&gt;everybody blames you&lt;/em&gt;. Been there, done that?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;!--more--&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;jb_picture&quot;&gt;&lt;img itemprop=&quot;image&quot; alt=&quot;Regarding Henry (1991) by Mike Nichols&quot; src=&quot;/images/2015/01/regarding-henry.jpg&quot; longdesc=&quot;#34ee5620&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption id=&quot;34ee5620&quot;&gt;Regarding Henry (1991) by Mike Nichols&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;There is, however, an alternative approach that provides a professional exit from this situation. Here are some tips I recommend to my peers who code with me in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zerocracy.com&quot;&gt;Zerocracy&lt;/a&gt; projects. In a nutshell, I’m going to explain how you can &lt;em&gt;cut corners&lt;/em&gt; and remain professional, 1) protecting your nerves, 2) optimizing your project’s expenses, and 3) increasing the quality of the source code.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;youtube&quot;&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6r2W3P9vgY&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;box&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://i.ytimg.com/vi/b6r2W3P9vgY/mqdefault.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;YouTube video #b6r2W3P9vgY&quot; /&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;play&quot;&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;icon icon-play&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;div&gt;Blame the Project; 16 April 2016.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;Here is a list of options you have, in order of preference. I would recommend you start with the first one on the list and proceed down when you have to.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;create-dependencies-blame-them-and-wait&quot;&gt;Create Dependencies, Blame Them, and Wait&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is the first and most preferable option. If you can’t figure out how to fix an issue or how to implement a new feature, it’s a fault of the project, not you. Even if you can’t figure it out because you don’t know anything about Ruby and they hired you to fix bugs in a Ruby on Rails code base—it’s their fault. Why did they hire you when you know nothing about Ruby?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So be positive; don’t blame yourself. If you don’t know how this damn code works, it’s a fault of the code, not you. Good code is easy to understand and maintain.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;badge&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.yegor256.com/images/2015/01/cut-corners-1.png&quot; style=&quot;width:250px;max-width:100%;&quot; alt=&quot;badge&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Don’t try to eat spaghetti code; complain to the chef and ask him or her to cook something better (BTW, I love spaghetti).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;How can you do that? Create dependencies—new bugs complaining about unclear design, lack of unit tests, absence of necessary classes, or whatever. Be creative and offensive—in a constructive and professional way, of course. Don’t get personal. No matter who cooked that spaghetti, you have nothing against him or her personally. You just want another dish, that’s all.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;If you don't know how this damn code works, it's a fault of the code, not you.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;Once you have those dependencies reported, explain in the main ticket that you can’t continue until all of them are resolved. You will legally stop working, and someone else will improve the code you need. Later, when all dependencies are resolved and the code looks better, try to get back to it again. If you still see issues, create new dependencies. Keep doing this until the code in front of you is clean and easy to fix.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Don’t be &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/12/29/turnover-is-good-for-maintainability.html&quot;&gt;a hero&lt;/a&gt;—don’t rush into fixing the &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/11/24/imprisonment-for-irresponsible-coding.html&quot;&gt;bad code&lt;/a&gt; you inherited. Think &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/10/26/hacker-vs-programmer-mentality.html&quot;&gt;like a developer, not a hacker&lt;/a&gt;. Remember that your first and most important responsibility as a disciplined engineer is to help the project &lt;em&gt;reveal&lt;/em&gt; maintainability issues. Who will fix them and how is the responsibility of a &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/05/24/who-is-project-manager.html&quot;&gt;project manager&lt;/a&gt;. Your job is to reveal, not to hide. By being a hero and trying to fix everything in the scope of a single task, you’re not doing the project a favor—you’re concealing the problem(s).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Edit: Another good example of a dependency may be a question raised at, for example, &lt;a href=&quot;/2017/02/14/stackoverflow-is-your-tool.html&quot;&gt;StackOverflow&lt;/a&gt; or a user list of a third-party library. If you can’t find a solution yourself and the problem is outside of the scope of your project—submit a question to SO and put its link to the source code (in JavaDoc block, for example).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;demand-better-documentation-and-wait&quot;&gt;Demand Better Documentation and Wait&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;All dependencies are resolved and the code looks clean, but you still don’t understand how to fix the problem or implement a new feature. It’s too complex. Or maybe you just don’t know how this library works. Or you’ve never done anything like that before. Anyhow, you can’t continue because you don’t understand. And in order to understand, you will need a lot of time—much more than you have from your project manager or your Scrum board. What do you do?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;badge&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.yegor256.com/images/2015/01/cut-corners-2.png&quot; style=&quot;width:250px;max-width:100%;&quot; alt=&quot;badge&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Again, think positively and don’t blame yourself. If the software is not clear enough for a total stranger, it’s “their” fault, not yours. They created the software in a way that’s difficult to digest and modify. But the code is clean; it’s not spaghetti anymore. It’s a perfectly cooked lobster, but you don’t know how to eat lobster! You’ve never ate it before.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The chef did a good job; he cooked it well, but the restaurant didn’t give you any instructions on how to eat such a sophisticated dish. What do you do?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You ask for a manual. You ask for documentation. Properly designed and written source code must be properly documented. Once you see that something is not clear for you, create new dependencies that ask for better documentation of certain aspects of the code.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Again, don’t be a hero and try to understand everything yourself. Of course you’re a smart guy, but the project doesn’t need a single smart guy. The project needs &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/12/29/turnover-is-good-for-maintainability.html&quot;&gt;maintainable code&lt;/a&gt; that is easy to modify, even by someone who is not as smart as yourself. So do your project a favor: reveal the documentation issue, and ask someone to fix it for you. Not just for you, for everybody. The entire team will benefit from such a request. Once the documentation is fixed, you will continue with your task, and everybody will get source code that is a bit better than it was before. Win-win, isn’t it?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;reproduce-the-bug-and-call-it-a-day&quot;&gt;Reproduce the Bug and Call It a Day&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now the code is clean, the documentation is good enough, but you’re stuck anyway. What to do? Well, I’m a big fan of test-driven development, so my next suggestion would be to create a test that reproduces the bug. Basically, this is what you should start every ticket with, be it a bug or a feature. Catch the bug with a unit test! Prove that the bug exists by failing the build with a new test.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;badge&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/1SdcZ8M&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.yegor256.com/images/2015/01/working-effectively-with-legacy-code.png&quot; style=&quot;width:96px;max-width:100%;&quot; alt=&quot;badge&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;This may be rather difficult to achieve, especially when the software you’re trying to fix or modify was written by &lt;span class=&quot;strike&quot;&gt;idiots&lt;/span&gt; someone who had no idea about unit testing. There are plenty of techniques that may help you find a way to make such software more testable. I would highly recommend you read &lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/1SdcZ8M&quot;&gt;Working Effectively with Legacy Code&lt;/a&gt; by Michael Feathers. There are many different patterns, and most of them work.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Catching a bug with a unit test is, in most cases, more than 80% of success.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;Once you manage to reproduce the bug and the build fails, stop right there.

You are simply not in the mood. You don’t know how to fix that damn bug. You have no idea how that bloody module was designed, and you don’t know how it works. But you have to fix the issue, which was reported by someone who has no clue how this software works. You get frustrated and blame that <a href="/2015/09/22/micromanagement.html">stupid project manager</a> and programmers who were fired two years ago. You spend hours just to find out how the code works. Then even more hours trying to fix it. In the end, you miss the deadline and <em>everybody blames you</em>. Been there, done that?</p><figure class="jb_picture"><img itemprop="image" alt="Regarding Henry (1991) by Mike Nichols" src="/images/2015/01/regarding-henry.jpg" longdesc="#34ee5620" /><figcaption id="34ee5620">Regarding Henry (1991) by Mike Nichols</figcaption></figure><p>There is, however, an alternative approach that provides a professional exit from this situation. Here are some tips I recommend to my peers who code with me in <a href="https://www.zerocracy.com">Zerocracy</a> projects. In a nutshell, I’m going to explain how you can <em>cut corners</em> and remain professional, 1) protecting your nerves, 2) optimizing your project’s expenses, and 3) increasing the quality of the source code.</p><aside class="youtube"> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6r2W3P9vgY"><div class="box"> <img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/b6r2W3P9vgY/mqdefault.jpg" alt="YouTube video #b6r2W3P9vgY" /><div class="play"><i class="icon icon-play"></i></div></div></a><div>Blame the Project; 16 April 2016.</div></aside><p>Here is a list of options you have, in order of preference. I would recommend you start with the first one on the list and proceed down when you have to.</p><h2 id="create-dependencies-blame-them-and-wait">Create Dependencies, Blame Them, and Wait</h2><p>This is the first and most preferable option. If you can’t figure out how to fix an issue or how to implement a new feature, it’s a fault of the project, not you. Even if you can’t figure it out because you don’t know anything about Ruby and they hired you to fix bugs in a Ruby on Rails code base—it’s their fault. Why did they hire you when you know nothing about Ruby?</p><p>So be positive; don’t blame yourself. If you don’t know how this damn code works, it’s a fault of the code, not you. Good code is easy to understand and maintain.</p><figure class="badge"><img src="https://www.yegor256.com/images/2015/01/cut-corners-1.png" style="width:250px;max-width:100%;" alt="badge" /></figure><p>Don’t try to eat spaghetti code; complain to the chef and ask him or her to cook something better (BTW, I love spaghetti).</p><p>How can you do that? Create dependencies—new bugs complaining about unclear design, lack of unit tests, absence of necessary classes, or whatever. Be creative and offensive—in a constructive and professional way, of course. Don’t get personal. No matter who cooked that spaghetti, you have nothing against him or her personally. You just want another dish, that’s all.</p><aside class="quote">If you don't know how this damn code works, it's a fault of the code, not you.</aside><p>Once you have those dependencies reported, explain in the main ticket that you can’t continue until all of them are resolved. You will legally stop working, and someone else will improve the code you need. Later, when all dependencies are resolved and the code looks better, try to get back to it again. If you still see issues, create new dependencies. Keep doing this until the code in front of you is clean and easy to fix.</p><p>Don’t be <a href="/2015/12/29/turnover-is-good-for-maintainability.html">a hero</a>—don’t rush into fixing the <a href="/2015/11/24/imprisonment-for-irresponsible-coding.html">bad code</a> you inherited. Think <a href="/2014/10/26/hacker-vs-programmer-mentality.html">like a developer, not a hacker</a>. Remember that your first and most important responsibility as a disciplined engineer is to help the project <em>reveal</em> maintainability issues. Who will fix them and how is the responsibility of a <a href="/2016/05/24/who-is-project-manager.html">project manager</a>. Your job is to reveal, not to hide. By being a hero and trying to fix everything in the scope of a single task, you’re not doing the project a favor—you’re concealing the problem(s).</p><p>Edit: Another good example of a dependency may be a question raised at, for example, <a href="/2017/02/14/stackoverflow-is-your-tool.html">StackOverflow</a> or a user list of a third-party library. If you can’t find a solution yourself and the problem is outside of the scope of your project—submit a question to SO and put its link to the source code (in JavaDoc block, for example).</p><h2 id="demand-better-documentation-and-wait">Demand Better Documentation and Wait</h2><p>All dependencies are resolved and the code looks clean, but you still don’t understand how to fix the problem or implement a new feature. It’s too complex. Or maybe you just don’t know how this library works. Or you’ve never done anything like that before. Anyhow, you can’t continue because you don’t understand. And in order to understand, you will need a lot of time—much more than you have from your project manager or your Scrum board. What do you do?</p><figure class="badge"><img src="https://www.yegor256.com/images/2015/01/cut-corners-2.png" style="width:250px;max-width:100%;" alt="badge" /></figure><p>Again, think positively and don’t blame yourself. If the software is not clear enough for a total stranger, it’s “their” fault, not yours. They created the software in a way that’s difficult to digest and modify. But the code is clean; it’s not spaghetti anymore. It’s a perfectly cooked lobster, but you don’t know how to eat lobster! You’ve never ate it before.</p><p>The chef did a good job; he cooked it well, but the restaurant didn’t give you any instructions on how to eat such a sophisticated dish. What do you do?</p><p>You ask for a manual. You ask for documentation. Properly designed and written source code must be properly documented. Once you see that something is not clear for you, create new dependencies that ask for better documentation of certain aspects of the code.</p><p>Again, don’t be a hero and try to understand everything yourself. Of course you’re a smart guy, but the project doesn’t need a single smart guy. The project needs <a href="/2015/12/29/turnover-is-good-for-maintainability.html">maintainable code</a> that is easy to modify, even by someone who is not as smart as yourself. So do your project a favor: reveal the documentation issue, and ask someone to fix it for you. Not just for you, for everybody. The entire team will benefit from such a request. Once the documentation is fixed, you will continue with your task, and everybody will get source code that is a bit better than it was before. Win-win, isn’t it?</p><h2 id="reproduce-the-bug-and-call-it-a-day">Reproduce the Bug and Call It a Day</h2><p>Now the code is clean, the documentation is good enough, but you’re stuck anyway. What to do? Well, I’m a big fan of test-driven development, so my next suggestion would be to create a test that reproduces the bug. Basically, this is what you should start every ticket with, be it a bug or a feature. Catch the bug with a unit test! Prove that the bug exists by failing the build with a new test.</p><figure class="badge"><a href="http://amzn.to/1SdcZ8M"><img src="https://www.yegor256.com/images/2015/01/working-effectively-with-legacy-code.png" style="width:96px;max-width:100%;" alt="badge" /></a></figure><p>This may be rather difficult to achieve, especially when the software you’re trying to fix or modify was written by <span class="strike">idiots</span> someone who had no idea about unit testing. There are plenty of techniques that may help you find a way to make such software more testable. I would highly recommend you read <a href="http://amzn.to/1SdcZ8M">Working Effectively with Legacy Code</a> by Michael Feathers. There are many different patterns, and most of them work.</p><aside class="quote">Catching a bug with a unit test is, in most cases, more than 80% of success.</aside><p>Once you manage to reproduce the bug and the build fails, stop right there. That’s more than enough for a single piece of work. Skip the test (for example, using <code>@Ignore</code> annotation in JUnit 4) and commit your changes. Then add documentation to the unit test you just created, preferably in the form of a <code>@todo</code>. Explain there that you managed to reproduce the problem but didn’t have enough time to fix it. Or maybe you just don’t know how to fix it. Be honest and give all possible details.</p><p>I believe that catching a bug with a unit test is, in most cases, more than 80% of success. The rest is way more simple: just fix the code and make the test pass. Leave this job to someone else.</p><h2 id="prove-a-bugs-absence">Prove a Bug’s Absence</h2><p>Very often you simply can’t reproduce a bug. That’s not because the code is not testable and can’t be used in a unit test but because you can’t reproduce an error situation. You know that the code crashes in production, but you can’t crash it in a test. The error stack trace reported by the end user or your production logging system is not reproducible. It’s a very common situation. What do you do?</p><figure class="badge"><img src="https://www.yegor256.com/images/2015/01/cut-corners-3.png" style="width:250px;max-width:100%;" alt="badge" /></figure><p>I think the best option here is to create a test that will prove that the code works as intended. The test won’t fail, and the build will remain clean. You will commit it to the repository and … report that the problem is solved. You will say that the reported bug doesn’t really exist in real life. You will state that there is no bug—“our software works correctly; here is the proof: see my new unit test.”</p><p>Will they believe you? I don’t think so, but they don’t have a choice. They can’t push you any further. You’ve already done something—created a new test that proves everything is fine. The ticket will be closed and the project will move on.</p><aside class="youtube"> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBQoTZ-1X-o"><div class="box"> <img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YBQoTZ-1X-o/mqdefault.jpg" alt="YouTube video #YBQoTZ-1X-o" /><div class="play"><i class="icon icon-play"></i></div></div></a><div>How to Cut Corners and Stay Cool (webinar #15); 1 June 2016.</div></aside><p>If, later on, the same problem occurs in production, a new bug will be reported. It will be linked to your ticket. Your experience will help someone investigate the bug further. Maybe that guy will also fail to catch the bug with a test and will also create a new, successful and “useless” test. And this may happen again and again. Eventually, this cumulative group experience will help the last guy catch the bug and fix it.</p><p>Thus, a new passing test is a good response to a bug that you can’t catch with a unit test.</p><h2 id="disable-the-feature">Disable the Feature</h2><p>Sometimes the unit test technique won’t work, mostly because a bug will be too important to be ignored. They won’t agree with you when you show them a unit test that proves the bug doesn’t exist. They will tell you that “when our users are trying to download a PDF, they get a blank page.” And they will also say they don’t really care about your bloody unit tests. All they care about is that PDF document that should be downloadable. So the trick with a unit test won’t work. What do you do?</p><aside class="quote">Production errors are not programmers' mistakes, though delayed tickets are.</aside><p>It depends on many factors, and most of these factors are not technical. They are political, organizational, managerial, social, you name it. However, in most cases, I would recommend you disable that toxic feature, release a new version, and close the ticket.</p><p>You will take the problem off your shoulders and everybody will be pleased. Well, except that poor end user. But this is not your problem. This is the fault of management, which didn’t organize pre-production testing properly. Again, don’t take this blame on yourself. Your job is to keep the code clean and finish your tickets in a reasonable amount of time. Their job is to make sure that developers, testers, DevOps, marketers, product managers, and designers work together to deliver the product with an acceptable number of errors.</p><p>Production errors are not programmers’ mistakes, though delayed tickets are. If you keep a ticket in your hands for too long, you become an unmanageable unit of work. They simply can’t manage you anymore. You’re doing something, trying to fix the bug, saying “I’m trying, I’m trying …” How can they manage such a guy? Instead, you should deliver quickly, even if it comes at the cost of a temporarily disabled feature.</p><h2 id="say-no">Say No</h2><p>OK, let’s say none of the above works. The code is clean, the documentation is acceptable, but you can’t catch the bug, and they don’t accept a unit test from you as proof of the bug’s absence. They also don’t allow you to disable a feature, because it is critical to the user experience. What choices do you have? Just one.</p><figure class="badge"><img src="https://www.yegor256.com/images/2015/01/cut-corners-4.png" style="width:250px;max-width:100%;" alt="badge" /></figure><p>Be professional and say “No, I can’t do this; find someone else.” Being a professional developer doesn’t mean being able to fix any problem. Instead, it means honesty. If you see that you can’t fix the problem, say so as soon as possible. Let them decide what to do. If they eventually decide to fire you because of that, you will remain a professional. They will remember you as a guy who was honest and took his reputation seriously. In the end, you will win.</p><p>Don’t hold the task in your hands. The minute you realize you’re not the best guy for it or you simply can’t fix it—notify your manager. Make it his problem. Actually, it is his problem in the first place. He hired you. He <a href="/2016/03/01/how-we-interview-programmers.html">interviewed</a> you. He decided to give you this task. He estimated your abilities and your skills. So it’s payback time.</p><aside class="quote">Being a professional developer doesn't mean being able to fix any problem.</aside><p>Your “No!” will be very valuable feedback for him. It will help him make his next important management decisions.</p><p>On the other hand, if you lie just to give the impression you’re a guy who can fix anything and yet fail in the end, you will damage not only your reputation but also the project’s performance and objectives.</p></p><nav class="buttons notranslate desktop-only"> <a href="http://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://www.yegor256.com/2015/01/15/how-to-cut-corners.html" title="Share on Facebook" class="button" rel="nofollow"> <span class="count count-facebook">0</span> <i class="icon icon-facebook notranslate" aria-hidden="true"></i> </a> <a href="https://twitter.com/share?url=https://www.yegor256.com/2015/01/15/how-to-cut-corners.html&amp;text=How+to+Cut+Corners+and+Stay+Cool" title="Share on Twitter" class="button" rel="nofollow"> <span class="count count-twitter">0</span> <i class="icon icon-twitter notranslate" aria-hidden="true"></i> </a> <a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=https://www.yegor256.com/2015/01/15/how-to-cut-corners.html" title="Share on Google+" class="button" rel="nofollow"> <span class="count count-googleplus">0</span> <i class="icon icon-googleplus notranslate" aria-hidden="true"></i> </a> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/cws/share?url=https://www.yegor256.com/2015/01/15/how-to-cut-corners.html" title="Share on LinkedIn" class="button" rel="nofollow"> <span class="count count-linkedin">0</span> <i class="icon icon-linkedin notranslate" aria-hidden="true"></i> </a> <a href="http://reddit.com/submit?url=https://www.yegor256.com/2015/01/15/how-to-cut-corners.html%3F2015-02&amp;title=How+to+Cut+Corners+and+Stay+Cool" title="Share on Reddit" class="button" rel="nofollow"> <span class="count count-reddit">0</span> <i class="icon icon-reddit notranslate" aria-hidden="true"></i> </a> <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/submitlink?u=https://www.yegor256.com/2015/01/15/how-to-cut-corners.html%3F2015-02&amp;t=How+to+Cut+Corners+and+Stay+Cool" title="Share on Hacker News" class="button" rel="nofollow"> <span class="count count-hackernews">0</span> <i class="icon icon-hackernews notranslate" aria-hidden="true"></i> </a> </nav> </header> <article class="main" itemprop="articleBody"><div ><p>You have a task assigned to you, and you don’t like it.

You just want another dish, that’s all.</p><aside class="quote">If you don't know how this damn code works, it's a fault of the code, not you.</aside><p>Once you have those dependencies reported, explain in the main ticket that you can’t continue until all of them are resolved. You will legally stop working, and someone else will improve the code you need. Later, when all dependencies are resolved and the code looks better, try to get back to it again. If you still see issues, create new dependencies. Keep doing this until the code in front of you is clean and easy to fix.</p><p>Don’t be <a href="/2015/12/29/turnover-is-good-for-maintainability.html">a hero</a>—don’t rush into fixing the <a href="/2015/11/24/imprisonment-for-irresponsible-coding.html">bad code</a> you inherited. Think <a href="/2014/10/26/hacker-vs-programmer-mentality.html">like a developer, not a hacker</a>. Remember that your first and most important responsibility as a disciplined engineer is to help the project <em>reveal</em> maintainability issues. Who will fix them and how is the responsibility of a <a href="/2016/05/24/who-is-project-manager.html">project manager</a>. Your job is to reveal, not to hide. By being a hero and trying to fix everything in the scope of a single task, you’re not doing the project a favor—you’re concealing the problem(s).</p><p>Edit: Another good example of a dependency may be a question raised at, for example, <a href="/2017/02/14/stackoverflow-is-your-tool.html">StackOverflow</a> or a user list of a third-party library. If you can’t find a solution yourself and the problem is outside of the scope of your project—submit a question to SO and put its link to the source code (in JavaDoc block, for example).</p><h2 id="demand-better-documentation-and-wait">Demand Better Documentation and Wait</h2><p>All dependencies are resolved and the code looks clean, but you still don’t understand how to fix the problem or implement a new feature. It’s too complex. Or maybe you just don’t know how this library works. Or you’ve never done anything like that before. Anyhow, you can’t continue because you don’t understand. And in order to understand, you will need a lot of time—much more than you have from your project manager or your Scrum board. What do you do?</p><figure class="badge"><img src="https://www.yegor256.com/images/2015/01/cut-corners-2.png" style="width:250px;max-width:100%;" alt="badge" /></figure><p>Again, think positively and don’t blame yourself. If the software is not clear enough for a total stranger, it’s “their” fault, not yours. They created the software in a way that’s difficult to digest and modify. But the code is clean; it’s not spaghetti anymore. It’s a perfectly cooked lobster, but you don’t know how to eat lobster! You’ve never ate it before.</p><p>The chef did a good job; he cooked it well, but the restaurant didn’t give you any instructions on how to eat such a sophisticated dish. What do you do?</p><p>You ask for a manual. You ask for documentation. Properly designed and written source code must be properly documented. Once you see that something is not clear for you, create new dependencies that ask for better documentation of certain aspects of the code.</p><p>Again, don’t be a hero and try to understand everything yourself. Of course you’re a smart guy, but the project doesn’t need a single smart guy. The project needs <a href="/2015/12/29/turnover-is-good-for-maintainability.html">maintainable code</a> that is easy to modify, even by someone who is not as smart as yourself. So do your project a favor: reveal the documentation issue, and ask someone to fix it for you. Not just for you, for everybody. The entire team will benefit from such a request. Once the documentation is fixed, you will continue with your task, and everybody will get source code that is a bit better than it was before. Win-win, isn’t it?</p><h2 id="reproduce-the-bug-and-call-it-a-day">Reproduce the Bug and Call It a Day</h2><p>Now the code is clean, the documentation is good enough, but you’re stuck anyway. What to do? Well, I’m a big fan of test-driven development, so my next suggestion would be to create a test that reproduces the bug. Basically, this is what you should start every ticket with, be it a bug or a feature. Catch the bug with a unit test! Prove that the bug exists by failing the build with a new test.</p><figure class="badge"><a href="http://amzn.to/1SdcZ8M"><img src="https://www.yegor256.com/images/2015/01/working-effectively-with-legacy-code.png" style="width:96px;max-width:100%;" alt="badge" /></a></figure><p>This may be rather difficult to achieve, especially when the software you’re trying to fix or modify was written by <span class="strike">idiots</span> someone who had no idea about unit testing. There are plenty of techniques that may help you find a way to make such software more testable. I would highly recommend you read <a href="http://amzn.to/1SdcZ8M">Working Effectively with Legacy Code</a> by Michael Feathers. There are many different patterns, and most of them work.</p><aside class="quote">Catching a bug with a unit test is, in most cases, more than 80% of success.</aside><p>Once you manage to reproduce the bug and the build fails, stop right there. That’s more than enough for a single piece of work. Skip the test (for example, using <code>@Ignore</code> annotation in JUnit 4) and commit your changes. Then add documentation to the unit test you just created, preferably in the form of a <code>@todo</code>. Explain there that you managed to reproduce the problem but didn’t have enough time to fix it. Or maybe you just don’t know how to fix it. Be honest and give all possible details.</p><p>I believe that catching a bug with a unit test is, in most cases, more than 80% of success. The rest is way more simple: just fix the code and make the test pass. Leave this job to someone else.</p><h2 id="prove-a-bugs-absence">Prove a Bug’s Absence</h2><p>Very often you simply can’t reproduce a bug. That’s not because the code is not testable and can’t be used in a unit test but because you can’t reproduce an error situation. You know that the code crashes in production, but you can’t crash it in a test. The error stack trace reported by the end user or your production logging system is not reproducible. It’s a very common situation. What do you do?</p><figure class="badge"><img src="https://www.yegor256.com/images/2015/01/cut-corners-3.png" style="width:250px;max-width:100%;" alt="badge" /></figure><p>I think the best option here is to create a test that will prove that the code works as intended. The test won’t fail, and the build will remain clean. You will commit it to the repository and … report that the problem is solved. You will say that the reported bug doesn’t really exist in real life. You will state that there is no bug—“our software works correctly; here is the proof: see my new unit test.”</p><p>Will they believe you? I don’t think so, but they don’t have a choice. They can’t push you any further. You’ve already done something—created a new test that proves everything is fine. The ticket will be closed and the project will move on.</p><aside class="youtube"> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBQoTZ-1X-o"><div class="box"> <img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YBQoTZ-1X-o/mqdefault.jpg" alt="YouTube video #YBQoTZ-1X-o" /><div class="play"><i class="icon icon-play"></i></div></div></a><div>How to Cut Corners and Stay Cool (webinar #15); 1 June 2016.</div></aside><p>If, later on, the same problem occurs in production, a new bug will be reported. It will be linked to your ticket. Your experience will help someone investigate the bug further. Maybe that guy will also fail to catch the bug with a test and will also create a new, successful and “useless” test. And this may happen again and again. Eventually, this cumulative group experience will help the last guy catch the bug and fix it.</p><p>Thus, a new passing test is a good response to a bug that you can’t catch with a unit test.</p><h2 id="disable-the-feature">Disable the Feature</h2><p>Sometimes the unit test technique won’t work, mostly because a bug will be too important to be ignored. They won’t agree with you when you show them a unit test that proves the bug doesn’t exist. They will tell you that “when our users are trying to download a PDF, they get a blank page.” And they will also say they don’t really care about your bloody unit tests. All they care about is that PDF document that should be downloadable. So the trick with a unit test won’t work. What do you do?</p><aside class="quote">Production errors are not programmers' mistakes, though delayed tickets are.</aside><p>It depends on many factors, and most of these factors are not technical. They are political, organizational, managerial, social, you name it. However, in most cases, I would recommend you disable that toxic feature, release a new version, and close the ticket.</p><p>You will take the problem off your shoulders and everybody will be pleased. Well, except that poor end user. But this is not your problem. This is the fault of management, which didn’t organize pre-production testing properly. Again, don’t take this blame on yourself. Your job is to keep the code clean and finish your tickets in a reasonable amount of time. Their job is to make sure that developers, testers, DevOps, marketers, product managers, and designers work together to deliver the product with an acceptable number of errors.</p><p>Production errors are not programmers’ mistakes, though delayed tickets are. If you keep a ticket in your hands for too long, you become an unmanageable unit of work. They simply can’t manage you anymore. You’re doing something, trying to fix the bug, saying “I’m trying, I’m trying …” How can they manage such a guy? Instead, you should deliver quickly, even if it comes at the cost of a temporarily disabled feature.</p><h2 id="say-no">Say No</h2><p>OK, let’s say none of the above works. The code is clean, the documentation is acceptable, but you can’t catch the bug, and they don’t accept a unit test from you as proof of the bug’s absence. They also don’t allow you to disable a feature, because it is critical to the user experience. What choices do you have? Just one.</p><figure class="badge"><img src="https://www.yegor256.com/images/2015/01/cut-corners-4.png" style="width:250px;max-width:100%;" alt="badge" /></figure><p>Be professional and say “No, I can’t do this; find someone else.” Being a professional developer doesn’t mean being able to fix any problem. Instead, it means honesty. If you see that you can’t fix the problem, say so as soon as possible. Let them decide what to do. If they eventually decide to fire you because of that, you will remain a professional. They will remember you as a guy who was honest and took his reputation seriously. In the end, you will win.</p><p>Don’t hold the task in your hands. The minute you realize you’re not the best guy for it or you simply can’t fix it—notify your manager. Make it his problem. Actually, it is his problem in the first place. He hired you. He <a href="/2016/03/01/how-we-interview-programmers.html">interviewed</a> you. He decided to give you this task. He estimated your abilities and your skills. So it’s payback time.</p><aside class="quote">Being a professional developer doesn't mean being able to fix any problem.</aside><p>Your “No!” will be very valuable feedback for him. It will help him make his next important management decisions.</p><p>On the other hand, if you lie just to give the impression you’re a guy who can fix anything and yet fail in the end, you will damage not only your reputation but also the project’s performance and objectives.</p></div></article></div><div class="wrapper"> <related-posts /></div><div class="disqus" role="complementary"><p class="disqus_hint"> Please, use <a href="https://help.disqus.com/commenting/what-html-tags-are-allowed-within-comments">syntax highlighting</a> in your comments, to make them more readable.</p><div id="disqus_thread" class="disqus-thread"> <a>&nbsp;</a></div><script> var disqus_config = function () { this.page.url = document.location.href.split('?')[0].split('#')[0].replace('https://', 'http://');
