They will give you cash asking to give them the convertible notes (or SAFE, which is very similar). Convertible notes are just a few pages of paper with two signatures at the bottom. Not too much to worry about. It’s basically a contract between your startup and an investor. Let’s see what exactly it says and what you, as a founder, should pay attention to.</p><figure class="jb_picture"><img itemprop="image" alt="The Godfather: Part III (1990) by Francis Ford Coppola" src="/images/2016/05/the-godfather-iii.jpg" longdesc="#39121fa4" /><figcaption id="39121fa4">The Godfather: Part III (1990) by Francis Ford Coppola</figcaption></figure><h2 id="why-not-equity">Why Not Equity?</h2><p>The first question is why convertible notes? Why not just shares of stock? And what the hell are “shares of stock” in the first place, right? Basically, there are two questions in each business or in any group activity, be it a new mobile app, a multi-national corporation or a bank robbery: 1) who is the boss, and 2) who gets the profit. To regulate that process “shares of stock” were invented (if you know who invented them and when, let me know).</p><p>Say we’re planning to <del>rob a bank</del> create a Facebook killer. There are three of us. We print three papers, each of which says: “whoever holds this paper has one vote and will get an equal part of the profit.” How does that sound? Each of us has the same paper. When it’s time to decide whether we use Java or PHP, we sit together, show our papers and vote. One vote for Java, two for PHP—the decision is made, we will use PHP. When our startup finally dies and it’s time to decide what to do with the domain name, we sell it for $300 and give $100 to each holder of that paper, since there are just three papers and they have equal rights.</p><p>Thus, basically, each share of stock (this is an official name of that piece of paper) is a <strong>promise</strong>. A promise of some rights to vote and to make profit. The company (our startup) is making us a promise.</p><p>By the way, I can sell my share of stock to my friend. When it’s time to decide whether it’s Java or PHP, he will show up and vote. You may not like that, since you are seeing this dude for the first time, but you will have to obey—he’s got that paper in his hands. That’s why shares of stock are also called <strong>equity</strong>. I can sell them just like I can sell my car. No matter who owns them, he or she has exactly the same rights as the original or the previous owner. They are assets.</p><p>Usually, there are millions or billions of shares of stock. When a company starts, it prints, say, a million of them, giving 200,000 to each co-founder and leaving 400,000 in the so-called “pool.” Later, an investor shows up and says: “I will put $500,000 to the bank account of the company and the company will print 300,000 more shares of stock for me.” The amount of shares “issued” is growing. For example, at the time of writing there are <a href="https://www.google.com/finance?cid=358464">7.91 billion</a> shares with Microsoft name of them. Microsoft Corporation has been printing extra shares <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/Investor/FAQ.aspx">nine times</a> after their IPO in 1986. When Bill Gates founded the company in April 1975, he had 500K shares, which were equal to 50% (I’m guessing, do you know exact numbers?). Now he holds <a href="http://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/122215/top-4-microsoft-shareholders.asp">nearly 223M</a>, which is just 2.8% of the total.</p><p>Now, the most annoying part. In reality, shares are not just pieces of paper with a few sentences on them, like in our example above. They are big legal documents that explain exactly how their holder can vote and exactly when and how he or she will get the profit. There are tons of legal clauses, which usually take weeks or months of discussions, between the company and investors. In reality, an investor says: “I will put $500,000 to the bank account of the company and the company will print 300,000 more shares of stock for me, <em>terms and conditions of which my lawyer will discuss with you</em>.”</p><p>If we’re talking about $500K, you will have no problem meeting that lawyers. However, if it’s just $25K… To make life easier for smaller investments, convertible notes were invented (well, there were <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/04/07/convertible-note-seed-financings/">a few other reasons</a>). They are <strong>not equity</strong>. Investors that have convertible notes can’t vote. They can’t sell convertible notes and they can’t get any profit from the company. So, what they are for then? I’ll explain in a minute. My goal so far was to show why young companies don’t want to deal with shares of stock—because of greedy lawyers and, of course, the complexity of terms and conditions.</p><h2 id="what-are-convertible-notes">What are Convertible Notes?</h2><p>They are just debts. They are not real investments. The company simply borrows money from an investor, promising to return them back. Why not just call them “money borrowing notes?” Because investors don’t want their money back. They want equity.</p><p>So here is how it works. Say I’m an investor, giving you $25K. You give me convertible notes. Then we wait. We wait until a more serious investor shows up and gives you a bigger sum of money. And it’s not just a matter of amount. What’s important is that this investor must get shares of stock from you. This will be called “equity financing.” You get finance and give away equity. When this happens, I show up, give you the convertible notes and you give me equity. On the same terms as you gave to that investor. I won’t send you my lawyers, you won’t discuss terms and conditions. You will just <strong>convert</strong> my notes to equity, on the same terms as agreed with that investor. Plain and simple.</p><p>A practical example. There is you and your co-founder. You guys have 1,000,000 shares of stock, 500K issued to each of you. I give you $25K, you give me convertible notes. In a few months, an investor comes in and your company issues 100,000 shares and sells them for $400,000 (your post a $400K check to the bank account of your company). This means that now there are 1,100,000 shares in total. You just sold 100K of them with the price of $4 per share. Now it’s time to convert my convertible notes. You will have to give me 6,250 shares and I’ll return you the notes. Thus, in the end, there will be 1,106,250 shares total and your company’s post-money valuation will be $4,425,000. Got the math?</p><p>My shares will have exactly the same “rights, privileges, preferences and restrictions” as the shares you gave to the investor. And I won’t have an option to negotiate. I will just receive them and accept.</p><p>One more thing. If that investor will never show up, you still owe me $25K. A debt is a debt.</p><p>Now, since we know what convertible notes are for and how they work, let’s see what is important to pay attention to. There are just a few things, but they are really important.</p><h2 id="the-valuation-cap">The Valuation Cap</h2><p>Let’s take a look again at the example above. You are selling 100,000 shares for $4. This technically means that the shares the two of you had, before the investor showed up, suddenly got some value, right? They were just papers, but now someone is ready to pay $4 for each of them.</p><p>This means that each of you, being a holder of 500K shares, owns equity for $2,000,000 (I’m just multiplying 500K by $4). Also, this means that the valuation of the company is $4M. I’m just multiplying the total amount of shares, which is a million, by the price of each share. This valuation is also called <strong>pre-money valuation</strong> (the valuation before that $400K landed at your bank account).</p><p>There is also a post-money valuation, which, as you can imagine, is calculated by multiplying total amount of shares after the investment, by their price. In this case, it’s $4.4M (1,100,000 by $4).</p><p>Let’s see what happened in our example with my $25K. I gave them to you when your company was very young. Your valuation was rather low, because you barely had any results. You needed small cash to pay your bills and fill your car with gas. The valuation was definitely lower than $4M. So why are you converting my notes as if at the time of my investment the valuation was already that high. It’s not fair. I want to get more than 6,250 shares. I want my part to be calculated as if your valuation was, say, $500K. In that case, I will get 20,000 shares. That’s fair. The investor will pay $400K to get 100K shares, but I paid just $25K to get 20K of them. I earned more equity, because my risk was way higher.</p><p>To make that math happen, we put a “valuation cap” into the convertible notes. There will be a clause that guarantees that no matter what will be that pre-money valuation at the moment of “equity financing,” in my formula it will stay $500K.</p><p>Obviously, for you as a founder, an ideal situation would be to have “no cap” convertible notes. That’s the first thing you should try to insist on: no cap! Most investors will smile back and disagree. It’s only logical. Then, try to negotiate the value of the cap. Try to make it as big as possible.</p><p>But remember, it’s better to have money and a small cap than a big cap and no money. Does it sound too obvious?</p><h2 id="the-discount">The Discount</h2><p>Here is the same problem, but a different instrument. Again, as an investor, I don’t like that you’re selling me shares for $4. This is the price you are giving to the investor who came way later than myself. Their risks are way lower. I want a discount!</p><p>We can put a clause into convertible notes, which will say that the price for me will be same as for the investor at the moment of “equity financing,” minus, say, a 50% <strong>discount</strong>.</p><p>Again, as a founder, you should insist on “no discount” convertible notes. Will I agree? Probably not. Especially if there is no cap. Try to negotiate a smaller discount. Maybe 10%, just to give me a feeling of appreciation.</p><h2 id="the-interest">The Interest</h2><p>Remember that by signing convertible notes and sending you cash, investors are basically <strong>lending</strong> you money. You owe that $25K to them. And some of them will ask for an interest. And the interest may be payable annually. Say, 5% per year. That means that you will have to send them a check for $1,250 every year, no matter how your startup is doing.</p><p>It’s only logical for them, but is totally against you. Do not agree to pay any interest.</p><h2 id="the-maturity-date">The Maturity Date</h2><p>Some investors are ready to wait until that “equity financing” moment for as much as necessary. Others may demand you to pay them back on a so called “maturity date.” Pay cash, with the interest. This date will usually be somewhere far ahead, like “three years from now.” But don’t feel too relaxed, this day will come faster than you expect.</p><p>Try not to give convertible notes with a maturity date to anyone.</p><p><a href="https://blog.ycombinator.com/announcing-the-safe-a-replacement-for-convertible-notes">SAFE</a> is a form of convertible notes, introduced by <a href="http://www.ycombinator.com">YC</a>, which doesn’t have a maturity date at all.

Most likely there will be nothing, so don’t worry.</p><hr /><p>There are other less usual or less important elements of convertible notes, which you most likely won’t ever see or should not worry about, like pro-data rights, for example.

Not too much to worry about. It’s basically a contract between your startup and an investor. Let’s see what exactly it says and what you, as a founder, should pay attention to.</p><figure class="jb_picture"><img itemprop="image" alt="The Godfather: Part III (1990) by Francis Ford Coppola" src="/images/2016/05/the-godfather-iii.jpg" longdesc="#39121fa4" /><figcaption id="39121fa4">The Godfather: Part III (1990) by Francis Ford Coppola</figcaption></figure><h2 id="why-not-equity">Why Not Equity?</h2><p>The first question is why convertible notes? Why not just shares of stock? And what the hell are “shares of stock” in the first place, right? Basically, there are two questions in each business or in any group activity, be it a new mobile app, a multi-national corporation or a bank robbery: 1) who is the boss, and 2) who gets the profit. To regulate that process “shares of stock” were invented (if you know who invented them and when, let me know).</p><p>Say we’re planning to <del>rob a bank</del> create a Facebook killer. There are three of us. We print three papers, each of which says: “whoever holds this paper has one vote and will get an equal part of the profit.” How does that sound? Each of us has the same paper. When it’s time to decide whether we use Java or PHP, we sit together, show our papers and vote. One vote for Java, two for PHP—the decision is made, we will use PHP. When our startup finally dies and it’s time to decide what to do with the domain name, we sell it for $300 and give $100 to each holder of that paper, since there are just three papers and they have equal rights.</p><p>Thus, basically, each share of stock (this is an official name of that piece of paper) is a <strong>promise</strong>. A promise of some rights to vote and to make profit. The company (our startup) is making us a promise.</p><p>By the way, I can sell my share of stock to my friend. When it’s time to decide whether it’s Java or PHP, he will show up and vote. You may not like that, since you are seeing this dude for the first time, but you will have to obey—he’s got that paper in his hands. That’s why shares of stock are also called <strong>equity</strong>. I can sell them just like I can sell my car. No matter who owns them, he or she has exactly the same rights as the original or the previous owner. They are assets.</p><p>Usually, there are millions or billions of shares of stock. When a company starts, it prints, say, a million of them, giving 200,000 to each co-founder and leaving 400,000 in the so-called “pool.” Later, an investor shows up and says: “I will put $500,000 to the bank account of the company and the company will print 300,000 more shares of stock for me.” The amount of shares “issued” is growing. For example, at the time of writing there are <a href="https://www.google.com/finance?cid=358464">7.91 billion</a> shares with Microsoft name of them. Microsoft Corporation has been printing extra shares <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/Investor/FAQ.aspx">nine times</a> after their IPO in 1986. When Bill Gates founded the company in April 1975, he had 500K shares, which were equal to 50% (I’m guessing, do you know exact numbers?). Now he holds <a href="http://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/122215/top-4-microsoft-shareholders.asp">nearly 223M</a>, which is just 2.8% of the total.</p><p>Now, the most annoying part. In reality, shares are not just pieces of paper with a few sentences on them, like in our example above. They are big legal documents that explain exactly how their holder can vote and exactly when and how he or she will get the profit. There are tons of legal clauses, which usually take weeks or months of discussions, between the company and investors. In reality, an investor says: “I will put $500,000 to the bank account of the company and the company will print 300,000 more shares of stock for me, <em>terms and conditions of which my lawyer will discuss with you</em>.”</p><p>If we’re talking about $500K, you will have no problem meeting that lawyers. However, if it’s just $25K… To make life easier for smaller investments, convertible notes were invented (well, there were <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/04/07/convertible-note-seed-financings/">a few other reasons</a>). They are <strong>not equity</strong>. Investors that have convertible notes can’t vote. They can’t sell convertible notes and they can’t get any profit from the company. So, what they are for then? I’ll explain in a minute. My goal so far was to show why young companies don’t want to deal with shares of stock—because of greedy lawyers and, of course, the complexity of terms and conditions.</p><h2 id="what-are-convertible-notes">What are Convertible Notes?</h2><p>They are just debts. They are not real investments. The company simply borrows money from an investor, promising to return them back. Why not just call them “money borrowing notes?” Because investors don’t want their money back. They want equity.</p><p>So here is how it works. Say I’m an investor, giving you $25K. You give me convertible notes. Then we wait. We wait until a more serious investor shows up and gives you a bigger sum of money. And it’s not just a matter of amount. What’s important is that this investor must get shares of stock from you. This will be called “equity financing.” You get finance and give away equity. When this happens, I show up, give you the convertible notes and you give me equity. On the same terms as you gave to that investor. I won’t send you my lawyers, you won’t discuss terms and conditions. You will just <strong>convert</strong> my notes to equity, on the same terms as agreed with that investor. Plain and simple.</p><p>A practical example. There is you and your co-founder. You guys have 1,000,000 shares of stock, 500K issued to each of you. I give you $25K, you give me convertible notes. In a few months, an investor comes in and your company issues 100,000 shares and sells them for $400,000 (your post a $400K check to the bank account of your company). This means that now there are 1,100,000 shares in total. You just sold 100K of them with the price of $4 per share. Now it’s time to convert my convertible notes. You will have to give me 6,250 shares and I’ll return you the notes. Thus, in the end, there will be 1,106,250 shares total and your company’s post-money valuation will be $4,425,000. Got the math?</p><p>My shares will have exactly the same “rights, privileges, preferences and restrictions” as the shares you gave to the investor. And I won’t have an option to negotiate. I will just receive them and accept.</p><p>One more thing. If that investor will never show up, you still owe me $25K. A debt is a debt.</p><p>Now, since we know what convertible notes are for and how they work, let’s see what is important to pay attention to. There are just a few things, but they are really important.</p><h2 id="the-valuation-cap">The Valuation Cap</h2><p>Let’s take a look again at the example above. You are selling 100,000 shares for $4. This technically means that the shares the two of you had, before the investor showed up, suddenly got some value, right? They were just papers, but now someone is ready to pay $4 for each of them.</p><p>This means that each of you, being a holder of 500K shares, owns equity for $2,000,000 (I’m just multiplying 500K by $4). Also, this means that the valuation of the company is $4M. I’m just multiplying the total amount of shares, which is a million, by the price of each share. This valuation is also called <strong>pre-money valuation</strong> (the valuation before that $400K landed at your bank account).</p><p>There is also a post-money valuation, which, as you can imagine, is calculated by multiplying total amount of shares after the investment, by their price. In this case, it’s $4.4M (1,100,000 by $4).</p><p>Let’s see what happened in our example with my $25K. I gave them to you when your company was very young. Your valuation was rather low, because you barely had any results. You needed small cash to pay your bills and fill your car with gas. The valuation was definitely lower than $4M. So why are you converting my notes as if at the time of my investment the valuation was already that high. It’s not fair. I want to get more than 6,250 shares. I want my part to be calculated as if your valuation was, say, $500K. In that case, I will get 20,000 shares. That’s fair. The investor will pay $400K to get 100K shares, but I paid just $25K to get 20K of them. I earned more equity, because my risk was way higher.</p><p>To make that math happen, we put a “valuation cap” into the convertible notes.

A promise of some rights to vote and to make profit. The company (our startup) is making us a promise.</p><p>By the way, I can sell my share of stock to my friend. When it’s time to decide whether it’s Java or PHP, he will show up and vote. You may not like that, since you are seeing this dude for the first time, but you will have to obey—he’s got that paper in his hands. That’s why shares of stock are also called <strong>equity</strong>. I can sell them just like I can sell my car. No matter who owns them, he or she has exactly the same rights as the original or the previous owner. They are assets.</p><p>Usually, there are millions or billions of shares of stock. When a company starts, it prints, say, a million of them, giving 200,000 to each co-founder and leaving 400,000 in the so-called “pool.” Later, an investor shows up and says: “I will put $500,000 to the bank account of the company and the company will print 300,000 more shares of stock for me.” The amount of shares “issued” is growing. For example, at the time of writing there are <a href="https://www.google.com/finance?cid=358464">7.91 billion</a> shares with Microsoft name of them. Microsoft Corporation has been printing extra shares <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/Investor/FAQ.aspx">nine times</a> after their IPO in 1986. When Bill Gates founded the company in April 1975, he had 500K shares, which were equal to 50% (I’m guessing, do you know exact numbers?). Now he holds <a href="http://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/122215/top-4-microsoft-shareholders.asp">nearly 223M</a>, which is just 2.8% of the total.</p><p>Now, the most annoying part. In reality, shares are not just pieces of paper with a few sentences on them, like in our example above. They are big legal documents that explain exactly how their holder can vote and exactly when and how he or she will get the profit. There are tons of legal clauses, which usually take weeks or months of discussions, between the company and investors. In reality, an investor says: “I will put $500,000 to the bank account of the company and the company will print 300,000 more shares of stock for me, <em>terms and conditions of which my lawyer will discuss with you</em>.”</p><p>If we’re talking about $500K, you will have no problem meeting that lawyers. However, if it’s just $25K… To make life easier for smaller investments, convertible notes were invented (well, there were <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/04/07/convertible-note-seed-financings/">a few other reasons</a>). They are <strong>not equity</strong>. Investors that have convertible notes can’t vote. They can’t sell convertible notes and they can’t get any profit from the company. So, what they are for then? I’ll explain in a minute. My goal so far was to show why young companies don’t want to deal with shares of stock—because of greedy lawyers and, of course, the complexity of terms and conditions.</p><h2 id="what-are-convertible-notes">What are Convertible Notes?</h2><p>They are just debts. They are not real investments. The company simply borrows money from an investor, promising to return them back. Why not just call them “money borrowing notes?” Because investors don’t want their money back. They want equity.</p><p>So here is how it works. Say I’m an investor, giving you $25K. You give me convertible notes. Then we wait. We wait until a more serious investor shows up and gives you a bigger sum of money. And it’s not just a matter of amount. What’s important is that this investor must get shares of stock from you. This will be called “equity financing.” You get finance and give away equity. When this happens, I show up, give you the convertible notes and you give me equity. On the same terms as you gave to that investor. I won’t send you my lawyers, you won’t discuss terms and conditions. You will just <strong>convert</strong> my notes to equity, on the same terms as agreed with that investor. Plain and simple.</p><p>A practical example. There is you and your co-founder. You guys have 1,000,000 shares of stock, 500K issued to each of you. I give you $25K, you give me convertible notes. In a few months, an investor comes in and your company issues 100,000 shares and sells them for $400,000 (your post a $400K check to the bank account of your company). This means that now there are 1,100,000 shares in total. You just sold 100K of them with the price of $4 per share. Now it’s time to convert my convertible notes. You will have to give me 6,250 shares and I’ll return you the notes. Thus, in the end, there will be 1,106,250 shares total and your company’s post-money valuation will be $4,425,000. Got the math?</p><p>My shares will have exactly the same “rights, privileges, preferences and restrictions” as the shares you gave to the investor. And I won’t have an option to negotiate. I will just receive them and accept.</p><p>One more thing. If that investor will never show up, you still owe me $25K. A debt is a debt.</p><p>Now, since we know what convertible notes are for and how they work, let’s see what is important to pay attention to. There are just a few things, but they are really important.</p><h2 id="the-valuation-cap">The Valuation Cap</h2><p>Let’s take a look again at the example above. You are selling 100,000 shares for $4. This technically means that the shares the two of you had, before the investor showed up, suddenly got some value, right? They were just papers, but now someone is ready to pay $4 for each of them.</p><p>This means that each of you, being a holder of 500K shares, owns equity for $2,000,000 (I’m just multiplying 500K by $4). Also, this means that the valuation of the company is $4M. I’m just multiplying the total amount of shares, which is a million, by the price of each share. This valuation is also called <strong>pre-money valuation</strong> (the valuation before that $400K landed at your bank account).</p><p>There is also a post-money valuation, which, as you can imagine, is calculated by multiplying total amount of shares after the investment, by their price. In this case, it’s $4.4M (1,100,000 by $4).</p><p>Let’s see what happened in our example with my $25K. I gave them to you when your company was very young. Your valuation was rather low, because you barely had any results. You needed small cash to pay your bills and fill your car with gas. The valuation was definitely lower than $4M. So why are you converting my notes as if at the time of my investment the valuation was already that high. It’s not fair. I want to get more than 6,250 shares. I want my part to be calculated as if your valuation was, say, $500K. In that case, I will get 20,000 shares. That’s fair. The investor will pay $400K to get 100K shares, but I paid just $25K to get 20K of them. I earned more equity, because my risk was way higher.</p><p>To make that math happen, we put a “valuation cap” into the convertible notes. There will be a clause that guarantees that no matter what will be that pre-money valuation at the moment of “equity financing,” in my formula it will stay $500K.</p><p>Obviously, for you as a founder, an ideal situation would be to have “no cap” convertible notes. That’s the first thing you should try to insist on: no cap! Most investors will smile back and disagree. It’s only logical. Then, try to negotiate the value of the cap. Try to make it as big as possible.</p><p>But remember, it’s better to have money and a small cap than a big cap and no money. Does it sound too obvious?</p><h2 id="the-discount">The Discount</h2><p>Here is the same problem, but a different instrument. Again, as an investor, I don’t like that you’re selling me shares for $4. This is the price you are giving to the investor who came way later than myself. Their risks are way lower. I want a discount!</p><p>We can put a clause into convertible notes, which will say that the price for me will be same as for the investor at the moment of “equity financing,” minus, say, a 50% <strong>discount</strong>.</p><p>Again, as a founder, you should insist on “no discount” convertible notes. Will I agree? Probably not. Especially if there is no cap. Try to negotiate a smaller discount. Maybe 10%, just to give me a feeling of appreciation.</p><h2 id="the-interest">The Interest</h2><p>Remember that by signing convertible notes and sending you cash, investors are basically <strong>lending</strong> you money. You owe that $25K to them. And some of them will ask for an interest. And the interest may be payable annually. Say, 5% per year. That means that you will have to send them a check for $1,250 every year, no matter how your startup is doing.</p><p>It’s only logical for them, but is totally against you. Do not agree to pay any interest.</p><h2 id="the-maturity-date">The Maturity Date</h2><p>Some investors are ready to wait until that “equity financing” moment for as much as necessary. Others may demand you to pay them back on a so called “maturity date.” Pay cash, with the interest. This date will usually be somewhere far ahead, like “three years from now.” But don’t feel too relaxed, this day will come faster than you expect.</p><p>Try not to give convertible notes with a maturity date to anyone.</p><p><a href="https://blog.ycombinator.com/announcing-the-safe-a-replacement-for-convertible-notes">SAFE</a> is a form of convertible notes, introduced by <a href="http://www.ycombinator.com">YC</a>, which doesn’t have a maturity date at all. This technically means that you don’t have to pay them anything back. Well, there is only one situation when you have to pay—in case your startup dies. In that case, you will have to pay investors as much as you can, using the cash you still have in your bank account. Most likely there will be nothing, so don’t worry.</p><hr /><p>There are other less usual or less important elements of convertible notes, which you most likely won’t ever see or should not worry about, like pro-data rights, for example. Just focus on the things listed above and you will be good.</p></p><nav class="buttons notranslate desktop-only"> <a href="http://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://www.yegor256.com/2016/05/17/convertible-notes.html" title="Share on Facebook" class="button" rel="nofollow"> <span class="count count-facebook">0</span> <i class="icon icon-facebook notranslate" aria-hidden="true"></i> </a> <a href="https://twitter.com/share?url=https://www.yegor256.com/2016/05/17/convertible-notes.html&amp;text=What+to+Worry+About+in+Convertible+Notes" title="Share on Twitter" class="button" rel="nofollow"> <span class="count count-twitter">0</span> <i class="icon icon-twitter notranslate" aria-hidden="true"></i> </a> <a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=https://www.yegor256.com/2016/05/17/convertible-notes.html" title="Share on Google+" class="button" rel="nofollow"> <span class="count count-googleplus">0</span> <i class="icon icon-googleplus notranslate" aria-hidden="true"></i> </a> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/cws/share?url=https://www.yegor256.com/2016/05/17/convertible-notes.html" title="Share on LinkedIn" class="button" rel="nofollow"> <span class="count count-linkedin">0</span> <i class="icon icon-linkedin notranslate" aria-hidden="true"></i> </a> <a href="http://reddit.com/submit?url=https://www.yegor256.com/2016/05/17/convertible-notes.html%3F2016-20&amp;title=What+to+Worry+About+in+Convertible+Notes" title="Share on Reddit" class="button" rel="nofollow"> <span class="count count-reddit">0</span> <i class="icon icon-reddit notranslate" aria-hidden="true"></i> </a> <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/submitlink?u=https://www.yegor256.com/2016/05/17/convertible-notes.html%3F2016-20&amp;t=What+to+Worry+About+in+Convertible+Notes" title="Share on Hacker News" class="button" rel="nofollow"> <span class="count count-hackernews">0</span> <i class="icon icon-hackernews notranslate" aria-hidden="true"></i> </a> </nav> </header> <article class="main" itemprop="articleBody"><div ><p>“<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convertible_bond">Convertible Notes</a>” is what you most likely will hear the first time you get money for your first startup. They will give you cash asking to give them the convertible notes (or SAFE, which is very similar). Convertible notes are just a few pages of paper with two signatures at the bottom. Not too much to worry about. It’s basically a contract between your startup and an investor. Let’s see what exactly it says and what you, as a founder, should pay attention to.</p><figure class="jb_picture"><img itemprop="image" alt="The Godfather: Part III (1990) by Francis Ford Coppola" src="/images/2016/05/the-godfather-iii.jpg" longdesc="#39121fa4" /><figcaption id="39121fa4">The Godfather: Part III (1990) by Francis Ford Coppola</figcaption></figure><h2 id="why-not-equity">Why Not Equity?</h2><p>The first question is why convertible notes? Why not just shares of stock? And what the hell are “shares of stock” in the first place, right? Basically, there are two questions in each business or in any group activity, be it a new mobile app, a multi-national corporation or a bank robbery: 1) who is the boss, and 2) who gets the profit. To regulate that process “shares of stock” were invented (if you know who invented them and when, let me know).</p><p>Say we’re planning to <del>rob a bank</del> create a Facebook killer. There are three of us. We print three papers, each of which says: “whoever holds this paper has one vote and will get an equal part of the profit.” How does that sound? Each of us has the same paper. When it’s time to decide whether we use Java or PHP, we sit together, show our papers and vote. One vote for Java, two for PHP—the decision is made, we will use PHP. When our startup finally dies and it’s time to decide what to do with the domain name, we sell it for $300 and give $100 to each holder of that paper, since there are just three papers and they have equal rights.</p><p>Thus, basically, each share of stock (this is an official name of that piece of paper) is a <strong>promise</strong>.

Because your main source of income is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profit_%28accounting%29">profit</a> you will get from the business, in the form of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dividend">dividends</a>.</p><p>How rich you will become depends on many factors, but usually such a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifestyle_business">lifestyle business</a> takes years to really take off and start making millions of dollars, which you’re obviously looking for.</p><p>In that type of business, almost everything depends on your energy, your management skills, and your ability to work non-stop and motivate others to do the same. If you have all that in place, you most certainly will get what you deserve sooner or later. In most cases, later. But you will get it.</p><p>The concept of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startup_company">startup company</a> is completely different. A startup is a <strong>wild bet</strong> you’re making on some crazy idea that makes “the world a better place.” You’re building a new Facebook, a Google killer, or a Snapchat replacement. Your goal is huge, while the investment is very small. Just a few years of work and you’ll score hundreds of millions. This money will come not from happy customers and steadily growing revenue. Not at all. You will become filthy rich only when someone buys your startup.</p><p>These two strategies contradict each other: a traditional business vs. a startup.</p><p>Customers and revenue are not the goal of a startup, but rather an <strong>instrument</strong> that helps you achieve the real goal: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_valuation">valuation</a>. You are supposed to use your revenue to convince investors that the prototype works and your valuation is already high enough. Your steadily growing cash flow right now must be used as a demonstration of a future <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_acquisition_management">customer acquisition</a> model. But it is not the result by itself. It is just a tool in your hands.</p><p>Your valuation is what makes you rich, <strong>not</strong> your revenue or your happy customers. Of course, the revenue is important, but only as long as it serves the main goal—increase valuation at an extremely fast pace. The revenue is not the goal; it’s the way to achieve it. The valuation is the goal.</p><p>Startup valuation must grow fast, ideally doubling itself every few months. If that’s not happening, close the business and start something else. The valuation must <strong>skyrocket</strong> or you have to abandon the startup and try your hand on another one as soon as possible.</p><aside class="quote">The revenue is good for you but not really good for investors</aside><p>One of the biggest mistakes a startup founder can make is to forget about this “skyrocketing valuation” principle and focus on making customers happy and grow revenue. You will most likely kill your startup and maybe turn it into a lifestyle business.</p><p>Savvy investors will avoid you, mostly because they understand that growing revenue is just one of many other <strong>elements</strong> of a growing valuation. If you’re focused on just one element, you most likely won’t multiply your valuation a hundred times over the next year. Maybe you will multiply revenue a few times, but who cares? The revenue is good for you but not really good for investors.</p><p>What is good for investors? What do they want to see you doing to convince them that you’re working hard on making the valuation grow? I’ll try to cover that in one of the next articles.</p></div></article></div><div class="wrapper"> <related-posts /></div><div class="disqus" role="complementary"><p class="disqus_hint"> Please, use <a href="https://help.disqus.com/commenting/what-html-tags-are-allowed-within-comments">syntax highlighting</a> in your comments, to make them more readable.</p><div id="disqus_thread" class="disqus-thread"> <a>&nbsp;</a></div><script> var disqus_config = function () { this.page.url = document.location.href.split('?')[0].split('#')[0].replace('https://', 'http://'); this.page.identifier = this.page.url; }; (function() { var d = document, s = d.createElement('script'); s.src = '//yegor256.disqus.com/embed.js'; s.setAttribute('data-timestamp', +new Date()); (d.head || d.body).appendChild(s); })(); </script> <noscript><div><p class="red"> JavaScript is disabled in your browser, that's why you can't see comments under this post.</p></div></noscript></div><div class="wrapper"> <footer class="footer"><p> &copy; <span itemscope="" itemprop="copyrightHolder" itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"> <span itemprop="name">Yegor Bugayenko</span> </span> 2014&ndash;<span itemprop="copyrightYear">2018</span></p></footer></div></section><div class="wrapper unprintable" style="text-align:center;margin-top:2em;"> <a href="http://www.sixnines.io/h/3ba1652f"> <img src="//www.sixnines.io/b/3ba1652f?style=flat" alt="sixnines availability badge"/> </a></div><script src="//code.jquery.com/jquery-1.9.0.min.js"></script> <script src="/js/all.js?1fb6c19ef56"></script> <script>var disqus_shortname = 'yegor256';</script> <script id="dsq-count-scr" src="//yegor256.disqus.com/count.js" async="async"></script> <script> (function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){ (i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o), m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m) })(window,document,'script','//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga'); ga('create', 'UA-1963507-32', 'auto'); ga('send', 'pageview'); </script> <script> Cd=document;Cr="&"+Math.random();Cp="&s=1"; Cd.cookie="b=b";if(Cd.cookie)Cp+="&c=1"; Cp+="&t="+(new Date()).getTimezoneOffset(); if(self!=top)Cp+="&f=1"; </script> <script> if(navigator.javaEnabled())Cp+="&j=1"; </script> <script> if(typeof(screen)!='undefined')Cp+="&w="+screen.width+"&h="+ screen.height+"&d="+(screen.colorDepth?screen.colorDepth:screen.pixelDepth); </script> <script> Cd.write("<img src='//c.hit.ua/hit?i=95870&g=0&x=2"+Cp+Cr+ "&r="+escape(Cd.referrer)+"&u="+escape(window.location.href)+ "' border='0' wi"+"dth='1' he"+"ight='1'/>"); </script> <script type="application/ld+json"> { "@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Person", "name": "Yegor Bugayenko", "url": "https://www.yegor256.com", "sameAs": [ "https://www.facebook.com/yegor256", "https://instagram.com/yegor256", "https://www.linkedin.com/in/yegor256", "https://twitter.com/yegor256", "https://github.com/yegor256", "https://www.pinterest.com/yegor256/" ] } </script> </body> </html> <!DOCTYPE html> <html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/WebSite"> <head> <meta charset="utf-8"/> <meta name="description" content="<p>Your success depends on the quality of your <strong>elevator pitch</strong>. Basically, your success doesn’t depend on much of anything else. The pitch is king. You have to impress the <del>catcher</del> investor in just a few seconds while the elevator is still moving (that’s where you are supposed to hunt for that prey). It’s not rocket science; you can learn a few basic principles and become a expert. Here they are, the principles.</p><figure class="jb_picture"><img itemprop="image" alt="Huevos de oro (1993) by Bigas Luna" src="/images/2016/03/huevos-de-oro.jpg" longdesc="#06c2164b" /><figcaption id="06c2164b">Huevos de oro (1993) by Bigas Luna</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Look</strong>. Rule number 1: You must look right, like Mark Zuckerberg—the same gray T-shirt every day with the same smile. The way you look must demonstrate that you’re part of the community. You’re one of us! These three things will help: a beard, an electric skateboard, and an Apple Watch. If you’re a girl, replace the beard with a yoga mat and you’re all set. By looking that way, you’re telling investors that your chances to succeed are way higher than anyone who doesn’t have an Apple Watch and is a stranger because of that.</p><aside class="quote">Anyone who doesn't have an Apple Watch is a stranger</aside><p><strong>Innovate</strong>. These are the words you must include in your pitch: innovation, innovative, innovate. It’s never too many. Put them (or their synonyms) everywhere; it’s all for good. How about this: “Our innovative solution is an environmental breakthrough?” Nobody knows what it means, but everybody understands that you’re a big-time innovator. Even if it’s yet another calorie calculator. Investors must understand that you’re not just making a software product; you <em>innovate</em>.</p><p><strong>Complicate</strong>. Internet of Things in lieu of a thermometer, augmented reality instead of goggles with a camera, and global health rather than a database of dentists. You get the idea. Don’t be specific; it’s dangerous. They may ask you what kind of database it is and how it’s different than the other 50 databases on the market. But if you say global health, they won’t have any idea what you’re talking about, which is exactly what you need. Learn those words and use them whenever possible. Here are some of my favorites for you to remember: business model canvas, viral mechanics, growth hacking, data-driven mentality, design thinking, and game-changing disruption.</p><aside class="quote">But be careful, don't overact or you may end up in a mental hospital</aside><p><strong>Smile</strong>. You are super excited about this fantastic opportunity! You’re extremely motivated to do this project with these absolutely great people! You’re passionate about the idea and fully committed to implementing it! You love the team, the partners, the investors, and the customers—they’re all very nice people you’re happy to work with! You’re very enthusiastic about everything! You love everyone! … But be careful; don’t overact or you may end up in a mental hospital.</p><p><strong>Compare</strong>. Compare yourself to Uber; you will never lose. It was Airbnb a few years ago and Dropbox before that. Today it’s Uber. Start your pitch with “It’s like Uber but …” No matter what you put after that, it will work. All investors are dreaming about getting a new Uber in their portfolio. You should help them make this dream come true. There’s no need to be too complicated; just say you’re “like Uber but …” and your chances to score Round A will jump higher.</p><p><strong>Imitate</strong>. Elon Musk! You have to mention this guy; you absolutely must. Try this: “As Elon Musk said in his book, it is very difficult to build a successful startup.” You, being aware of wisdom like that, give them the impression that you’re related to the Silicon Valley culture, which is what they want to feel. Always try to show that Elon Musk is a role model for you. Having a T-shirt featuring his face will also help. By the way, don’t use Steve Jobs; it’s not a trend anymore. Moreover, he is dead already. Stick to Musk.</p><aside class="quote">Never compete with them or even try to argue, investors are always right</aside><p><strong>Respect</strong>. Always remember that you and your potential investors are not equal. They have money, experience, reputation, and a Tesla. You have nothing. You must demonstrate that you always remember that. Always position yourself a bit lower, play newbie, ask questions, and imitate interest in everything they say. Never compete with them or even try to argue! They are always right, and they are simply awesome; you’re just another nobody. Something like “I’m honored to be in the same room with you” is a very good opener.</p><p><strong>Co-Found</strong>. You absolutely must have a co-founder, or even a few of them. They could be anybody. A roommate will work or just a friend of a friend who recently quit her full-time job. It doesn’t matter who they are as long as you can call them co-founders. Put their pictures and names on your website and always say “we” instead of “I.” Investors, in general, love to have a few phone numbers they can call when they realize their money is gone and there is nothing left. Also, it’s more fun to invest into a group of people—investors look more serious in that case.</p><aside class="quote">Never admit any mistakes or risks, simply ignore them, stay positive</aside><p><strong>Radiate</strong>. Never say anything bad about anything or anyone. You literally have to be 100% in <em>positive thinking</em> mode. That competitor who is stealing your customers is “such a nice guy.” That cup of coffee made of some dark powder is “very delicious.” The programmers from Pakistan you found on Upwork for $10 per hour are “absolutely awesome.” The marketing plan you invented yesterday is “simply great.” Never admit any mistakes, risks, or threats. Simply ignore them. Stay positive. Investors like that.</p><p><strong>Bluff</strong>. You have to mention that the market is absolutely huge, at least a hundred billion dollars. They won’t be able to check anyway. Actually, nobody can check that, so don’t worry. But don’t give a round number; that would be a mistake! It should sound more like $73.5 billion. That’s very convincing and will give them the confidence you need—the market is huge and you’re not just saying it; you actually did some math. How can they not invest in such a huge and promising market?</p><p><strong>Scream</strong>. Especially if you’re in a public place, you must speak as if you’re a bit deaf. Be loud. That will prove that you’re absolutely confident in what you’re saying, today and always. The investor will be sure you are capable of attracting <del>mates</del> customers and other investors, if for no other reason than because you’re not afraid of being that ugly loud in public. You’re 100% extrovert—you must demonstrate it shamelessly.</p><aside class="quote">You must be ready to shine their shoes, with a big smile on your face</aside><p><strong>Beg</strong>. You may mistakenly think that this is a balanced transaction—they give money and you give part of your equity. You may expect that both parties are equally interested in this. But don’t make that mistake. You’re begging, and they are giving. Out of courtesy. That’s a win position for you. By having money, they expect to be on top of others. This is what capitalism is about, right? Don’t take this away from them. You must be ready to shine their shoes. With a big smile on your face.</p><p><strong>Love</strong>. The truth is that investors don’t want to make money. They want to make love. You’re a perfect candidate. They are mostly old, rich, lonely, and miserable. Their success stories are behind them. All they have is money, which they are afraid to spend because they understand that they won’t make it again. They are used-to-be successful gamblers, but not anymore. Give them what they want: love. Money is not so important, so long as you love each other. Remember, first they must fall in love with you, then they will send the terms sheet.</p><p>Did I miss anything?</p><p>Rehearse your pitch in front of the mirror in the bathroom three times every morning.

Basically, your success doesn’t depend on much of anything else. The pitch is king. You have to impress the <del>catcher</del> investor in just a few seconds while the elevator is still moving (that’s where you are supposed to hunt for that prey). It’s not rocket science; you can learn a few basic principles and become a expert. Here they are, the principles.</p><figure class="jb_picture"><img itemprop="image" alt="Huevos de oro (1993) by Bigas Luna" src="/images/2016/03/huevos-de-oro.jpg" longdesc="#06c2164b" /><figcaption id="06c2164b">Huevos de oro (1993) by Bigas Luna</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Look</strong>. Rule number 1: You must look right, like Mark Zuckerberg—the same gray T-shirt every day with the same smile. The way you look must demonstrate that you’re part of the community. You’re one of us! These three things will help: a beard, an electric skateboard, and an Apple Watch. If you’re a girl, replace the beard with a yoga mat and you’re all set. By looking that way, you’re telling investors that your chances to succeed are way higher than anyone who doesn’t have an Apple Watch and is a stranger because of that.</p><aside class="quote">Anyone who doesn't have an Apple Watch is a stranger</aside><p><strong>Innovate</strong>. These are the words you must include in your pitch: innovation, innovative, innovate. It’s never too many. Put them (or their synonyms) everywhere; it’s all for good. How about this: “Our innovative solution is an environmental breakthrough?” Nobody knows what it means, but everybody understands that you’re a big-time innovator. Even if it’s yet another calorie calculator. Investors must understand that you’re not just making a software product; you <em>innovate</em>.</p><p><strong>Complicate</strong>. Internet of Things in lieu of a thermometer, augmented reality instead of goggles with a camera, and global health rather than a database of dentists. You get the idea. Don’t be specific; it’s dangerous. They may ask you what kind of database it is and how it’s different than the other 50 databases on the market. But if you say global health, they won’t have any idea what you’re talking about, which is exactly what you need. Learn those words and use them whenever possible. Here are some of my favorites for you to remember: business model canvas, viral mechanics, growth hacking, data-driven mentality, design thinking, and game-changing disruption.</p><aside class="quote">But be careful, don't overact or you may end up in a mental hospital</aside><p><strong>Smile</strong>. You are super excited about this fantastic opportunity! You’re extremely motivated to do this project with these absolutely great people! You’re passionate about the idea and fully committed to implementing it! You love the team, the partners, the investors, and the customers—they’re all very nice people you’re happy to work with! You’re very enthusiastic about everything! You love everyone! … But be careful; don’t overact or you may end up in a mental hospital.</p><p><strong>Compare</strong>. Compare yourself to Uber; you will never lose. It was Airbnb a few years ago and Dropbox before that. Today it’s Uber. Start your pitch with “It’s like Uber but …” No matter what you put after that, it will work. All investors are dreaming about getting a new Uber in their portfolio. You should help them make this dream come true. There’s no need to be too complicated; just say you’re “like Uber but …” and your chances to score Round A will jump higher.</p><p><strong>Imitate</strong>. Elon Musk! You have to mention this guy; you absolutely must. Try this: “As Elon Musk said in his book, it is very difficult to build a successful startup.” You, being aware of wisdom like that, give them the impression that you’re related to the Silicon Valley culture, which is what they want to feel. Always try to show that Elon Musk is a role model for you. Having a T-shirt featuring his face will also help. By the way, don’t use Steve Jobs; it’s not a trend anymore. Moreover, he is dead already. Stick to Musk.</p><aside class="quote">Never compete with them or even try to argue, investors are always right</aside><p><strong>Respect</strong>. Always remember that you and your potential investors are not equal. They have money, experience, reputation, and a Tesla. You have nothing. You must demonstrate that you always remember that. Always position yourself a bit lower, play newbie, ask questions, and imitate interest in everything they say. Never compete with them or even try to argue! They are always right, and they are simply awesome; you’re just another nobody. Something like “I’m honored to be in the same room with you” is a very good opener.</p><p><strong>Co-Found</strong>. You absolutely must have a co-founder, or even a few of them. They could be anybody. A roommate will work or just a friend of a friend who recently quit her full-time job. It doesn’t matter who they are as long as you can call them co-founders. Put their pictures and names on your website and always say “we” instead of “I.” Investors, in general, love to have a few phone numbers they can call when they realize their money is gone and there is nothing left. Also, it’s more fun to invest into a group of people—investors look more serious in that case.</p><aside class="quote">Never admit any mistakes or risks, simply ignore them, stay positive</aside><p><strong>Radiate</strong>. Never say anything bad about anything or anyone. You literally have to be 100% in <em>positive thinking</em> mode. That competitor who is stealing your customers is “such a nice guy.” That cup of coffee made of some dark powder is “very delicious.” The programmers from Pakistan you found on Upwork for $10 per hour are “absolutely awesome.” The marketing plan you invented yesterday is “simply great.” Never admit any mistakes, risks, or threats. Simply ignore them. Stay positive. Investors like that.</p><p><strong>Bluff</strong>. You have to mention that the market is absolutely huge, at least a hundred billion dollars. They won’t be able to check anyway. Actually, nobody can check that, so don’t worry. But don’t give a round number; that would be a mistake! It should sound more like $73.5 billion. That’s very convincing and will give them the confidence you need—the market is huge and you’re not just saying it; you actually did some math. How can they not invest in such a huge and promising market?</p><p><strong>Scream</strong>. Especially if you’re in a public place, you must speak as if you’re a bit deaf. Be loud. That will prove that you’re absolutely confident in what you’re saying, today and always. The investor will be sure you are capable of attracting <del>mates</del> customers and other investors, if for no other reason than because you’re not afraid of being that ugly loud in public. You’re 100% extrovert—you must demonstrate it shamelessly.</p><aside class="quote">You must be ready to shine their shoes, with a big smile on your face</aside><p><strong>Beg</strong>. You may mistakenly think that this is a balanced transaction—they give money and you give part of your equity. You may expect that both parties are equally interested in this. But don’t make that mistake. You’re begging, and they are giving. Out of courtesy. That’s a win position for you. By having money, they expect to be on top of others. This is what capitalism is about, right? Don’t take this away from them. You must be ready to shine their shoes. With a big smile on your face.</p><p><strong>Love</strong>. The truth is that investors don’t want to make money. They want to make love. You’re a perfect candidate. They are mostly old, rich, lonely, and miserable. Their success stories are behind them. All they have is money, which they are afraid to spend because they understand that they won’t make it again. They are used-to-be successful gamblers, but not anymore. Give them what they want: love. Money is not so important, so long as you love each other. Remember, first they must fall in love with you, then they will send the terms sheet.</p><p>Did I miss anything?</p><p>Rehearse your pitch in front of the mirror in the bathroom three times every morning. I guarantee that in fewer than two weeks, you will sound like a proper SV startup founder. Well, a co-founder—don’t forget that. Good luck; you will need a lot of it!</p></p><nav class="buttons notranslate desktop-only"> <a href="http://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://www.yegor256.com/2016/03/28/unspoken-secrets-of-elevator-pitch.html" title="Share on Facebook" class="button" rel="nofollow"> <span class="count count-facebook">0</span> <i class="icon icon-facebook notranslate" aria-hidden="true"></i> </a> <a href="https://twitter.com/share?url=https://www.yegor256.com/2016/03/28/unspoken-secrets-of-elevator-pitch.html&amp;text=Unspoken+Secrets+of+an+Elevator+Pitch" title="Share on Twitter" class="button" rel="nofollow"> <span class="count count-twitter">0</span> <i class="icon icon-twitter notranslate" aria-hidden="true"></i> </a> <a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=https://www.yegor256.com/2016/03/28/unspoken-secrets-of-elevator-pitch.html" title="Share on Google+" class="button" rel="nofollow"> <span class="count count-googleplus">0</span> <i class="icon icon-googleplus notranslate" aria-hidden="true"></i> </a> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/cws/share?url=https://www.yegor256.com/2016/03/28/unspoken-secrets-of-elevator-pitch.html" title="Share on LinkedIn" class="button" rel="nofollow"> <span class="count count-linkedin">0</span> <i class="icon icon-linkedin notranslate" aria-hidden="true"></i> </a> <a href="http://reddit.com/submit?url=https://www.yegor256.com/2016/03/28/unspoken-secrets-of-elevator-pitch.html%3F2016-13&amp;title=Unspoken+Secrets+of+an+Elevator+Pitch" title="Share on Reddit" class="button" rel="nofollow"> <span class="count count-reddit">0</span> <i class="icon icon-reddit notranslate" aria-hidden="true"></i> </a> <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/submitlink?u=https://www.yegor256.com/2016/03/28/unspoken-secrets-of-elevator-pitch.html%3F2016-13&amp;t=Unspoken+Secrets+of+an+Elevator+Pitch" title="Share on Hacker News" class="button" rel="nofollow"> <span class="count count-hackernews">0</span> <i class="icon icon-hackernews notranslate" aria-hidden="true"></i> </a> </nav> </header> <article class="main" itemprop="articleBody"><div ><p>Your success depends on the quality of your <strong>elevator pitch</strong>.

The formula is simple: You schedule an interview, we have a one-hour conversation, you present me your startup idea, and we either give you cash right away or explain why we don’t feel like it. We don’t do any due diligence or background checks. The decision is made right there. It’s something similar to angel investment, but the amount is smaller—less than <strong>$20K</strong>, and decisions are faster.</p><figure class="jb_picture"><img itemprop="image" alt="The Game (1997) by David Fincher" src="/images/2015/12/the-game.jpg" longdesc="#7b083988" /><figcaption id="7b083988">The Game (1997) by David Fincher</figcaption></figure><p>There are basically three problems we’re trying to solve with this new idea: 1) Investors are <strong>cowards</strong>, 2) investors are <strong>cowards</strong>, and 3) investors are <strong>cowards</strong>. Here is why.</p><h2 id="they-are-afraid-of-strangers">They Are Afraid of Strangers</h2><p>It’s no secret that Silicon Valley is very “<strong>corrupted</strong>” territory, where in order to get access to money people, you must know some other money people or someone who knows someone, etc. You must be <strong>well-connected</strong> in order to be successful. You simply can’t raise money just by having an awesome idea or even a great implementation. You need connections.</p><p>I think that’s disgusting.</p><p>I am, in general, a big fan of <strong>meritocracy</strong>, where those who are smarter or stronger win the most. This is the principle we, at <a href="https://www.zerocracy.com">Zerocracy</a>, apply to software developers who come to us. I explained it last year in this rather popular and provocative post: <a href="/2014/10/29/how-much-do-you-cost.html">How Much Do You Cost?</a>. We simply don’t care how many years of experience you have, how much time you’ve spent with your previous employer, or how many programming languages you know. We only care about your objective achievements, which are validated by the market. And, of course, we don’t pay attention to any references or any previous relationships.</p><aside class="quote">We simply don't care how many years of experience you have</aside><p>I strongly believe this is how it should be.</p><p>Unfortunately, this is not how it is in Silicon Valley when a young startup is looking for $100K to $150K of seed money. Angel investors are difficult to reach. They are afraid of you, if you come out of nowhere. They only want to talk to someone they can <strong>complain</strong> about to their friends. This basically encourages startup founders to spend their time on friend-making activities instead of business-making ones. Very often, good teams simply <strong>miss</strong> their chance.</p><h2 id="they-are-afraid-of-telling-the-truth">They Are Afraid of Telling the Truth</h2><p>Have you ever talked to a venture capital firm? To angel investors? To any investors, basically? If you have, you’d know they all are very <strong>polite</strong>, nodding their heads and smiling while listening to your <a href="/2016/03/28/unspoken-secrets-of-elevator-pitch.html">pitch</a>. They usually are “very excited” to meet you and “learn more” about your business.</p><p>In the end, they don’t give you the money.</p><p>Why? Who knows. They won’t tell you. They are cowards, and they are afraid of telling you that your idea sucks and your business plan is totally wrong. They are afraid of being <strong>honest</strong>.</p><aside class="quote">They are afraid of telling you that your idea sucks</aside><p>There is an almost identical situation with recruitment. You send your <a href="/2016/03/08/pimp-up-your-resume.html">resume</a> to Facebook, they interview you, and you spend a few hours with them, answering their questions. In the end, they email you, saying “We decided not to proceed any further; good luck in your job search.” They are afraid of telling you the <strong>truth</strong>.</p><p>And it’s disgusting.</p><p>In our recruitment process at <a href="https://www.zerocracy.com">Zerocracy</a>, we do exactly the opposite. You apply to us, we ask one of our programmers to <a href="/2016/03/01/how-we-interview-programmers.html">interview</a> you, and then, when finished, we make a decision about whether you’re a good candidate or not. We discuss your profile right in front of you. We don’t have any discussions without you. We make our decision fully disclosing our reasoning to you. This is how it should be everywhere, I believe.

Its name is <a href="http://www.seedramp.com">SeedRamp</a>. The formula is simple: You schedule an interview, we have a one-hour conversation, you present me your startup idea, and we either give you cash right away or explain why we don’t feel like it. We don’t do any due diligence or background checks. The decision is made right there. It’s something similar to angel investment, but the amount is smaller—less than <strong>$20K</strong>, and decisions are faster.</p><figure class="jb_picture"><img itemprop="image" alt="The Game (1997) by David Fincher" src="/images/2015/12/the-game.jpg" longdesc="#7b083988" /><figcaption id="7b083988">The Game (1997) by David Fincher</figcaption></figure><p>There are basically three problems we’re trying to solve with this new idea: 1) Investors are <strong>cowards</strong>, 2) investors are <strong>cowards</strong>, and 3) investors are <strong>cowards</strong>. Here is why.</p><h2 id="they-are-afraid-of-strangers">They Are Afraid of Strangers</h2><p>It’s no secret that Silicon Valley is very “<strong>corrupted</strong>” territory, where in order to get access to money people, you must know some other money people or someone who knows someone, etc. You must be <strong>well-connected</strong> in order to be successful. You simply can’t raise money just by having an awesome idea or even a great implementation. You need connections.</p><p>I think that’s disgusting.</p><p>I am, in general, a big fan of <strong>meritocracy</strong>, where those who are smarter or stronger win the most. This is the principle we, at <a href="https://www.zerocracy.com">Zerocracy</a>, apply to software developers who come to us. I explained it last year in this rather popular and provocative post: <a href="/2014/10/29/how-much-do-you-cost.html">How Much Do You Cost?</a>. We simply don’t care how many years of experience you have, how much time you’ve spent with your previous employer, or how many programming languages you know. We only care about your objective achievements, which are validated by the market. And, of course, we don’t pay attention to any references or any previous relationships.</p><aside class="quote">We simply don't care how many years of experience you have</aside><p>I strongly believe this is how it should be.</p><p>Unfortunately, this is not how it is in Silicon Valley when a young startup is looking for $100K to $150K of seed money. Angel investors are difficult to reach. They are afraid of you, if you come out of nowhere. They only want to talk to someone they can <strong>complain</strong> about to their friends. This basically encourages startup founders to spend their time on friend-making activities instead of business-making ones. Very often, good teams simply <strong>miss</strong> their chance.</p><h2 id="they-are-afraid-of-telling-the-truth">They Are Afraid of Telling the Truth</h2><p>Have you ever talked to a venture capital firm? To angel investors? To any investors, basically? If you have, you’d know they all are very <strong>polite</strong>, nodding their heads and smiling while listening to your <a href="/2016/03/28/unspoken-secrets-of-elevator-pitch.html">pitch</a>. They usually are “very excited” to meet you and “learn more” about your business.</p><p>In the end, they don’t give you the money.</p><p>Why? Who knows. They won’t tell you. They are cowards, and they are afraid of telling you that your idea sucks and your business plan is totally wrong. They are afraid of being <strong>honest</strong>.</p><aside class="quote">They are afraid of telling you that your idea sucks</aside><p>There is an almost identical situation with recruitment. You send your <a href="/2016/03/08/pimp-up-your-resume.html">resume</a> to Facebook, they interview you, and you spend a few hours with them, answering their questions. In the end, they email you, saying “We decided not to proceed any further; good luck in your job search.” They are afraid of telling you the <strong>truth</strong>.</p><p>And it’s disgusting.</p><p>In our recruitment process at <a href="https://www.zerocracy.com">Zerocracy</a>, we do exactly the opposite. You apply to us, we ask one of our programmers to <a href="/2016/03/01/how-we-interview-programmers.html">interview</a> you, and then, when finished, we make a decision about whether you’re a good candidate or not. We discuss your profile right in front of you. We don’t have any discussions without you. We make our decision fully disclosing our reasoning to you. This is how it should be everywhere, I believe. Especially with regard to investments.</p><h2 id="they-are-afraid-of-losses">They are Afraid of Losses</h2><p>It’s a very infamous problem, mentioned everywhere there’s a list of “top 10 reasons for startup failures.” Investors simply turn you into an <strong>employee</strong>. Before you get their money, you’re on your own. You make your own decisions, you manage your business, you’re in charge.</p><p>Then, you get the money. It doesn’t mean you’re <strong>rich</strong>. Not at all. It means that, from now on, you’re their employee. They decide what your salary is. They decide whether you can rent this office or not. They decide what car you can afford.</p><p>Keep in mind that your salary is lower than your friends are getting, working somewhere on Facebook. Your salary is low, and you can’t change it. All your expenses have to be approved. You’re simply under the full control of your <strong>board</strong>.</p><aside class="quote">They are trying to win in poker by always making small bets</aside><p>Why is that?
