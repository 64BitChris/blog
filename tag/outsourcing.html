customer &lt;del&gt;is an idiot&lt;/del&gt; doesn’t really know what he needs—not only in terms of functionality, but also on a technical level. What makes the situation even worse is that the customer &lt;del&gt;very often&lt;/del&gt; always thinks he knows and understands enough. The question is how do you teach a customer? How do you train, educate, and help him? You don’t!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;!--more--&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;jb_picture&quot;&gt;&lt;img itemprop=&quot;image&quot; alt=&quot;The Firm (1993) by Sydney Pollack&quot; src=&quot;/images/2017/01/the-firm.jpg&quot; longdesc=&quot;#fa67e914&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption id=&quot;fa67e914&quot;&gt;The Firm (1993) by Sydney Pollack&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;The temptation will be huge, though. You will think that the customer is your friend. You will want to help him. You will feel very motivated to make the product better. Moreover, you have the needed knowledge, so why not share it, right?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Wrong. Very wrong. On so many levels.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Most of all because the customer is not your friend. Not a partner, not a co-worker, not a colleague, and not a teammate. The customer is a project &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/01/26/happy-boss-false-objective.html&quot;&gt;stakeholder&lt;/a&gt;, just like you, but his needs are completely opposite of yours, and he is very aware of that.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Very soon, when the project fails, the customer will find someone to blame&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;He wants the project to finish as soon as possible and to take as little &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/06/02/how-to-estimate-software-cost.html&quot;&gt;money&lt;/a&gt; out of his pocket as possible. You want exactly the opposite. You both work for the project, but from two very different angles.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Very soon, when the project fails (and it will fail, just like 94 percent of all software projects, according to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.projectsmart.co.uk/white-papers/chaos-report.pdf&quot;&gt;Chaos Report&lt;/a&gt;), the customer will find someone to blame. Needless to say, he won’t blame himself; he will blame you.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to the same report, only 7 percent of failures are caused by technical incompetence. Thus, most likely your project will fail because of an incorrect understanding of requirements, poor planning, misalignment of management objectives, etc. Do you really want to be blamed for the things you’re not an expert at? Let the customer fail; it’s his project, his life, and his money.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Do your technical job right and stay away from everything else. This is what true professionalism is about—focus on the things you can do best of all and better than most others.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, if you see that he is doing something wrong and definitely requires help, recommend that he hire a consultant. There are many people in the market who can help him with requirements, UX, business analysis, marketing planning, branding, etc. In most cases, customers just don’t know that these people exist, or they believe these services are just a waste of money.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Try to convince them that it’s not true, but don’t become an adviser in something you don’t understand. Your job is coding, so focus only on that.&lt;/p&gt; "/> <meta name="twitter:url" property="og:url" content="https://www.yegor256.com/2017/01/10/how-to-teach-customers.html"/> <meta

It’s cheap, right? Right. What would you say if I told you this cheap Java developer hardly writes two primitive lines of code per day? You’re paying $600 every week but rarely getting anything back. How cheap is this Java guy now? My point is that using hourly rate as a cost indicator is a very bad idea, whether with &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/10/27/outsourcing-doesnt-work.html&quot;&gt;outsourcing&lt;/a&gt; or in-house teams.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;!--more--&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;jb_picture&quot;&gt;&lt;img itemprop=&quot;image&quot; alt=&quot;The Fan (1996) by Tony Scott&quot; src=&quot;/images/2016/01/the-fan.jpg&quot; longdesc=&quot;#5b31fba6&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption id=&quot;5b31fba6&quot;&gt;The Fan (1996) by Tony Scott&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;I actually decided to write this after a short sales meeting recently with a prospect from Illinois. He wanted to hire &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zerocracy.com&quot;&gt;Zerocracy&lt;/a&gt; for his Java project and seemed to like our approach. I explained how we work, how we control &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/08/13/strict-code-quality-control.html&quot;&gt;quality&lt;/a&gt;, and why and how we’re &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/04/17/how-xdsd-is-different.html&quot;&gt;different&lt;/a&gt; from everybody else. He seemed to be impressed. Then, he asked, “&lt;em&gt;How much&lt;/em&gt; do you charge?”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;badge&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zerocracy.com&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;//www.0crat.com/svg/logo.svg&quot; style=&quot;width:100px;max-width:100%;&quot; alt=&quot;badge&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;I told him that we are also different in the way we bill for our work, because we don’t charge for the time spent by our programmers sitting in front of monitors. Instead, we bill for &lt;em&gt;results&lt;/em&gt; produced, merged, and delivered. I showed him this article about &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/10/21/incremental-billing.html&quot;&gt;incremental billing&lt;/a&gt;. He seemed to understand the advantages of our approach, compared to the &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/07/21/hourly-pay-modern-slavery.html&quot;&gt;hourly salaries&lt;/a&gt; being paid by &lt;del&gt;almost&lt;/del&gt; everybody else in the market.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Still, the question remained—how much?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What could I do? I had to give him an answer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Under different management, programmers deliver very different results in the same 60 minutes.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;I told him that our best Java programmers earn $30 to $50 per hour and we add our margin on top of that, in the amount of 100 percent, for management. In the end, “one hour” will cost him $60 to $100. He ran away.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What did I do wrong? I think I know what it was. I didn’t explain to him that, under different management, programmers deliver very different results in the same 60 minutes. By “very different,” I mean &lt;em&gt;dramatically&lt;/em&gt; different. Let me demonstrate the numbers (I actually did that already almost two years ago, in my &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/04/11/cost-of-loc.html&quot;&gt;How Much Do You Pay Per Line of Code?&lt;/a&gt; post, but will try again from a different perspective).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Take a look at &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/yegor256/takes/issues/430&quot;&gt;yegor256/takes#430&lt;/a&gt;, a feature request in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.takes.org&quot;&gt;Takes Framework&lt;/a&gt;, one of the projects we’re managing. Let’s see how much the project paid for the work done in this ticket:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;15 minutes to me for creating a new ticket&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;30 minutes to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/hdouss&quot;&gt;@hdous&lt;/a&gt; for fixing it&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;52 minutes to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/pinaf&quot;&gt;@pinaf&lt;/a&gt; for code review&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;20 minutes to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ypshenychka&quot;&gt;@ypshenychka&lt;/a&gt; for QA review&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Assuming that an average price “per hour” is $50 ($25 for developers and $25 for our management), the total cost of this new feature was $97.50 (117 minutes).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Look at these two tickets again. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/yegor256/takes/issues/430&quot;&gt;#430&lt;/a&gt; is the feature request and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/yegor256/takes/issues/493&quot;&gt;#493&lt;/a&gt; is the pull request with two new Java files and code review comments.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Four people worked on this feature. If you put them all together in an office, full-time, with the same hourly rate, they will cost $800 per day (I’m not adding any management costs!). Now the question is whether they will be able to create &lt;em&gt;eight&lt;/em&gt; new features &lt;em&gt;every day&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you’re a manager, you know the velocity of your programmers. If you’re a programmer, you know how much code you can write in a day. Now, honestly tell me if you find and solve eight bugs per day with that level of complexity, detailed code review, and precision of documentation? I seriously doubt it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;badge&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.xdsd.org&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.xdsd.org/images/logo.svg&quot; style=&quot;width:100px;max-width:100%;&quot; alt=&quot;badge&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;In that &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/04/11/cost-of-loc.html&quot;&gt;How Much Do You Pay Per Line of Code?&lt;/a&gt; post, I actually did a comparison of a co-located project, where I was an architect, with a distributed one, where I also was an architect. My numbers tell me that a traditionally managed team is at least 10 times less productive than a team managed by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zerocracy.com&quot;&gt;Zerocracy&lt;/a&gt; under &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.xdsd.org&quot;&gt;XDSD&lt;/a&gt; principles.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;My point is that asking “What is your hourly rate?” is just as wrong as asking &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/06/02/how-to-estimate-software-cost.html&quot;&gt;How Much for This Software?&lt;/a&gt; if we’re talking about software developers motivated by results, not &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/10/06/how-to-be-good-office-slave.html&quot;&gt;office slaves&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Instead, we should ask: How much can you do for $100?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As you can see, we can easily demonstrate how much we are capable of delivering for $100. Can you and your team do the same?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thus, your &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return_on_investment&quot;&gt;ROI&lt;/a&gt; while working with an &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/05/21/avoid-software-outsourcing-disaster.html&quot;&gt;outsourced team&lt;/a&gt; mostly depends on their &lt;em&gt;results per dollar&lt;/em&gt;, not dollars per hour. The first metric is difficult to calculate, and only the best teams will be able to do so. The second metric is absolutely misleading, but anyone will give it to you.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;An &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/06/15/software-outsourcing-survival-guide.html&quot;&gt;outsourced team&lt;/a&gt; is expensive when its results per dollar are low, no matter how big or small its dollars-per-hour rate is. To the contrary, a team is financially very efficient if its results per dollar is high. It doesn’t really matter what the value of the second metric is.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;P.S. I’m going to show this article to that prospect who ran away. Maybe he will come back :)&lt;/p&gt; "/> <meta name="twitter:url" property="og:url" content="https://www.yegor256.com/2016/01/19/how-expensive-is-outsourcing.html"/> <meta name="telegram:channel"

it this way: $15 per hour for a senior Java developer—is that cheap or expensive? It’s cheap, right? Right. What would you say if I told you this cheap Java developer hardly writes two primitive lines of code per day? You’re paying $600 every week but rarely getting anything back. How cheap is this Java guy now?

Of course, in bigger companies and bigger projects, the story will be different. But the outcome is almost always the same—it is &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/06/15/software-outsourcing-survival-guide.html&quot;&gt;a disaster&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;All these reasons merely explain the consequences but never even touch the real problem&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;I’m talking about outsourcing, not offshore development. The difference is that in outsourcing, there are two companies involved: you the &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/01/26/happy-boss-false-objective.html&quot;&gt;client&lt;/a&gt; and some WeCodeLikeNoOneElse Inc. from Loompaland. In offshore development, you just open an &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/10/06/how-to-be-good-office-slave.html&quot;&gt;office&lt;/a&gt; in that same Loompaland with your own management and employees. Again, I’m discussing &lt;strong&gt;outsourcing&lt;/strong&gt; here.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Before writing this, I read &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=why+outsourcing+fails&quot;&gt;a few dozen articles&lt;/a&gt; about why outsourcing fails, and I’ve found a dozen “reasons” why. However, I think they all miss the point, because they are looking at the problem from a paying customer’s point of view. I try to look at it from both sides and tell you the ugly truth. More on that in a few paragraphs. For now, let’s explore what the usual reasons are.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;youtube&quot;&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9j5pq71BS5U&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;box&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9j5pq71BS5U/mqdefault.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;YouTube video #9j5pq71BS5U&quot; /&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;play&quot;&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;icon icon-play&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;div&gt;Software Outsourcing, 10 Years Ahead (in Russian with English subtitles); 9 April 2016.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cheapest Providers&lt;/strong&gt;. Here is the argument: “So you’re outsourcing because you want to optimize &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/06/02/how-to-estimate-software-cost.html&quot;&gt;costs&lt;/a&gt;? You will end up with the cheapest software shop and sincerely regret it very soon.” OK, what’s the solution, then? Just pay more? I don’t think that’s going to solve the problem; I’ll just burn &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/06/02/how-to-estimate-software-cost.html&quot;&gt;more money&lt;/a&gt;. Also, I don’t think this reason has anything to do with outsourcing specifically. In any other business transaction, a “win-lose” scenario is a straight path to failure.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cultural Mismatch&lt;/strong&gt;. “You’re in California, and they are in Brazil; you won’t understand each other.” Is that why we have &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost_overrun&quot;&gt;cost overruns&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_slippage&quot;&gt;schedule slippage&lt;/a&gt;, and low quality of code? I don’t think so. Moreover, my experience tells me the opposite. Our programmers at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zerocracy.com&quot;&gt;Zerocracy&lt;/a&gt; are from more than 15 countries, and we’ve never had cultural issues get tangled up in any &lt;a href=&quot;/2017/01/03/how-much-you-love-conflicts.html&quot;&gt;work conflict&lt;/a&gt;, which we have a lot of.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lack of Face-to-Face Talking&lt;/strong&gt;. “They are far away somewhere in Poland, so you rarely really talk to them. That’s why you misunderstand each other.” Look, have you ever met me and had a face-to-face talk with me? I’m talking to you, the reader of this post. That’s right, you haven’t met me, but you’re having no problem understanding my point just by reading this text. That’s mostly because I’ve made all possible efforts to ensure my point is clear to you. I’m interested in delivering my thoughts to you, and it is happening. In outsourcing, the problem is not with the channel but with the motivation. Read on.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No Metrics to Measure Success&lt;/strong&gt;. “You simply can’t define clear metrics of success for a team overseas. That’s why your relationship eventually falls apart.” Or something like that. I didn’t quite get what’s meant by “metrics of success,” but if it’s what I think it is, they are right: Success for a software outsourcing shop in Kiev is one thing. Success for you, a client of this shop, is something very different. Read on.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Poor Specs&lt;/strong&gt;. “It’s just not possible to make good &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/11/10/ten-mistakes-in-specs.html&quot;&gt;specifications&lt;/a&gt; for most projects, and a poorly designed spec is a recipe for failure.” Yes, that’s very true, but what does this have to do with outsourcing? Ah, right, they are so far away in Argentina and we’re here in New York City—how can we make &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/10/20/how-we-write-product-vision.html&quot;&gt;a good spec&lt;/a&gt;? I don’t buy it. An inability to clearly and explicitly specify technical requirements is a flaw of the &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/10/12/who-is-software-architect.html&quot;&gt;architect&lt;/a&gt;. Learning, training, and reading should fix this. Getting everybody together in the &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/10/06/how-to-be-good-office-slave.html&quot;&gt;office&lt;/a&gt; is &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/10/07/stop-chatting-start-coding.html&quot;&gt;not a solution&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leakage of Talent&lt;/strong&gt;. “Developers offshore are not your employees. They will never be loyal to the project, and the best of them will quit once in a while.” Yes, people may leave once in a while. But again, how is that related to their location? If they don’t use the same coffee machine as their CEO, will they be less loyal to the project? There are &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/03/02/team-morale-myths-and-reality.html&quot;&gt;many other&lt;/a&gt; more effective instruments to boost motivation in a team than just co-locating everybody.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There could be much more, but this is enough for us. As you see, I don’t find these “reasons” logical. They merely explain the consequences but never even touch the real problem, which I believe sounds like this:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You’re just a &lt;strong&gt;cash cow&lt;/strong&gt; for an outsourcing company.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You’re neither a partner nor a friend, despite all your expectations.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Your goals are opposite of their goals.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;All these “reasons” for outsourcing failures originate in this fundamental confusion that exists in our heads: We think these 10 programmers sitting in Beijing are part of our business. We believe they are our team. They are with us in the same boat, sharing the same values and looking in the same direction.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s just not true&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It can’t be true.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I’ve been in the shoes of an outsourcing company for almost 10 years (and quit in 2010). The ugly truth is that for a CEO of an outsourcing shop, the only problem is how to take care of the next month’s payroll, and &lt;strong&gt;90 percent&lt;/strong&gt; of all expenses are salaries for the programmers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Your business interests can't be aligned with the interests of your outsourcing partner&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;That’s why a good customer for them is a paying customer. Not a customer with a successful project. Not a customer with a properly solved problem. Not a customer with &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/10/21/incremental-billing.html&quot;&gt;optimized costs&lt;/a&gt;. Not a customer with the best possible technology utilized. Not at all. The best customer is the one that pays, pays a lot, and pays on time. Period.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That’s the root cause of all problems with outsourcing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The title of this article states that outsourcing doesn’t work &lt;strong&gt;anymore&lt;/strong&gt;. Why anymore? Did it work before? Yes, it did, when salaries of programmers were extremely lower in third-world (offshore) countries. For example, in 2001, we had a team of very good senior Java developers in Ukraine. We paid them above the market price, and it was &lt;strong&gt;$300 per month&lt;/strong&gt;. At the same time, we were selling their time to U.S. customers for $15 per hour, which was $2,500 per month. See the margin?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With such a margin, outsourcing works fine. I was a CEO and had almost no worries about payroll. I had enough money to pay my team, even if we lost some customers eventually. Let me put it this way: I had the &lt;strong&gt;luxury&lt;/strong&gt; to be &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/01/05/how-to-be-honest-and-keep-customer.html&quot;&gt;honest&lt;/a&gt; with my customers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Not anymore.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Put yourself in their shoes. Today, a good Java developer in Ukraine &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.payscale.com/research/UA/Job=Senior_Java_Developer/Salary&quot;&gt;earns&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;$4,000&lt;/strong&gt; a month. On top of that, this developer expects health insurance, a free gym membership, free lunch, paid vacation, paid sick leave, etc. At the same time, the price of Java time is not much higher on the market than it was years ago. Even if you charge $40 per hour (which is very unlikely), your income would be $6,800. Again, your income is $6.8K and your expenses are close to $5K. See the margin?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Your lone motivation is to keep that cash flow coming. No matter what.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;And don’t forget about office expenses, taxes, computers, administrative staff, team building events, etc. Because of such a small margin, you will literally be broke if you lose a key paying customer. You just can’t afford to keep your programmers “on the &lt;strong&gt;bench&lt;/strong&gt;” for too long.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thus, your lone motivation is to keep that cash flow coming. No matter what. The longer the project, the better. The lower the quality of code, the better—more money for maintenance. The more phone calls, meetings and other time-wasting events, the better. The more mess in specs, the better. Just do whatever it takes to suck money from the customer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You have to do this, not because you’re evil but because you have to feed your team. Your team. Yes, the team is &lt;strong&gt;yours&lt;/strong&gt;. You’re responsible for their salaries, not the customer. In order to protect the team, you have to go against the real interests of your customers. You simply can’t be in the same boat with them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The point of all this is that outsourcing simply can’t work, because your business interests can’t be aligned with the interests of your outsourcing “partner.”&lt;/p&gt; "/> <meta name="twitter:url" property="og:url" content="https://www.yegor256.com/2015/10/27/outsourcing-doesnt-work.html"/> <meta name="telegram:channel" content="AAAAAEJFMRzsRTRxM3ec6A"/> <link rel="search" type="application/opensearchdescription+xml" href="/opensearch.xml" title="yegor256" /> <link rel="shortcut icon" href="/favicon.ico?c401938d07c"/> <link rel="apple-touch-icon" href="/favicon.ico?c401938d07c"/> <link rel="alternate" type="application/rss+xml" title="RSS for yegor256.com" href="https://www.yegor256.com/rss.xml"/> <link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/layout.css?c401938d07c"/> <link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/icons.css?c401938d07c"/> <link rel="canonical" href="https://www.yegor256.com/2015/10/27/outsourcing-doesnt-work.html" /> <link rel="amphtml" href="https://www.yegor256.com/2015/10/27/outsourcing-doesnt-work.amp.html" /> <title>Why Software Outsourcing Doesn't Work ...

In offshore development, you just open an <a href="/2015/10/06/how-to-be-good-office-slave.html">office</a> in that same Loompaland with your own management and employees.

However, I think they all miss the point, because they are looking at the problem from a paying customer’s point of view. I try to look at it from both sides and tell you the ugly truth. More on that in a few paragraphs. For now, let’s explore what the usual reasons are.</p><aside class="youtube"> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9j5pq71BS5U"><div class="box"> <img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9j5pq71BS5U/mqdefault.jpg" alt="YouTube video #9j5pq71BS5U" /><div class="play"><i class="icon icon-play"></i></div></div></a><div>Software Outsourcing, 10 Years Ahead (in Russian with English subtitles); 9 April 2016.</div></aside><p><strong>Cheapest Providers</strong>. Here is the argument: “So you’re outsourcing because you want to optimize <a href="/2015/06/02/how-to-estimate-software-cost.html">costs</a>? You will end up with the cheapest software shop and sincerely regret it very soon.” OK, what’s the solution, then? Just pay more? I don’t think that’s going to solve the problem; I’ll just burn <a href="/2015/06/02/how-to-estimate-software-cost.html">more money</a>. Also, I don’t think this reason has anything to do with outsourcing specifically. In any other business transaction, a “win-lose” scenario is a straight path to failure.</p><p><strong>Cultural Mismatch</strong>. “You’re in California, and they are in Brazil; you won’t understand each other.” Is that why we have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost_overrun">cost overruns</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_slippage">schedule slippage</a>, and low quality of code? I don’t think so. Moreover, my experience tells me the opposite. Our programmers at <a href="https://www.zerocracy.com">Zerocracy</a> are from more than 15 countries, and we’ve never had cultural issues get tangled up in any <a href="/2017/01/03/how-much-you-love-conflicts.html">work conflict</a>, which we have a lot of.</p><p><strong>Lack of Face-to-Face Talking</strong>. “They are far away somewhere in Poland, so you rarely really talk to them. That’s why you misunderstand each other.” Look, have you ever met me and had a face-to-face talk with me? I’m talking to you, the reader of this post. That’s right, you haven’t met me, but you’re having no problem understanding my point just by reading this text. That’s mostly because I’ve made all possible efforts to ensure my point is clear to you. I’m interested in delivering my thoughts to you, and it is happening. In outsourcing, the problem is not with the channel but with the motivation. Read on.</p><p><strong>No Metrics to Measure Success</strong>. “You simply can’t define clear metrics of success for a team overseas. That’s why your relationship eventually falls apart.” Or something like that. I didn’t quite get what’s meant by “metrics of success,” but if it’s what I think it is, they are right: Success for a software outsourcing shop in Kiev is one thing. Success for you, a client of this shop, is something very different. Read on.</p><p><strong>Poor Specs</strong>. “It’s just not possible to make good <a href="/2015/11/10/ten-mistakes-in-specs.html">specifications</a> for most projects, and a poorly designed spec is a recipe for failure.” Yes, that’s very true, but what does this have to do with outsourcing? Ah, right, they are so far away in Argentina and we’re here in New York City—how can we make <a href="/2014/10/20/how-we-write-product-vision.html">a good spec</a>? I don’t buy it. An inability to clearly and explicitly specify technical requirements is a flaw of the <a href="/2014/10/12/who-is-software-architect.html">architect</a>. Learning, training, and reading should fix this. Getting everybody together in the <a href="/2015/10/06/how-to-be-good-office-slave.html">office</a> is <a href="/2014/10/07/stop-chatting-start-coding.html">not a solution</a>.</p><p><strong>Leakage of Talent</strong>. “Developers offshore are not your employees. They will never be loyal to the project, and the best of them will quit once in a while.” Yes, people may leave once in a while. But again, how is that related to their location? If they don’t use the same coffee machine as their CEO, will they be less loyal to the project? There are <a href="/2015/03/02/team-morale-myths-and-reality.html">many other</a> more effective instruments to boost motivation in a team than just co-locating everybody.</p><p>There could be much more, but this is enough for us. As you see, I don’t find these “reasons” logical. They merely explain the consequences but never even touch the real problem, which I believe sounds like this:</p><p>You’re just a <strong>cash cow</strong> for an outsourcing company.</p><p>You’re neither a partner nor a friend, despite all your expectations.</p><p>Your goals are opposite of their goals.</p><p>All these “reasons” for outsourcing failures originate in this fundamental confusion that exists in our heads: We think these 10 programmers sitting in Beijing are part of our business.

It’s a &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/10/27/outsourcing-doesnt-work.html&quot;&gt;smart business practice&lt;/a&gt; being employed by everyone from $1,000 personal website owners to Fortune 100 monsters. And all of them fail, to some extent. Actually, it’s very difficult not to fail. Here is my list of simple hints to everyone who decides to outsource software development (the most important ones are at the bottom). I wish someone would have given it to me 15 years ago.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;!--more--&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;jb_picture&quot;&gt;&lt;img itemprop=&quot;image&quot; alt=&quot;U Turn (1997) by Oliver Stone&quot; src=&quot;/images/2015/06/u-turn.jpg&quot; longdesc=&quot;#2e6501cf&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption id=&quot;2e6501cf&quot;&gt;U Turn (1997) by Oliver Stone&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have a “Work for Hire” Agreement&lt;/strong&gt;. Make sure &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/05/04/how-to-protect-business-idea.html&quot;&gt;the contract&lt;/a&gt; you have with the &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/10/27/outsourcing-doesnt-work.html&quot;&gt;software outsourcing team&lt;/a&gt; includes something like this: “Parties shall deem all deliverables created by the developer as &lt;em&gt;works made for hire&lt;/em&gt; as is defined under the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.copyright.gov/title17/&quot;&gt;Copyright Law of the United States&lt;/a&gt;.” This is the shortest and easiest definition of “whatever you create for me is mine.” Put this into the contract and the outsourcing company won’t be able to claim that the software it created belongs to it, which happens here and there.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Own Your Source Code Repository&lt;/strong&gt;. Make sure the source code repository is under your control. The best way to do this is to create a private GitHub repository for &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/pricing&quot;&gt;$7 per month&lt;/a&gt;. The repository will be visible and accessible only by you and your outsourcing team. Moreover, make sure the team has read-only access and can’t change the code directly except through pull requests. In Git, it’s possible to destroy the entire history with a single “forced” push to the &lt;code&gt;master&lt;/code&gt; branch. So it would be much better for you to be the only person with write access. To make life simpler, I would recommend you use &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/07/24/rultor-automated-merging.html&quot;&gt;Rultor&lt;/a&gt; as a tool for merging those pull requests semi-automatically.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Don't rely on reports, promises, guarantees, and extensive documentation&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Regularly Collect Metrics&lt;/strong&gt;. Ask your outsourcing team members to regularly collect metrics from the software they create and send you them somehow (by email, maybe). I would recommend using &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/11/14/hits-of-code.html&quot;&gt;Hits-of-Code&lt;/a&gt;, unit test coverage (or just the total number of unit tests), tickets opened and closed, and build duration. I’m talking here about process metrics. This is not what you’re already getting from NewRelic. These metrics will measure the performance of the team, not of the product under development. I’m not saying you should manage the team by the metrics, but you have to keep an eye on these numbers and their dynamics.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conduct Independent Technical Reviews&lt;/strong&gt;. I wrote about these already in my &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/12/18/independent-technical-reviews.html&quot;&gt;You Do Need Independent Technical Reviews!&lt;/a&gt; post a few months ago. The importance of such reviews is difficult to overrate. In software outsourcing, they are especially crucial. Actually, this is the best and likely only way of collecting objective information about the software you’re getting from the outsourcer. Don’t rely on reports, promises, guarantees, and extensive documentation. Instead, &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/06/21/how-to-hire-programmer.html&quot;&gt;hire&lt;/a&gt; someone else on an hourly basis and ask that person to review what your outsourcing partner is developing. Do such reviews regularly and systematically. Don’t be afraid to offend your programmers. Honestly explain the reviewer’s concerns to them. If they are professionals, they will understand and respect your business objectives. You can also show them this article :)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Automate and Control Deployment&lt;/strong&gt;. Ask your &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/10/27/outsourcing-doesnt-work.html&quot;&gt;outsourcing team&lt;/a&gt; to automate the entire deployment pipeline and keep it under your control. I would recommend you do this during the first days of the project. This means the product should be compiled, tested, packaged, installed, and deployed to a production repository (or server/s) by a single click. Some &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/09/11/deployment-script-vs-rultor.html&quot;&gt;script&lt;/a&gt; should be created to automate this chain of operations. That’s what your outsourcing partner has to create for you. Then, when development starts, every time a new change is made to the repository that has to be deployed to production, the same script has to be executed. What is important here is that you should know how this script works and how to run it. You should be able to build and deploy your product by yourself.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Demand Weekly Releases&lt;/strong&gt;. Don’t wait for the final version. Ask your outsourcing team to release a new version &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/06/08/deadly-sins-software-project.html&quot;&gt;every week&lt;/a&gt;. No matter how intensive the development is and how many features are “in progress,” it’s always possible to package a new version and release it. If the development is really intensive, ask your team to use &lt;a href=&quot;http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/&quot;&gt;GitFlow&lt;/a&gt; or something similar to isolate a stable production branch from development branches. But don’t wait! Make sure you see your software packaged and deployed every single week, no exceptions and no excuses. If your outsourcing team can’t give that to you, start worrying and change something.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;They have to know what will happen to them if they succeed and how much they will suffer if they fail&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hire an Independent CTO&lt;/strong&gt;. This advice is mostly for small companies or individuals who &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/05/21/avoid-software-outsourcing-disaster.html&quot;&gt;outsource&lt;/a&gt; software development and rely on their expertise while staying focused on their own business development. That’s unwise; you should have an independent chief technical officer (CTO) who reports to you and controls how the &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/05/21/avoid-software-outsourcing-disaster.html&quot;&gt;outsourcing team works&lt;/a&gt;. This person must be on a different payment schedule with different goals, terms, and objectives. You should talk to the CTO and the CTO should control the offshore team. Very often, business owners try to become software savvy and control the software team directly, learning their software jargon, principles of DevOps, and even Java syntax (I’ve seen that). This is a route to failure. Be smart—you do the business development, the CTO reports to you, and the software team reports to the CTO.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Define Rewards and Punishments&lt;/strong&gt;. There is no &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/09/22/micromanagement.html&quot;&gt;management&lt;/a&gt; without these two key components. You’re not supposed to manage all programmers in the outsourcing shop, but you have to manage the entire shop as a single unit of control. You have to give them some structure of &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/09/24/why-monetary-awards-dont-work.html&quot;&gt;motivation&lt;/a&gt;. They have to know what will happen to them if they succeed and how much they will suffer if they fail. If you don’t make this mechanism explicit, you will deal with an &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/10/13/competition-without-rules.html&quot;&gt;implicit version&lt;/a&gt; of it where your chances of winning are very low. Most people assume the best and the only motivation for a software team is to stay on the project. You’re paying them and that’s enough, right? Wrong. Management can’t be effective when a monthly bank transfer is a reward and its absence is a &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/01/05/how-to-punish-employees.html&quot;&gt;punishment&lt;/a&gt;. It is too coarse-grained; that’s why it’s absolutely ineffective. Find a better and more fine-grained mechanism.

you go for when you want to create a software product but software engineering is not your core competence. It’s a <a href="/2015/10/27/outsourcing-doesnt-work.html">smart business practice</a> being employed by everyone from $1,000 personal website owners to Fortune 100 monsters. And all of them fail, to some extent. Actually, it’s very difficult not to fail. Here is my list of simple hints to everyone who decides to outsource software development (the most important ones are at the bottom). I wish someone would have given it to me 15 years ago.</p><figure class="jb_picture"><img itemprop="image" alt="U Turn (1997) by Oliver Stone" src="/images/2015/06/u-turn.jpg" longdesc="#2e6501cf" /><figcaption id="2e6501cf">U Turn (1997) by Oliver Stone</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Have a “Work for Hire” Agreement</strong>. Make sure <a href="/2015/05/04/how-to-protect-business-idea.html">the contract</a> you have with the <a href="/2015/10/27/outsourcing-doesnt-work.html">software outsourcing team</a> includes something like this: “Parties shall deem all deliverables created by the developer as <em>works made for hire</em> as is defined under the <a href="http://www.copyright.gov/title17/">Copyright Law of the United States</a>.” This is the shortest and easiest definition of “whatever you create for me is mine.” Put this into the contract and the outsourcing company won’t be able to claim that the software it created belongs to it, which happens here and there.</p><p><strong>Own Your Source Code Repository</strong>. Make sure the source code repository is under your control. The best way to do this is to create a private GitHub repository for <a href="https://github.com/pricing">$7 per month</a>. The repository will be visible and accessible only by you and your outsourcing team. Moreover, make sure the team has read-only access and can’t change the code directly except through pull requests. In Git, it’s possible to destroy the entire history with a single “forced” push to the <code>master</code> branch. So it would be much better for you to be the only person with write access. To make life simpler, I would recommend you use <a href="/2014/07/24/rultor-automated-merging.html">Rultor</a> as a tool for merging those pull requests semi-automatically.</p><aside class="quote">Don't rely on reports, promises, guarantees, and extensive documentation</aside><p><strong>Regularly Collect Metrics</strong>. Ask your outsourcing team members to regularly collect metrics from the software they create and send you them somehow (by email, maybe). I would recommend using <a href="/2014/11/14/hits-of-code.html">Hits-of-Code</a>, unit test coverage (or just the total number of unit tests), tickets opened and closed, and build duration. I’m talking here about process metrics. This is not what you’re already getting from NewRelic. These metrics will measure the performance of the team, not of the product under development. I’m not saying you should manage the team by the metrics, but you have to keep an eye on these numbers and their dynamics.</p><p><strong>Conduct Independent Technical Reviews</strong>. I wrote about these already in my <a href="/2014/12/18/independent-technical-reviews.html">You Do Need Independent Technical Reviews!</a> post a few months ago. The importance of such reviews is difficult to overrate. In software outsourcing, they are especially crucial. Actually, this is the best and likely only way of collecting objective information about the software you’re getting from the outsourcer. Don’t rely on reports, promises, guarantees, and extensive documentation. Instead, <a href="/2016/06/21/how-to-hire-programmer.html">hire</a> someone else on an hourly basis and ask that person to review what your outsourcing partner is developing. Do such reviews regularly and systematically. Don’t be afraid to offend your programmers. Honestly explain the reviewer’s concerns to them. If they are professionals, they will understand and respect your business objectives. You can also show them this article :)</p><p><strong>Automate and Control Deployment</strong>. Ask your <a href="/2015/10/27/outsourcing-doesnt-work.html">outsourcing team</a> to automate the entire deployment pipeline and keep it under your control. I would recommend you do this during the first days of the project. This means the product should be compiled, tested, packaged, installed, and deployed to a production repository (or server/s) by a single click. Some <a href="/2014/09/11/deployment-script-vs-rultor.html">script</a> should be created to automate this chain of operations. That’s what your outsourcing partner has to create for you. Then, when development starts, every time a new change is made to the repository that has to be deployed to production, the same script has to be executed. What is important here is that you should know how this script works and how to run it. You should be able to build and deploy your product by yourself.</p><p><strong>Demand Weekly Releases</strong>. Don’t wait for the final version. Ask your outsourcing team to release a new version <a href="/2015/06/08/deadly-sins-software-project.html">every week</a>. No matter how intensive the development is and how many features are “in progress,” it’s always possible to package a new version and release it. If the development is really intensive, ask your team to use <a href="http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/">GitFlow</a> or something similar to isolate a stable production branch from development branches. But don’t wait! Make sure you see your software packaged and deployed every single week, no exceptions and no excuses. If your outsourcing team can’t give that to you, start worrying and change something.</p><aside class="quote">They have to know what will happen to them if they succeed and how much they will suffer if they fail</aside><p><strong>Hire an Independent CTO</strong>.

You’re not supposed to manage all programmers in the outsourcing shop, but you have to manage the entire shop as a single unit of control. You have to give them some structure of <a href="/2014/09/24/why-monetary-awards-dont-work.html">motivation</a>. They have to know what will happen to them if they succeed and how much they will suffer if they fail. If you don’t make this mechanism explicit, you will deal with an <a href="/2015/10/13/competition-without-rules.html">implicit version</a> of it where your chances of winning are very low. Most people assume the best and the only motivation for a software team is to stay on the project. You’re paying them and that’s enough, right? Wrong. Management can’t be effective when a monthly bank transfer is a reward and its absence is a <a href="/2016/01/05/how-to-punish-employees.html">punishment</a>. It is too coarse-grained; that’s why it’s absolutely ineffective. Find a better and more fine-grained mechanism.

My best answer is “&lt;em&gt;I don’t know; it depends.&lt;/em&gt;” Sounds like a strange response for someone who claims he knows what he is doing, doesn’t it? “Here is the 20-page &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/11/10/ten-mistakes-in-specs.html&quot;&gt;specification&lt;/a&gt; that explains all the features of the product; how come you can’t estimate the cost?” I can, but I won’t. Here is why.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;!--more--&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;jb_picture&quot;&gt;&lt;img itemprop=&quot;image&quot; alt=&quot;Interstate 60: Episodes of the Road (2002) by Bob Gale&quot; src=&quot;/images/2015/06/interstate-60.jpg&quot; longdesc=&quot;#e9fa47d8&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption id=&quot;e9fa47d8&quot;&gt;Interstate 60: Episodes of the Road (2002) by Bob Gale&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Let me ask you something else: &lt;em&gt;Why do you need an estimate?&lt;/em&gt; Yes, I mean it—why do you ask me how much it will cost to develop the software for you? I can tell you why.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Because you don’t &lt;a href=&quot;/2017/11/21/trust-pay-lose.html&quot;&gt;trust&lt;/a&gt; me.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Any software, no matter how big or good it is, always needs more and more improvements and bug fixes&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;And obviously you have good reasons for that, simply because we both know that a software product is something that can stay in development forever and never be finished. Look at YouTube, for example. How much do you think it would take to create a website like this, where users are able to upload their videos and then stream them? A few days for a good web developer. Will it stream video? Yes, it will. Will it be ready to compete with YouTube? No, it won’t. Add a few hundred developers to the team, a few years, and a few million dollars, and even then you will be behind YouTube. Simply because it’s a never-ending process. Any software, no matter how big or good it is, always needs more and more improvements and bug fixes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thus, when you ask me how much it will cost to create a system similar to YouTube, according to your specifications, my honest and accurate answer should be: “&lt;em&gt;All of your money, and it won’t be enough.&lt;/em&gt;” Will you sign a contract and &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/10/27/outsourcing-doesnt-work.html&quot;&gt;outsource&lt;/a&gt; the project to me after that answer? No, you won’t. That’s why I have to lie and promise something like “three months and $40,000.” Why would you trust me? If you’re smart enough, you won’t.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;My point is that no matter what I promise you, I will be wrong. Terribly wrong.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What is the solution? What do you do? I totally understand that you do need a number to make your plans and secure the money. You need to choose the right &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/10/27/outsourcing-doesnt-work.html&quot;&gt;software outsourcing&lt;/a&gt; partner, and you need to know what to expect and when, but …&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You’re asking the &lt;em&gt;wrong question&lt;/em&gt;!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This question has only one valid answer, and it’s the answer nobody will ever give you—the development will take forever and will consume all your money. All other answers are simply a lie.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I’m sorry if I’ve delivered bad news to you.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But let’s get back to the original problem: Why are you asking me how much it will take to develop the software if you know it’s a never-ending process and there is basically no limit? Because you want to make sure your $40,000 will be used the right way and will produce the maximum it can produce. To get this assurance from me, you’re asking for an estimate. I’m telling you that your software will be ready for $40K, and you sleep well. Until the moment you realize you’ve been fooled. By your own self.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;The development will take forever and will consume all your money.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;Your concern is perfectly valid. You want to spend no more than $40K, and you want to get a product that will help you achieve your business goals. For example, you want to get into the market and acquire your first few thousand users. In other words, your biggest worry is that your dollars will be turned into the right amount of the right software.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Any software team can consume your $40K, but each team will produce a different &lt;em&gt;amount&lt;/em&gt; of software with different &lt;em&gt;quality&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;My point is that instead of asking how much a software project will cost, you should ask &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/01/19/how-expensive-is-outsourcing.html&quot;&gt;how much software&lt;/a&gt; we can create for each dollar you give us and what quality will it be.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Basically, don’t ask us to estimate how much gas it will take to get to the finish line, because there is no finish line. Instead, ask us how much we charge per gallon and how many gallons we consume per mile.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Different teams use different metrics to measure their results (to be honest, most of them don’t use any). We, at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zerocracy.com&quot;&gt;Zerocracy&lt;/a&gt;, use &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/11/14/hits-of-code.html&quot;&gt;hits of code&lt;/a&gt;, bugs, pull requests, test coverage, and a few other metrics as measurable indicators of &lt;em&gt;quantity and quality&lt;/em&gt;. We know exactly how much software we can produce for each $100 you pay us.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Collect those numbers from other teams and compare them. Also, make sure you can control these numbers during the course of the project. That’s the guarantee you’re looking for. Now you know what you’re buying and how much you’re paying for it. In other words, like I said above, having these numbers in front of you will assure you that your money is producing the maximum &lt;em&gt;amount&lt;/em&gt; of software it can produce, at the highest &lt;em&gt;quality&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The only question left is how you can know you’re buying the &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt; software. In other words, you know how much we charge per gallon and how many gallons we use per mile, but how do you know we’re driving in the right direction and not making too many circles or detours?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There is only one mechanism to guarantee that: regular checkpoints. You should ask us whether we deliver the software in small and regular increments, and whether we allow you to conduct regular &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/12/18/independent-technical-reviews.html&quot;&gt;independent reviews&lt;/a&gt; of our progress. Also, make sure we prioritize our technical goals, use milestones, versionalize releases, publish release notes, etc. Make sure that in the course of our journey, you are able to control the progress and make corrections.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To summarize, this is wrong (because there is no “there”):&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hey driver, how much will it cost to get there?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;And this is right:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hey driver, how much do you charge per mile, and do you have a map?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hope I’ve made my point clear :)&lt;/p&gt; "/> <meta name="twitter:url" property="og:url" content="https://www.yegor256.com/2015/06/02/how-to-estimate-software-cost.html"/> <meta name="telegram:channel"

Look at YouTube, for example. How much do you think it would take to create a website like this, where users are able to upload their videos and then stream them? A few days for a good web developer. Will it stream video? Yes, it will. Will it be ready to compete with YouTube? No, it won’t. Add a few hundred developers to the team, a few years, and a few million dollars, and even then you will be behind YouTube. Simply because it’s a never-ending process. Any software, no matter how big or good it is, always needs more and more improvements and bug fixes.</p><p>Thus, when you ask me how much it will cost to create a system similar to YouTube, according to your specifications, my honest and accurate answer should be: “<em>All of your money, and it won’t be enough.</em>” Will you sign a contract and <a href="/2015/10/27/outsourcing-doesnt-work.html">outsource</a> the project to me after that answer? No, you won’t. That’s why I have to lie and promise something like “three months and $40,000.” Why would you trust me?

First, you find a company that promises you everything you could wish for in a product—on-time and in-budget delivery, highest quality, beautiful user interface, cutting-edge technologies, and hassle-free lifetime support. So you send the first payment and your journey starts. The team hardly understands your needs, the quality is terrible, all your time and budget expectations are severely violated, and the level of &lt;em&gt;frustration&lt;/em&gt; is skyrocketing. And the “best” part is that you can’t get away or else all the money you’ve spent so far will go down the drain and you will have to start from scratch. You have to stay “married” to this team because you can’t afford a “divorce.” Is there a way to do &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/10/27/outsourcing-doesnt-work.html&quot;&gt;software outsourcing&lt;/a&gt; right?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;!--more--&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;jb_picture&quot;&gt;&lt;img itemprop=&quot;image&quot; alt=&quot;The Evil Cult (1993) by Jing Wong&quot; src=&quot;/images/2015/05/evil-cult.jpg&quot; longdesc=&quot;#ebadf4cd&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption id=&quot;ebadf4cd&quot;&gt;The Evil Cult (1993) by Jing Wong&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Yes, it is possible to do it right and truly hassle-free, but you have to be ready to twist your management philosophy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;youtube&quot;&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLk_5BmgTVk&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;box&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DLk_5BmgTVk/mqdefault.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;YouTube video #DLk_5BmgTVk&quot; /&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;play&quot;&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;icon icon-play&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;div&gt;How to Avoid Outsourcing Disaster; 27 May 2017.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;The basic fundamental principle here is that 1) you should openly and frequently communicate your &lt;em&gt;concerns&lt;/em&gt; with the outsourcing team, and 2) they should openly and frequently communicate &lt;em&gt;risks and issues&lt;/em&gt; with you. These are two major success factors in &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/10/27/outsourcing-doesnt-work.html&quot;&gt;software outsourcing&lt;/a&gt; that are very often neglected.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;badge&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/2bQVQI2&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.yegor256.com/images/2015/05/wei-liao-zi-book.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width:96px;max-width:100%;&quot; alt=&quot;badge&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;I learned this principle from &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wei_Liaozi&quot;&gt;Wei Liao Zi&lt;/a&gt;. He said, according to &lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/2bQVQI2&quot;&gt;Military Strategy Classics of Ancient China&lt;/a&gt;, p.239:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;When information from below reaches up high, and the concerns of up high penetrate to below, this is the most ideal situation&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Let me demonstrate a few practical examples of software outsourcing disasters and explain how they can be avoided if you follow said 2,500-year-old principle.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;it-takes-forever-and-im-over-budget&quot;&gt;It Takes Forever and I’m Over Budget!&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s always 95 percent ready, and you always have something that is not implemented or is broken. They’ve done a lot of work, you’ve paid a lot of money, but a market-ready product is not yet there. It takes week after week and month after month; the backlog always has something, and you simply can’t finish this. You’re starting to see this project in your nightmares, and Prozac doesn’t help anymore. How does this sound? Familiar?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Let's forget about these beautiful promises and focus on the ugly reality — you're on your own&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;I hope you do realize that no matter what kind of contract you signed with your software outsourcing partner, how many schedules you’ve baselined, or how many promises were made, they want to keep you as a &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/01/26/happy-boss-false-objective.html&quot;&gt;client&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;forever&lt;/em&gt;. Well, for as long as you have something in your bank account.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You want your business to succeed and flourish, right? They want the same for their business. Your success means a product that is finished and launched to end users. Their success means a never-ending process of writing software for you. These two goals have very little in common. I would even say they contradict each other—when you &lt;em&gt;succeed&lt;/em&gt;, they &lt;em&gt;fail&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Of course, they will tell you they want to finish this product for you and get new contracts in the future. They will say their primary motivation is to make you happy and obtain a good reference. They will assure you that customer satisfaction is more important than money. However, I’m suggesting you be strong enough to face the reality—it’s all &lt;em&gt;lies&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The majority of software outsourcing projects fail. The vast majority (see the latest &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.csus.edu/indiv/v/velianitis/161/ChaosReport.pdf&quot;&gt;CHAOS report&lt;/a&gt;). Software developers realize this better than you, mostly because they see how it happens every day. And your project is not an exception. Thus, let’s forget about these beautiful promises and focus on the ugly reality—you’re on your own.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Keeping in mind the principle I mentioned above, here is my recommendation: Make sure the team understands 1) your real time, &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/06/02/how-to-estimate-software-cost.html&quot;&gt;cost&lt;/a&gt;, and scope constraints, and 2) the consequences of their violation. This is about the first part of the principle—_you should openly and frequently communicate your concerns_. What usually happens is that the outsourcing team remains unaware of a real business situation and only hears “I need this ASAP” every second day.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“ASAP” is not a deadline. Moreover, it’s a very &lt;em&gt;de-motivating&lt;/em&gt; substitute for a realistic milestone. When the team doesn’t know when exactly you need the product, what exactly has to be ready by that date, and &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt;, it starts to work against you. The emphasis here is on “why.” For most business owners, it’s difficult to answer this question.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Why do you need the product to be ready by the first of June? Just because you are sick of waiting? This is not a reasonable answer. You’re sick of it but you still have money in your bank account. They will keep invoicing you, and they won’t respect you. They won’t treat you as a strong and goal-oriented business person. You either aren’t smart enough to identify your time constraints or you’re hiding them from the team. In either case, they won’t appreciate that behavior.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Here is how a properly defined time and cost constraint may sound:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Features A, B, and D must be ready before the first of June, because our marketing campaign starts on the fifth of June. If we don&amp;#39;t have them ready, I will lose $25,000 in marketing costs. If this happens, I will have to cut the monthly development budget in half.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;When the software outsourcing company, your partner, hears this definition of a deadline, it becomes a real partner of yours. Now its goals are &lt;em&gt;aligned&lt;/em&gt; with yours. If the milestone is missed, you will suffer and they understand exactly how. Besides that, they see how your suffering will be transferred to their shoulders too.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;You're losing respect and they're starting to treat you like a cash cow&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;Stop asking them to finish everything ASAP. Stop calling them twice a day and yelling for an hour about their poor performance. Stop using language in business emails. Stop making all this noise. It doesn’t help you anyway. Moreover, it only makes the situation worse, because you’re losing &lt;em&gt;respect&lt;/em&gt; and they’re starting to treat you like a cash cow—a rather stupid and emotional one.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Instead, do your homework and define your &lt;em&gt;realistic&lt;/em&gt; milestones. Think about your real time, scope, and budget limitations. Write them down in very short and concise sentences. Make sure your constraints are realistic and their descriptions answer the main question—_why_.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Why do you need this by the first of June? Why do you want to spend less than $50,000? Why do you need all five features to be in version 1.0? Why do you want your web app to be ready to handle 1K concurrent sessions? Why do you need a mobile app in the first release?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Answer for yourself and make sure your answers are understood by the outsourcing company. Don’t hide this information.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;the-product-is-so-clumsy&quot;&gt;The Product Is So Clumsy&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;You want your web app to look like Pinterest, react fast, be easy to use, and make you proud when you show it to your friends. But the product they created for you is clumsy, slow, and to be honest, &lt;em&gt;ugly&lt;/em&gt;. You’re asking them to do something about it, and they keep giving you promises. The project keeps consuming your money and its budget grows, but the look and feel is not getting any better. It is far from Pinterest, very far. The frustration is growing, and you don’t see any reasonable way out of this. The only advice you’re getting from your friends is to re-do it all from scratch with a new web development team. How does this sound? I bet it’s familiar.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;We encourage project sponsors to be pessimistic and negative about our quality&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;I believe the root cause of this dead-end situation is a &lt;em&gt;fear&lt;/em&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;/2017/01/03/how-much-you-love-conflicts.html&quot;&gt;conflict&lt;/a&gt;. At early stages in the project, you try to do everything you can to keep a good relationship with the outsourcing company and not to offend anyone. You don’t want to control anyone’s work because they may take it as an insult. You don’t want to express your quality concerns because they may de-motivate the team. You just hope they will improve the product in the future, but when the future comes, it’s &lt;em&gt;too late&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Again, keeping the age-old principle in mind, I would recommend that from the first day of the project, you establish a routine procedure of checking their results and expressing your concerns. In our projects at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zerocracy.com&quot;&gt;Zerocracy&lt;/a&gt;, we ask our customers to be present in GitHub, review our releases frequently, and report any inconsistencies found as GitHub issues. We encourage project sponsors to be as &lt;em&gt;pessimistic&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;negative&lt;/em&gt; about our quality from the beginning of the project. We realize this is how we can minimize the risk of a “piled-up frustration.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Try to do the same in your project that is outsourced to an offshore developer. Don’t be afraid to offend them. Iterative and incremental criticism is a much healthier approach than feedback-free peace that ends in war. Find a way to keep your outsourcing team aware of your opinion about its results on a regular basis. Don’t try to be nice to save a project. You’re doing yourself a bad favor. Instead, be open about your concerns. Remember the first part of the principle above—you should openly and frequently communicate your concerns. This is how you stabilize the project and minimize risks.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Also, it’s a very good practice, from time to time, to invite technical reviewers to generate independent opinions about the product under development. Read my other post about this subject: &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/12/18/independent-technical-reviews.html&quot;&gt;You Do Need Independent Technical Reviews!&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;i-cant-rely-on-their-promises&quot;&gt;I Can’t Rely on Their Promises&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;You call them, make plans, declare milestones, define features, set priorities, agree about quality, and then hang up. In a few days, you realize it was a total waste of time. They don’t keep their &lt;em&gt;promises&lt;/em&gt; because there is always something new happening. Someone is sick, some server is broken, some piece of software appears to be mal-functional, some code is no longer working, etc. You call again, express your frustration, make strong accusations, restructure milestones, redefine features, reset priorities, and in a few days start over. Been there, done that? Sound familiar?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;The team is afraid of you, and in order to keep you on board as a paying customer, has to lie to you&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;In my experience, this unpredictability and unreliability of a software outsourcing team is in most cases caused by a project sponsor himself or herself. This happens when you don’t listen to them or they are afraid to tell you the &lt;em&gt;truth&lt;/em&gt;, which is usually the same thing. Some call this “&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hanselman.com/blog/FearDrivenDevelopmentFDD.aspx&quot;&gt;fear-driven development&lt;/a&gt;.” The team is afraid of you, and in order to keep you on board as a paying customer, has to lie to you.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Basically, they are telling you what you want to hear—that the end of the project is close, that currently open bugs are easy to fix, that performance problems are minor, that the quality of the architecture is outstanding, and that the team is very motivated to work with you. When you hear any of the above, question yourself—Do you encourage them to tell the truth? Do you &lt;em&gt;reward&lt;/em&gt; them for bringing you &lt;em&gt;bad&lt;/em&gt; but honest news?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;If you reward your team when they make you happy with good news, you are training them to lie to you&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;Once again citing the fundamental principle mentioned above, I would recommend you make sure your reasoning for awards and punishments is transparent to your &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/10/27/outsourcing-doesnt-work.html&quot;&gt;software outsourcing partner&lt;/a&gt; and is based on project &lt;em&gt;objectives&lt;/em&gt;, not your personal &lt;em&gt;emotions&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/01/26/happy-boss-false-objective.html&quot;&gt;one of my previous posts&lt;/a&gt;, I wrote that a happy customer is a false objective for a software development team. A customer who is promoting this objective is a terrible customer who is doomed to fail the project. If you reward your team when they make you happy with good news, you are training them to lie to you. If you expect them to deliver good news, you are discouraging them from telling you the truth and from doing what is good for the project, not for you personally.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You’re discouraging them from &lt;em&gt;arguing&lt;/em&gt; with you. In other words, you’re throttling the channel of information that is supposed to come to you from the people working for you. You’re &lt;em&gt;isolating&lt;/em&gt; yourself, and the team is starting to work against you, not with you.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Here is a practical recommendation. First, regularly announce your reasonable objectives and constraints, like I explained above. Make sure the team understands your business plans and the “why” reasoning behind them. Second, regularly ask team members about risks and issues. Ask them why they think project objectives may be compromised. Even better, let them document risks regularly and report them back to you. Reward them for being honest in this list of risks.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Try it and you will be surprised by how many interesting things that risk list will contain.&lt;/p&gt; "/> <meta

disaster waiting to happen; we all know that. First, you find a company that promises you everything you could wish for in a product—on-time and in-budget delivery, highest quality, beautiful user interface, cutting-edge technologies, and hassle-free lifetime support. So you send the first payment and your journey starts. The team hardly understands your needs, the quality is terrible, all your time and budget expectations are severely violated, and the level of <em>frustration</em> is skyrocketing. And the “best” part is that you can’t get away or else all the money you’ve spent so far will go down the drain and you will have to start from scratch. You have to stay “married” to this team because you can’t afford a “divorce.” Is there a way to do <a href="/2015/10/27/outsourcing-doesnt-work.html">software outsourcing</a> right?</p><figure class="jb_picture"><img itemprop="image" alt="The Evil Cult (1993) by Jing Wong" src="/images/2015/05/evil-cult.jpg" longdesc="#ebadf4cd" /><figcaption id="ebadf4cd">The Evil Cult (1993) by Jing Wong</figcaption></figure><p>Yes, it is possible to do it right and truly hassle-free, but you have to be ready to twist your management philosophy.</p><aside class="youtube"> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLk_5BmgTVk"><div class="box"> <img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DLk_5BmgTVk/mqdefault.jpg" alt="YouTube video #DLk_5BmgTVk" /><div class="play"><i class="icon icon-play"></i></div></div></a><div>How to Avoid Outsourcing Disaster; 27 May 2017.</div></aside><p>The basic fundamental principle here is that 1) you should openly and frequently communicate your <em>concerns</em> with the outsourcing team, and 2) they should openly and frequently communicate <em>risks and issues</em> with you. These are two major success factors in <a href="/2015/10/27/outsourcing-doesnt-work.html">software outsourcing</a> that are very often neglected.</p><figure class="badge"><a href="http://amzn.to/2bQVQI2"><img src="https://www.yegor256.com/images/2015/05/wei-liao-zi-book.jpg" style="width:96px;max-width:100%;" alt="badge" /></a></figure><p>I learned this principle from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wei_Liaozi">Wei Liao Zi</a>. He said, according to <a href="http://amzn.to/2bQVQI2">Military Strategy Classics of Ancient China</a>, p.239:</p><blockquote><p>When information from below reaches up high, and the concerns of up high penetrate to below, this is the most ideal situation</p></blockquote><p>Let me demonstrate a few practical examples of software outsourcing disasters and explain how they can be avoided if you follow said 2,500-year-old principle.</p><h2 id="it-takes-forever-and-im-over-budget">It Takes Forever and I’m Over Budget!</h2><p>It’s always 95 percent ready, and you always have something that is not implemented or is broken. They’ve done a lot of work, you’ve paid a lot of money, but a market-ready product is not yet there. It takes week after week and month after month; the backlog always has something, and you simply can’t finish this. You’re starting to see this project in your nightmares, and Prozac doesn’t help anymore. How does this sound? Familiar?</p><aside class="quote">Let's forget about these beautiful promises and focus on the ugly reality — you're on your own</aside><p>I hope you do realize that no matter what kind of contract you signed with your software outsourcing partner, how many schedules you’ve baselined, or how many promises were made, they want to keep you as a <a href="/2015/01/26/happy-boss-false-objective.html">client</a> <em>forever</em>. Well, for as long as you have something in your bank account.</p><p>You want your business to succeed and flourish, right? They want the same for their business. Your success means a product that is finished and launched to end users. Their success means a never-ending process of writing software for you. These two goals have very little in common. I would even say they contradict each other—when you <em>succeed</em>, they <em>fail</em>.</p><p>Of course, they will tell you they want to finish this product for you and get new contracts in the future. They will say their primary motivation is to make you happy and obtain a good reference. They will assure you that customer satisfaction is more important than money. However, I’m suggesting you be strong enough to face the reality—it’s all <em>lies</em>.</p><p>The majority of software outsourcing projects fail. The vast majority (see the latest <a href="http://www.csus.edu/indiv/v/velianitis/161/ChaosReport.pdf">CHAOS report</a>). Software developers realize this better than you, mostly because they see how it happens every day. And your project is not an exception. Thus, let’s forget about these beautiful promises and focus on the ugly reality—you’re on your own.</p><p>Keeping in mind the principle I mentioned above, here is my recommendation: Make sure the team understands 1) your real time, <a href="/2015/06/02/how-to-estimate-software-cost.html">cost</a>, and scope constraints, and 2) the consequences of their violation. This is about the first part of the principle—_you should openly and frequently communicate your concerns_. What usually happens is that the outsourcing team remains unaware of a real business situation and only hears “I need this ASAP” every second day.</p><p>“ASAP” is not a deadline. Moreover, it’s a very <em>de-motivating</em> substitute for a realistic milestone. When the team doesn’t know when exactly you need the product, what exactly has to be ready by that date, and <em>why</em>, it starts to work against you. The emphasis here is on “why.” For most business owners, it’s difficult to answer this question.</p><p>Why do you need the product to be ready by the first of June? Just because you are sick of waiting? This is not a reasonable answer. You’re sick of it but you still have money in your bank account. They will keep invoicing you, and they won’t respect you. They won’t treat you as a strong and goal-oriented business person. You either aren’t smart enough to identify your time constraints or you’re hiding them from the team. In either case, they won’t appreciate that behavior.</p><p>Here is how a properly defined time and cost constraint may sound:</p><figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text"><span></span>Features A, B, and D must be ready before
the first of June, because our marketing
campaign starts on the fifth of June. If
we don&#39;t have them ready, I will lose $25,000
in marketing costs. If this happens, I will
have to cut the monthly development budget
in half.</code></pre></figure><p>When the software outsourcing company, your partner, hears this definition of a deadline, it becomes a real partner of yours. Now its goals are <em>aligned</em> with yours. If the milestone is missed, you will suffer and they understand exactly how. Besides that, they see how your suffering will be transferred to their shoulders too.</p><aside class="quote">You're losing respect and they're starting to treat you like a cash cow</aside><p>Stop asking them to finish everything ASAP. Stop calling them twice a day and yelling for an hour about their poor performance. Stop using language in business emails. Stop making all this noise. It doesn’t help you anyway. Moreover, it only makes the situation worse, because you’re losing <em>respect</em> and they’re starting to treat you like a cash cow—a rather stupid and emotional one.</p><p>Instead, do your homework and define your <em>realistic</em> milestones. Think about your real time, scope, and budget limitations. Write them down in very short and concise sentences. Make sure your constraints are realistic and their descriptions answer the main question—_why_.</p><p>Why do you need this by the first of June? Why do you want to spend less than $50,000? Why do you need all five features to be in version 1.0? Why do you want your web app to be ready to handle 1K concurrent sessions? Why do you need a mobile app in the first release?</p><p>Answer for yourself and make sure your answers are understood by the outsourcing company. Don’t hide this information.</p><h2 id="the-product-is-so-clumsy">The Product Is So Clumsy</h2><p>You want your web app to look like Pinterest, react fast, be easy to use, and make you proud when you show it to your friends. But the product they created for you is clumsy, slow, and to be honest, <em>ugly</em>. You’re asking them to do something about it, and they keep giving you promises. The project keeps consuming your money and its budget grows, but the look and feel is not getting any better. It is far from Pinterest, very far. The frustration is growing, and you don’t see any reasonable way out of this. The only advice you’re getting from your friends is to re-do it all from scratch with a new web development team. How does this sound? I bet it’s familiar.</p><aside class="quote">We encourage project sponsors to be pessimistic and negative about our quality</aside><p>I believe the root cause of this dead-end situation is a <em>fear</em> of <a href="/2017/01/03/how-much-you-love-conflicts.html">conflict</a>.

In other words, you’re throttling the channel of information that is supposed to come to you from the people working for you. You’re <em>isolating</em> yourself, and the team is starting to work against you, not with you.</p><p>Here is a practical recommendation. First, regularly announce your reasonable objectives and constraints, like I explained above. Make sure the team understands your business plans and the “why” reasoning behind them. Second, regularly ask team members about risks and issues. Ask them why they think project objectives may be compromised. Even better, let them document risks regularly and report them back to you. Reward them for being honest in this list of risks.</p><p>Try it and you will be surprised by how many interesting things that risk list will contain.</p></p><nav class="buttons notranslate desktop-only"> <a href="http://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://www.yegor256.com/2015/05/21/avoid-software-outsourcing-disaster.html" title="Share on Facebook" class="button" rel="nofollow"> <span class="count count-facebook">0</span> <i class="icon icon-facebook notranslate" aria-hidden="true"></i> </a> <a href="https://twitter.com/share?url=https://www.yegor256.com/2015/05/21/avoid-software-outsourcing-disaster.html&amp;text=How+to+Avoid+a+Software+Outsourcing+Disaster" title="Share on Twitter" class="button" rel="nofollow"> <span class="count count-twitter">0</span> <i class="icon icon-twitter notranslate" aria-hidden="true"></i> </a> <a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=https://www.yegor256.com/2015/05/21/avoid-software-outsourcing-disaster.html" title="Share on Google+" class="button" rel="nofollow"> <span class="count count-googleplus">0</span> <i class="icon icon-googleplus notranslate" aria-hidden="true"></i> </a> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/cws/share?url=https://www.yegor256.com/2015/05/21/avoid-software-outsourcing-disaster.html" title="Share on LinkedIn" class="button" rel="nofollow"> <span class="count count-linkedin">0</span> <i class="icon icon-linkedin notranslate" aria-hidden="true"></i> </a> <a href="http://reddit.com/submit?url=https://www.yegor256.com/2015/05/21/avoid-software-outsourcing-disaster.html%3F2015-20&amp;title=How+to+Avoid+a+Software+Outsourcing+Disaster" title="Share on Reddit" class="button" rel="nofollow"> <span class="count count-reddit">0</span> <i class="icon icon-reddit notranslate" aria-hidden="true"></i> </a> <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/submitlink?u=https://www.yegor256.com/2015/05/21/avoid-software-outsourcing-disaster.html%3F2015-20&amp;t=How+to+Avoid+a+Software+Outsourcing+Disaster" title="Share on Hacker News" class="button" rel="nofollow"> <span class="count count-hackernews">0</span> <i class="icon icon-hackernews notranslate" aria-hidden="true"></i> </a> </nav> </header> <article class="main" itemprop="articleBody"><div ><p>Software outsourcing is a disaster waiting to happen; we all know that. First, you find a company that promises you everything you could wish for in a product—on-time and in-budget delivery, highest quality, beautiful user interface, cutting-edge technologies, and hassle-free lifetime support. So you send the first payment and your journey starts. The team hardly understands your needs, the quality is terrible, all your time and budget expectations are severely violated, and the level of <em>frustration</em> is skyrocketing. And the “best” part is that you can’t get away or else all the money you’ve spent so far will go down the drain and you will have to start from scratch. You have to stay “married” to this team because you can’t afford a “divorce.” Is there a way to do <a href="/2015/10/27/outsourcing-doesnt-work.html">software outsourcing</a> right?</p><figure class="jb_picture"><img itemprop="image" alt="The Evil Cult (1993) by Jing Wong" src="/images/2015/05/evil-cult.jpg" longdesc="#ebadf4cd" /><figcaption id="ebadf4cd">The Evil Cult (1993) by Jing Wong</figcaption></figure><p>Yes, it is possible to do it right and truly hassle-free, but you have to be ready to twist your management philosophy.</p><aside class="youtube"> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLk_5BmgTVk"><div class="box"> <img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DLk_5BmgTVk/mqdefault.jpg" alt="YouTube video #DLk_5BmgTVk" /><div class="play"><i class="icon icon-play"></i></div></div></a><div>How to Avoid Outsourcing Disaster; 27 May 2017.</div></aside><p>The basic fundamental principle here is that 1) you should openly and frequently communicate your <em>concerns</em> with the outsourcing team, and 2) they should openly and frequently communicate <em>risks and issues</em> with you. These are two major success factors in <a href="/2015/10/27/outsourcing-doesnt-work.html">software outsourcing</a> that are very often neglected.</p><figure class="badge"><a href="http://amzn.to/2bQVQI2"><img src="https://www.yegor256.com/images/2015/05/wei-liao-zi-book.jpg" style="width:96px;max-width:100%;" alt="badge" /></a></figure><p>I learned this principle from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wei_Liaozi">Wei Liao Zi</a>. He said, according to <a href="http://amzn.to/2bQVQI2">Military Strategy Classics of Ancient China</a>, p.239:</p><blockquote><p>When information from below reaches up high, and the concerns of up high penetrate to below, this is the most ideal situation</p></blockquote><p>Let me demonstrate a few practical examples of software outsourcing disasters and explain how they can be avoided if you follow said 2,500-year-old principle.</p><h2 id="it-takes-forever-and-im-over-budget">It Takes Forever and I’m Over Budget!</h2><p>It’s always 95 percent ready, and you always have something that is not implemented or is broken. They’ve done a lot of work, you’ve paid a lot of money, but a market-ready product is not yet there. It takes week after week and month after month; the backlog always has something, and you simply can’t finish this. You’re starting to see this project in your nightmares, and Prozac doesn’t help anymore. How does this sound? Familiar?</p><aside class="quote">Let's forget about these beautiful promises and focus on the ugly reality — you're on your own</aside><p>I hope you do realize that no matter what kind of contract you signed with your software outsourcing partner, how many schedules you’ve baselined, or how many promises were made, they want to keep you as a <a href="/2015/01/26/happy-boss-false-objective.html">client</a> <em>forever</em>. Well, for as long as you have something in your bank account.</p><p>You want your business to succeed and flourish, right? They want the same for their business. Your success means a product that is finished and launched to end users. Their success means a never-ending process of writing software for you. These two goals have very little in common. I would even say they contradict each other—when you <em>succeed</em>, they <em>fail</em>.</p><p>Of course, they will tell you they want to finish this product for you and get new contracts in the future. They will say their primary motivation is to make you happy and obtain a good reference. They will assure you that customer satisfaction is more important than money. However, I’m suggesting you be strong enough to face the reality—it’s all <em>lies</em>.</p><p>The majority of software outsourcing projects fail. The vast majority (see the latest <a href="http://www.csus.edu/indiv/v/velianitis/161/ChaosReport.pdf">CHAOS report</a>). Software developers realize this better than you, mostly because they see how it happens every day. And your project is not an exception. Thus, let’s forget about these beautiful promises and focus on the ugly reality—you’re on your own.</p><p>Keeping in mind the principle I mentioned above, here is my recommendation: Make sure the team understands 1) your real time, <a href="/2015/06/02/how-to-estimate-software-cost.html">cost</a>, and scope constraints, and 2) the consequences of their violation. This is about the first part of the principle—_you should openly and frequently communicate your concerns_. What usually happens is that the outsourcing team remains unaware of a real business situation and only hears “I need this ASAP” every second day.</p><p>“ASAP” is not a deadline. Moreover, it’s a very <em>de-motivating</em> substitute for a realistic milestone. When the team doesn’t know when exactly you need the product, what exactly has to be ready by that date, and <em>why</em>, it starts to work against you. The emphasis here is on “why.” For most business owners, it’s difficult to answer this question.</p><p>Why do you need the product to be ready by the first of June? Just because you are sick of waiting? This is not a reasonable answer. You’re sick of it but you still have money in your bank account. They will keep invoicing you, and they won’t respect you. They won’t treat you as a strong and goal-oriented business person. You either aren’t smart enough to identify your time constraints or you’re hiding them from the team. In either case, they won’t appreciate that behavior.</p><p>Here is how a properly defined time and cost constraint may sound:</p><figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text"><span></span>Features A, B, and D must be ready before
the first of June, because our marketing
campaign starts on the fifth of June. If
we don&#39;t have them ready, I will lose $25,000
in marketing costs. If this happens, I will
have to cut the monthly development budget
in half.</code></pre></figure><p>When the software outsourcing company, your partner, hears this definition of a deadline, it becomes a real partner of yours. Now its goals are <em>aligned</em> with yours. If the milestone is missed, you will suffer and they understand exactly how. Besides that, they see how your suffering will be transferred to their shoulders too.</p><aside class="quote">You're losing respect and they're starting to treat you like a cash cow</aside><p>Stop asking them to finish everything ASAP. Stop calling them twice a day and yelling for an hour about their poor performance. Stop using language in business emails. Stop making all this noise. It doesn’t help you anyway. Moreover, it only makes the situation worse, because you’re losing <em>respect</em> and they’re starting to treat you like a cash cow—a rather stupid and emotional one.</p><p>Instead, do your homework and define your <em>realistic</em> milestones. Think about your real time, scope, and budget limitations. Write them down in very short and concise sentences. Make sure your constraints are realistic and their descriptions answer the main question—_why_.</p><p>Why do you need this by the first of June? Why do you want to spend less than $50,000? Why do you need all five features to be in version 1.0? Why do you want your web app to be ready to handle 1K concurrent sessions? Why do you need a mobile app in the first release?</p><p>Answer for yourself and make sure your answers are understood by the outsourcing company. Don’t hide this information.</p><h2 id="the-product-is-so-clumsy">The Product Is So Clumsy</h2><p>You want your web app to look like Pinterest, react fast, be easy to use, and make you proud when you show it to your friends. But the product they created for you is clumsy, slow, and to be honest, <em>ugly</em>. You’re asking them to do something about it, and they keep giving you promises. The project keeps consuming your money and its budget grows, but the look and feel is not getting any better. It is far from Pinterest, very far. The frustration is growing, and you don’t see any reasonable way out of this. The only advice you’re getting from your friends is to re-do it all from scratch with a new web development team. How does this sound? I bet it’s familiar.</p><aside class="quote">We encourage project sponsors to be pessimistic and negative about our quality</aside><p>I believe the root cause of this dead-end situation is a <em>fear</em> of <a href="/2017/01/03/how-much-you-love-conflicts.html">conflict</a>. At early stages in the project, you try to do everything you can to keep a good relationship with the outsourcing company and not to offend anyone. You don’t want to control anyone’s work because they may take it as an insult. You don’t want to express your quality concerns because they may de-motivate the team. You just hope they will improve the product in the future, but when the future comes, it’s <em>too late</em>.</p><p>Again, keeping the age-old principle in mind, I would recommend that from the first day of the project, you establish a routine procedure of checking their results and expressing your concerns. In our projects at <a href="https://www.zerocracy.com">Zerocracy</a>, we ask our customers to be present in GitHub, review our releases frequently, and report any inconsistencies found as GitHub issues. We encourage project sponsors to be as <em>pessimistic</em> and <em>negative</em> about our quality from the beginning of the project. We realize this is how we can minimize the risk of a “piled-up frustration.”</p><p>Try to do the same in your project that is outsourced to an offshore developer. Don’t be afraid to offend them. Iterative and incremental criticism is a much healthier approach than feedback-free peace that ends in war. Find a way to keep your outsourcing team aware of your opinion about its results on a regular basis. Don’t try to be nice to save a project. You’re doing yourself a bad favor. Instead, be open about your concerns. Remember the first part of the principle above—you should openly and frequently communicate your concerns. This is how you stabilize the project and minimize risks.</p><p>Also, it’s a very good practice, from time to time, to invite technical reviewers to generate independent opinions about the product under development. Read my other post about this subject: <a href="/2014/12/18/independent-technical-reviews.html">You Do Need Independent Technical Reviews!</a>.</p><h2 id="i-cant-rely-on-their-promises">I Can’t Rely on Their Promises</h2><p>You call them, make plans, declare milestones, define features, set priorities, agree about quality, and then hang up. In a few days, you realize it was a total waste of time. They don’t keep their <em>promises</em> because there is always something new happening. Someone is sick, some server is broken, some piece of software appears to be mal-functional, some code is no longer working, etc. You call again, express your frustration, make strong accusations, restructure milestones, redefine features, reset priorities, and in a few days start over. Been there, done that? Sound familiar?</p><aside class="quote">The team is afraid of you, and in order to keep you on board as a paying customer, has to lie to you</aside><p>In my experience, this unpredictability and unreliability of a software outsourcing team is in most cases caused by a project sponsor himself or herself. This happens when you don’t listen to them or they are afraid to tell you the <em>truth</em>, which is usually the same thing. Some call this “<a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/FearDrivenDevelopmentFDD.aspx">fear-driven development</a>.” The team is afraid of you, and in order to keep you on board as a paying customer, has to lie to you.</p><p>Basically, they are telling you what you want to hear—that the end of the project is close, that currently open bugs are easy to fix, that performance problems are minor, that the quality of the architecture is outstanding, and that the team is very motivated to work with you. When you hear any of the above, question yourself—Do you encourage them to tell the truth? Do you <em>reward</em> them for bringing you <em>bad</em> but honest news?</p><aside class="quote">If you reward your team when they make you happy with good news, you are training them to lie to you</aside><p>Once again citing the fundamental principle mentioned above, I would recommend you make sure your reasoning for awards and punishments is transparent to your <a href="/2015/10/27/outsourcing-doesnt-work.html">software outsourcing partner</a> and is based on project <em>objectives</em>, not your personal <em>emotions</em>.</p><p>In <a href="/2015/01/26/happy-boss-false-objective.html">one of my previous posts</a>, I wrote that a happy customer is a false objective for a software development team. A customer who is promoting this objective is a terrible customer who is doomed to fail the project. If you reward your team when they make you happy with good news, you are training them to lie to you. If you expect them to deliver good news, you are discouraging them from telling you the truth and from doing what is good for the project, not for you personally.</p><p>You’re discouraging them from <em>arguing</em> with you. In other words, you’re throttling the channel of information that is supposed to come to you from the people working for you. You’re <em>isolating</em> yourself, and the team is starting to work against you, not with you.</p><p>Here is a practical recommendation. First, regularly announce your reasonable objectives and constraints, like I explained above. Make sure the team understands your business plans and the “why” reasoning behind them.

They may implement your idea (or its elements) without you using their own resources. Also, they may disclose it to their friends, and those friends may disclose it even further, until it is eventually implemented by someone you don’t even know. This happens a lot—and everywhere. I’ve been on both sides. Here is my experience and a few recommendations.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;!--more--&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;jb_picture&quot;&gt;&lt;img itemprop=&quot;image&quot; alt=&quot;There Will Be Blood (2007) by Paul Thomas Anderson&quot; src=&quot;/images/2015/05/there-will-be-blood.jpg&quot; longdesc=&quot;#378e1334&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption id=&quot;378e1334&quot;&gt;There Will Be Blood (2007) by Paul Thomas Anderson&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are basically a few levels of protection you can obtain, and they are listed below, from the simplest and least secure to the most expensive and most secure.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Very often, a software team you &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/10/27/outsourcing-doesnt-work.html&quot;&gt;outsource programming&lt;/a&gt; to is located offshore in a developing country where people care about laws much less than in, say, the United States; corruption makes it possible for them to get away with ignoring almost any violation. Let’s not forget this.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We’re not discussing here the risk of losing a product. This also happens very often—your programmers start working for you, you pay them, they show you something, and then things go south. You find yourself in &lt;a href=&quot;/2017/01/03/how-much-you-love-conflicts.html&quot;&gt;conflict&lt;/a&gt; with them, and they don’t deliver you anything; they ask for extra money instead. You end up with nothing or something that is broken and can’t be put on the market. This is yet another risk, which I’ll try to describe in another article soon.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In this article, we’re talking specifically about a situation where your programmers are using your idea to implement something similar on their own. Let’s say you want to create a new search engine that would be smarter and more accurate than Google. You disclose your algorithms to a group of talented programmers and they just implement it on their own. You already gave them a multi-billion-dollar idea; why would they work for you on the payroll if they can create their own startup? This is the question you, as a savvy entrepreneur, must be prepared to answer for yourself.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;By the way, I’m not a lawyer; I’m speaking here from practical experience only.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;non-disclosure-agreement-nda&quot;&gt;Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA)&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The first and easiest step is a so-called NDA. Here is a very simple and useful example of one, from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/sample-confidentiality-agreement-nda-33343.html&quot;&gt;NOLO&lt;/a&gt;. You put the name of your programmers into the document and ask them to sign it. They won’t object, and you get a piece of paper with a signature; what’s next?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If I’m a programmer, the document basically states that whatever you disclose to me, I should keep in secret and never “use for my own benefit, publish, copy, or otherwise disclose to others.” If you then give me your Google-killer idea and I create my own product using its key principles, what will be your next steps?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In a court of law in your country, you will have to prove that: 1) you disclosed your idea to me, 2) I used it to create the product, 3) I didn’t know about this idea beforehand, and 4) I didn’t invent it myself. Until all of these criteria are proven, I’m innocent and &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; product is online, working and attracting customers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Will you be able to prove that you disclosed the idea to me? Probably, if you sent me some documents. If you discussed it with me over the phone, you won’t prove anything.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Will you be able to prove that your exact idea was used in my product? How will it technically be possible if I don’t disclose the source code?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Can you prove that I didn’t know about something similar before meeting you? Or maybe I was thinking about it on my own. Or I read about it somewhere else.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What if I disclose your idea to my friends and they create a product? Will you be able to prove the fact of that disclosure?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are many such questions. My point is that a signed NDA is a very weak protection. It’s more like a lock on the bathroom door—anyone can break it with a kick from their leg, but for those with good manners, it’s a sign that the restroom is occupied.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;non-compete-clause-ncc&quot;&gt;Non-Compete Clause (NCC)&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The next level of protection is an agreement with a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-compete_clause&quot;&gt;Non-Compete Clause&lt;/a&gt;, which explicitly prohibits me from engaging in the business that your idea is about. For example, it may sound like this: “The developer is not allowed to participate in any businesses related to online searching for five years.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Will I sign this agreement? It depends. But if I show any reluctance in signing it, you should think twice about my real intentions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Will this NCC protect you if I disclose your idea to my friends and they implement it? No, it won’t.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Also, I would recommend you put some explicit liability numbers into the agreement. For example, it may sound like “a minimum penalty for a proven breach of the non-compete clause is $50,000.” In my experience, such explicit statements make contracts much more valuable and help prevent them from being violated.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;copyright&quot;&gt;Copyright&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Copyright is where the government starts to protect you, but you have to pay us for it (by “us” I mean all of us, the society). Well, at least in the United States. In the United Kingdom, it’s free, for example.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the U.S., you go to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.copyright.gov&quot;&gt;copyright.gov&lt;/a&gt;, click “register a copyright,” fill in an online form, post the description of your business idea in a plain text file, pay $35, and you’re done. In a few months, you will receive a confirmation that your “record” is registered.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What does it give you? In a court of law, you can claim that this idea came to your mind on that specific date. Everyone who later made something similar &lt;em&gt;probably&lt;/em&gt; stole it from you, including me, your programmer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Will you be able to prove that my product is actually based on your idea and steals it? Maybe.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s not a very strong protection either, but I would recommend you do it together with an NDA and NCC.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;patent&quot;&gt;Patent&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;A patent is the best you can get to protect your idea. A patent is basically a guarantee of safety that you buy from the government. To get that guarantee, you have to do three things: 1) explain what exactly will be protected, 2) prove that it doesn’t belong to someone else, and 3) pay your dues regularly. It’s very similar to what gangsters do when they “protect” you, but here we’re dealing with intellectual property and there is only one “gangster” per country :) The concept is pretty much the same.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;badge&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/2c5oky8&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.yegor256.com/images/2015/04/nolo-patent-it-yourself.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width:96px;max-width:100%;&quot; alt=&quot;badge&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;First, you describe your idea in the format that patents are written. It is not difficult at all, but it would help if you read one of those “how to file a patent” books. I recommend &lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/2c5oky8&quot;&gt;Patent It Yourself: Your Step-by-Step Guide to Filing at the U.S. Patent Office&lt;/a&gt; by David Pressman and Thomas J. Tuytschaevers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Your application will likely amount to about 10 pages and should take a few days of your time if you know your idea well. No need to hire any attorneys; that’s a waste of money.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Then you should do some research to make sure something similar already exists—but not exactly the same. For example, you can find Google patents for searching algorithms and mention them in your patent in the list of references.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Finally, you pay $425 (if you’re a small company) and submit it to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.uspto.gov&quot;&gt;USPTO&lt;/a&gt;. There is also an option to file a “provisional” patent, but I would recommend you not do this, as it’s just an extra hassle. Simply file a normal one.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Once you’ve paid, your protection starts immediately. If I create a product that uses the idea described in your patent, you can bring me to court and ask me to share my profit with you. You will claim that I was making money by using your brilliant idea, and now it’s time to share that success. Legally speaking, you will accuse me of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patent_infringement&quot;&gt;patent infringement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;First, I will try to invalidate your patent, claiming that something similar already existed before you filed a patent, called &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prior_art&quot;&gt;prior art&lt;/a&gt;. If I succeed, the USPTO will invalidate your patent without a refund, and I’ll walk away, paying you nothing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If I fail, I’ll try to prove that I didn’t infringe on your patent. I will say that my product is not using your ideas but rather is designed with something else in mind, just like Samsung &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc._v._Samsung_Electronics_Co.&quot;&gt;did&lt;/a&gt;. Maybe I’ll win, but my chances will be low.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;By the way, in a few years, you will receive a patent from the USPTO and put it on the shelf. You will then have to pay $480 more. Also, at the end of three years, you will have to pay $800 just to keep your guarantee alive. That escalates to $1,800 in seven years and $3,700 in 11 years (see the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.uspto.gov/learning-and-resources/fees-and-payment/uspto-fee-schedule&quot;&gt;fee schedule&lt;/a&gt;). Told you; just like gangsters :)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To summarize, getting a patent is the best instrument available at the moment in developed countries that can protect your business idea. However, as Apple vs. Samsung &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc._v._Samsung_Electronics_Co.&quot;&gt;lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; demonstrates, it is not a 100 percent guarantee either.&lt;/p&gt; "/> <meta name="twitter:url" property="og:url" content="https://www.yegor256.com/2015/05/04/how-to-protect-business-idea.html"/> <meta name="telegram:channel"

team of programmers to implement your business idea, there is a significant risk of theft and accidental loss. They may implement your idea (or its elements) without you using their own resources. Also, they may disclose it to their friends, and those friends may disclose it even further, until it is eventually implemented by someone you don’t even know. This happens a lot—and everywhere. I’ve been on both sides. Here is my experience and a few recommendations.</p><figure class="jb_picture"><img itemprop="image" alt="There Will Be Blood (2007) by Paul Thomas Anderson" src="/images/2015/05/there-will-be-blood.jpg" longdesc="#378e1334" /><figcaption id="378e1334">There Will Be Blood (2007) by Paul Thomas Anderson</figcaption></figure><p>There are basically a few levels of protection you can obtain, and they are listed below, from the simplest and least secure to the most expensive and most secure.</p><p>Very often, a software team you <a href="/2015/10/27/outsourcing-doesnt-work.html">outsource programming</a> to is located offshore in a developing country where people care about laws much less than in, say, the United States; corruption makes it possible for them to get away with ignoring almost any violation. Let’s not forget this.</p><p>We’re not discussing here the risk of losing a product. This also happens very often—your programmers start working for you, you pay them, they show you something, and then things go south. You find yourself in <a href="/2017/01/03/how-much-you-love-conflicts.html">conflict</a> with them, and they don’t deliver you anything; they ask for extra money instead. You end up with nothing or something that is broken and can’t be put on the market. This is yet another risk, which I’ll try to describe in another article soon.</p><p>In this article, we’re talking specifically about a situation where your programmers are using your idea to implement something similar on their own. Let’s say you want to create a new search engine that would be smarter and more accurate than Google. You disclose your algorithms to a group of talented programmers and they just implement it on their own. You already gave them a multi-billion-dollar idea; why would they work for you on the payroll if they can create their own startup? This is the question you, as a savvy entrepreneur, must be prepared to answer for yourself.</p><p>By the way, I’m not a lawyer; I’m speaking here from practical experience only.</p><h2 id="non-disclosure-agreement-nda">Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA)</h2><p>The first and easiest step is a so-called NDA. Here is a very simple and useful example of one, from <a href="http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/sample-confidentiality-agreement-nda-33343.html">NOLO</a>. You put the name of your programmers into the document and ask them to sign it. They won’t object, and you get a piece of paper with a signature; what’s next?</p><p>If I’m a programmer, the document basically states that whatever you disclose to me, I should keep in secret and never “use for my own benefit, publish, copy, or otherwise disclose to others.” If you then give me your Google-killer idea and I create my own product using its key principles, what will be your next steps?</p><p>In a court of law in your country, you will have to prove that: 1) you disclosed your idea to me, 2) I used it to create the product, 3) I didn’t know about this idea beforehand, and 4) I didn’t invent it myself. Until all of these criteria are proven, I’m innocent and <em>my</em> product is online, working and attracting customers.</p><p>Will you be able to prove that you disclosed the idea to me? Probably, if you sent me some documents. If you discussed it with me over the phone, you won’t prove anything.</p><p>Will you be able to prove that your exact idea was used in my product? How will it technically be possible if I don’t disclose the source code?</p><p>Can you prove that I didn’t know about something similar before meeting you? Or maybe I was thinking about it on my own. Or I read about it somewhere else.</p><p>What if I disclose your idea to my friends and they create a product? Will you be able to prove the fact of that disclosure?</p><p>There are many such questions. My point is that a signed NDA is a very weak protection. It’s more like a lock on the bathroom door—anyone can break it with a kick from their leg, but for those with good manners, it’s a sign that the restroom is occupied.</p><h2 id="non-compete-clause-ncc">Non-Compete Clause (NCC)</h2><p>The next level of protection is an agreement with a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-compete_clause">Non-Compete Clause</a>, which explicitly prohibits me from engaging in the business that your idea is about. For example, it may sound like this: “The developer is not allowed to participate in any businesses related to online searching for five years.”</p><p>Will I sign this agreement? It depends. But if I show any reluctance in signing it, you should think twice about my real intentions.</p><p>Will this NCC protect you if I disclose your idea to my friends and they implement it? No, it won’t.</p><p>Also, I would recommend you put some explicit liability numbers into the agreement. For example, it may sound like “a minimum penalty for a proven breach of the non-compete clause is $50,000.” In my experience, such explicit statements make contracts much more valuable and help prevent them from being violated.</p><h2 id="copyright">Copyright</h2><p>Copyright is where the government starts to protect you, but you have to pay us for it (by “us” I mean all of us, the society). Well, at least in the United States. In the United Kingdom, it’s free, for example.</p><p>In the U.S., you go to <a href="http://www.copyright.gov">copyright.gov</a>, click “register a copyright,” fill in an online form, post the description of your business idea in a plain text file, pay $35, and you’re done. In a few months, you will receive a confirmation that your “record” is registered.</p><p>What does it give you? In a court of law, you can claim that this idea came to your mind on that specific date. Everyone who later made something similar <em>probably</em> stole it from you, including me, your programmer.</p><p>Will you be able to prove that my product is actually based on your idea and steals it? Maybe.</p><p>It’s not a very strong protection either, but I would recommend you do it together with an NDA and NCC.</p><h2 id="patent">Patent</h2><p>A patent is the best you can get to protect your idea.

Let’s say you want to create a new search engine that would be smarter and more accurate than Google. You disclose your algorithms to a group of talented programmers and they just implement it on their own. You already gave them a multi-billion-dollar idea; why would they work for you on the payroll if they can create their own startup? This is the question you, as a savvy entrepreneur, must be prepared to answer for yourself.</p><p>By the way, I’m not a lawyer; I’m speaking here from practical experience only.</p><h2 id="non-disclosure-agreement-nda">Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA)</h2><p>The first and easiest step is a so-called NDA. Here is a very simple and useful example of one, from <a href="http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/sample-confidentiality-agreement-nda-33343.html">NOLO</a>. You put the name of your programmers into the document and ask them to sign it. They won’t object, and you get a piece of paper with a signature; what’s next?</p><p>If I’m a programmer, the document basically states that whatever you disclose to me, I should keep in secret and never “use for my own benefit, publish, copy, or otherwise disclose to others.” If you then give me your Google-killer idea and I create my own product using its key principles, what will be your next steps?</p><p>In a court of law in your country, you will have to prove that: 1) you disclosed your idea to me, 2) I used it to create the product, 3) I didn’t know about this idea beforehand, and 4) I didn’t invent it myself. Until all of these criteria are proven, I’m innocent and <em>my</em> product is online, working and attracting customers.</p><p>Will you be able to prove that you disclosed the idea to me? Probably, if you sent me some documents. If you discussed it with me over the phone, you won’t prove anything.</p><p>Will you be able to prove that your exact idea was used in my product? How will it technically be possible if I don’t disclose the source code?</p><p>Can you prove that I didn’t know about something similar before meeting you? Or maybe I was thinking about it on my own. Or I read about it somewhere else.</p><p>What if I disclose your idea to my friends and they create a product? Will you be able to prove the fact of that disclosure?</p><p>There are many such questions. My point is that a signed NDA is a very weak protection. It’s more like a lock on the bathroom door—anyone can break it with a kick from their leg, but for those with good manners, it’s a sign that the restroom is occupied.</p><h2 id="non-compete-clause-ncc">Non-Compete Clause (NCC)</h2><p>The next level of protection is an agreement with a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-compete_clause">Non-Compete Clause</a>, which explicitly prohibits me from engaging in the business that your idea is about. For example, it may sound like this: “The developer is not allowed to participate in any businesses related to online searching for five years.”</p><p>Will I sign this agreement? It depends. But if I show any reluctance in signing it, you should think twice about my real intentions.</p><p>Will this NCC protect you if I disclose your idea to my friends and they implement it? No, it won’t.</p><p>Also, I would recommend you put some explicit liability numbers into the agreement. For example, it may sound like “a minimum penalty for a proven breach of the non-compete clause is $50,000.” In my experience, such explicit statements make contracts much more valuable and help prevent them from being violated.</p><h2 id="copyright">Copyright</h2><p>Copyright is where the government starts to protect you, but you have to pay us for it (by “us” I mean all of us, the society). Well, at least in the United States. In the United Kingdom, it’s free, for example.</p><p>In the U.S., you go to <a href="http://www.copyright.gov">copyright.gov</a>, click “register a copyright,” fill in an online form, post the description of your business idea in a plain text file, pay $35, and you’re done. In a few months, you will receive a confirmation that your “record” is registered.</p><p>What does it give you? In a court of law, you can claim that this idea came to your mind on that specific date. Everyone who later made something similar <em>probably</em> stole it from you, including me, your programmer.</p><p>Will you be able to prove that my product is actually based on your idea and steals it? Maybe.</p><p>It’s not a very strong protection either, but I would recommend you do it together with an NDA and NCC.</p><h2 id="patent">Patent</h2><p>A patent is the best you can get to protect your idea. A patent is basically a guarantee of safety that you buy from the government. To get that guarantee, you have to do three things: 1) explain what exactly will be protected, 2) prove that it doesn’t belong to someone else, and 3) pay your dues regularly. It’s very similar to what gangsters do when they “protect” you, but here we’re dealing with intellectual property and there is only one “gangster” per country :) The concept is pretty much the same.</p><figure class="badge"><a href="http://amzn.to/2c5oky8"><img src="https://www.yegor256.com/images/2015/04/nolo-patent-it-yourself.jpg" style="width:96px;max-width:100%;" alt="badge" /></a></figure><p>First, you describe your idea in the format that patents are written. It is not difficult at all, but it would help if you read one of those “how to file a patent” books. I recommend <a href="http://amzn.to/2c5oky8">Patent It Yourself: Your Step-by-Step Guide to Filing at the U.S. Patent Office</a> by David Pressman and Thomas J. Tuytschaevers.</p><p>Your application will likely amount to about 10 pages and should take a few days of your time if you know your idea well. No need to hire any attorneys; that’s a waste of money.</p><p>Then you should do some research to make sure something similar already exists—but not exactly the same. For example, you can find Google patents for searching algorithms and mention them in your patent in the list of references.</p><p>Finally, you pay $425 (if you’re a small company) and submit it to the <a href="http://www.uspto.gov">USPTO</a>. There is also an option to file a “provisional” patent, but I would recommend you not do this, as it’s just an extra hassle. Simply file a normal one.</p><p>Once you’ve paid, your protection starts immediately. If I create a product that uses the idea described in your patent, you can bring me to court and ask me to share my profit with you. You will claim that I was making money by using your brilliant idea, and now it’s time to share that success. Legally speaking, you will accuse me of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patent_infringement">patent infringement</a>.</p><p>First, I will try to invalidate your patent, claiming that something similar already existed before you filed a patent, called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prior_art">prior art</a>. If I succeed, the USPTO will invalidate your patent without a refund, and I’ll walk away, paying you nothing.</p><p>If I fail, I’ll try to prove that I didn’t infringe on your patent. I will say that my product is not using your ideas but rather is designed with something else in mind, just like Samsung <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc._v._Samsung_Electronics_Co.">did</a>. Maybe I’ll win, but my chances will be low.</p><p>By the way, in a few years, you will receive a patent from the USPTO and put it on the shelf. You will then have to pay $480 more. Also, at the end of three years, you will have to pay $800 just to keep your guarantee alive. That escalates to $1,800 in seven years and $3,700 in 11 years (see the <a href="http://www.uspto.gov/learning-and-resources/fees-and-payment/uspto-fee-schedule">fee schedule</a>). Told you; just like gangsters :)</p><p>To summarize, getting a patent is the best instrument available at the moment in developed countries that can protect your business idea. However, as Apple vs. Samsung <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc._v._Samsung_Electronics_Co.">lawsuit</a> demonstrates, it is not a 100 percent guarantee either.</p></div></article></div><div class="wrapper"> <related-posts /></div><div class="disqus" role="complementary"><p class="disqus_hint"> Please, use <a href="https://help.disqus.com/commenting/what-html-tags-are-allowed-within-comments">syntax highlighting</a> in your comments, to make them more readable.</p><div id="disqus_thread" class="disqus-thread"> <a>&nbsp;</a></div><script> var disqus_config = function () { this.page.url = document.location.href.split('?')[0].split('#')[0].replace('https://', 'http://');
