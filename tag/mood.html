He said that he needed a partner, to help him partially finance the project, promote it, bring in new ideas, and push the business forward. I liked the business idea and wanted to participate. I started to ask questions about our future partnership and attempted to draw a simple partnership agreement. He quickly got offended. He said that he was looking for a <em>real</em> partner, who would share his goals and would never require any papers or lawyers.</p><figure class='jb_picture'><img itemprop='image' alt='Lola rennt (1998) by Tom Tykwer' src='/images/2018/08/run-lola-run.jpg' longdesc='#8ad64182'/><figcaption id='8ad64182'>Lola rennt (1998) by Tom Tykwer</figcaption></figure><p>Here is a list of the questions I asked him:</p><ul> <li>What happens with my shares if I stop working?</li> <li>Can I start a similar business with another partner later?</li> <li>Who will have a checkbook and bank account access?</li> <li>Who has final say if we disagree?</li> <li>Do I need your permission to sell my shares to a friend?</li> <li>Will there be any vesting schedule?</li> <li>Who approves expenses?</li> <li>Who controls the domain name registrar account?</li> <li>Who pays if the project needs more money?</li></ul><p>For the majority of people I attempt to do business with, these questions are indeed offensive. They feel like I&#39;m trying to draw a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prenuptial_agreement">prenup</a> between us, while they would prefer our &quot;marriage&quot; to be based solely on love. They would have us promise to never betray each other&#39;s mutual interests but then the business suffers and eventually collapses.</p><p>Why so? Because it&#39;s impossible to be equal in business (just like it&#39;s impossible to be equal in marriage, but that&#39;s a topic for another blog post). Eventually a conflict of interests shows up and the inability to resolve it affects and damages the business. &quot;Co-founder disputes have historically been one of the top reasons startups fail at the earliest possible stage,&quot; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/18/co-founder-conflict/">says</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/garrytan">Garry Tan</a>.</p><p>I would call that type of partnership, which many young startup founders enter into, &quot;70/70.&quot; For them the initial agreement is not a formula of future growth, but a symbol of <em>respect</em>. Each of them wants to be respected and that&#39;s why they demand 70% of the business for themselves. They don&#39;t care and don&#39;t understand how exactly the distribution of assets and profit will work in the future. They don&#39;t foresee forthcoming conflicts and fights, mostly because they are too young or naive (or both). According to the <a href="https://hbr.org/2008/02/the-founders-dilemma">The Founder&#39;s Dilemma</a> by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noam_T._Wasserman">Noam Wasserman</a>, &quot;Founders&#39; attachment, overconfidence, and naïveté may be necessary to get new ventures up and running, but these emotions later create problems.&quot;</p><p>They just want to have 70%... each!!!</p><p>It&#39;s not even 50/50 in most cases, but 70/70. This is what makes it funny. Very often each partner thinks that he or she is the major contributor to the project and that&#39;s why it&#39;s 70%.</p><p>And they have it.</p><p>When I was younger, I had no problem with entering into such an agreement. I was saying to myself: he wants 70% but he doesn&#39;t understand that in reality he won&#39;t even get a single percent, since, for example, we didn&#39;t put the ownership of the domain name into the contract. It is obvious right from the start that the partner is ready to trust me blindly, without even thinking about possible consequences. In the end, all of us, and our startups, were losing.</p><p>Don&#39;t get me wrong, trust between partners is a crucial and mandatory element of any deal. But you can&#39;t trust me to stand by my words, if there were <em>no words</em>. If we never discussed, for example, how much I get when I quit because I&#39;m fed up with you, I will try to get as much as possible and where exactly that line of 70% goes will be a subject for an ugly debate. And this will happen in very different circumstances, where there will be, most probably, no love between us or maybe even friendship. In that future fight the one who is the most aggressive and cunning will win. Do you really want that to be me? Or do you expect it to be you?</p><p>Now I&#39;m a bit older and more experienced. I&#39;ve seen those ugly debates and don&#39;t want them anymore. I don&#39;t want the investment of my time and my money to go down the drain. I want to know upfront what exactly will happen with them in a month, a year, and a few decades, when I retire and my grandchildren inherit them.</p><p>That&#39;s why I ask all those &quot;offensive&quot; questions upfront. If the other side does indeed get offended, I attempt to explain to them what I just said in this article. If they don&#39;t understand and still want to marry me out of love, I walk away. As <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/startupmistakes.html">Paul Graham</a>, a co-founder of Y Combinator, <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/startupmistakes.html">said</a>, &quot;Most of the disputes I&#39;ve seen between founders could have been avoided if they&#39;d been more careful about who they started a company with.&quot; I don&#39;t want to start a business with those who are scared of a prenup. I know that in that case the divorce will be ugly.</p></p><nav class="buttons notranslate desktop-only"> <a href="http://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://www.yegor256.com/2018/08/14/seventy-percent.html" title="Share on Facebook" class="button" rel="nofollow"> <span class="count count-facebook">0</span> <i class="icon icon-facebook notranslate" aria-hidden="true"></i> </a> <a href="https://twitter.com/share?url=https://www.yegor256.com/2018/08/14/seventy-percent.html&amp;text=70%2F70" title="Share on Twitter" class="button" rel="nofollow"> <span class="count count-twitter">0</span> <i class="icon icon-twitter notranslate" aria-hidden="true"></i> </a> <a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=https://www.yegor256.com/2018/08/14/seventy-percent.html" title="Share on Google+" class="button" rel="nofollow"> <span class="count count-googleplus">0</span> <i class="icon icon-googleplus notranslate" aria-hidden="true"></i> </a> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/cws/share?url=https://www.yegor256.com/2018/08/14/seventy-percent.html" title="Share on LinkedIn" class="button" rel="nofollow"> <span class="count count-linkedin">0</span> <i class="icon icon-linkedin notranslate" aria-hidden="true"></i> </a> <a href="http://reddit.com/submit?url=https://www.yegor256.com/2018/08/14/seventy-percent.html%3F2018-32&amp;title=70%2F70" title="Share on Reddit" class="button" rel="nofollow"> <span class="count count-reddit">0</span> <i class="icon icon-reddit notranslate" aria-hidden="true"></i> </a> <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/submitlink?u=https://www.yegor256.com/2018/08/14/seventy-percent.html%3F2018-32&amp;t=70%2F70" title="Share on Hacker News" class="button" rel="nofollow"> <span class="count count-hackernews">0</span> <i class="icon icon-hackernews notranslate" aria-hidden="true"></i> </a> </nav> </header> <article class="main" itemprop="articleBody"><div ><p>A few days ago, a friend of mine asked me to join him in a new startup.

They feel like I&#39;m trying to draw a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prenuptial_agreement">prenup</a> between us, while they would prefer our &quot;marriage&quot; to be based solely on love. They would have us promise to never betray each other&#39;s mutual interests but then the business suffers and eventually collapses.</p><p>Why so? Because it&#39;s impossible to be equal in business (just like it&#39;s impossible to be equal in marriage, but that&#39;s a topic for another blog post). Eventually a conflict of interests shows up and the inability to resolve it affects and damages the business. &quot;Co-founder disputes have historically been one of the top reasons startups fail at the earliest possible stage,&quot; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/18/co-founder-conflict/">says</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/garrytan">Garry Tan</a>.</p><p>I would call that type of partnership, which many young startup founders enter into, &quot;70/70.&quot; For them the initial agreement is not a formula of future growth, but a symbol of <em>respect</em>. Each of them wants to be respected and that&#39;s why they demand 70% of the business for themselves. They don&#39;t care and don&#39;t understand how exactly the distribution of assets and profit will work in the future. They don&#39;t foresee forthcoming conflicts and fights, mostly because they are too young or naive (or both). According to the <a href="https://hbr.org/2008/02/the-founders-dilemma">The Founder&#39;s Dilemma</a> by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noam_T._Wasserman">Noam Wasserman</a>, &quot;Founders&#39; attachment, overconfidence, and naïveté may be necessary to get new ventures up and running, but these emotions later create problems.&quot;</p><p>They just want to have 70%... each!!!</p><p>It&#39;s not even 50/50 in most cases, but 70/70. This is what makes it funny. Very often each partner thinks that he or she is the major contributor to the project and that&#39;s why it&#39;s 70%.</p><p>And they have it.</p><p>When I was younger, I had no problem with entering into such an agreement. I was saying to myself: he wants 70% but he doesn&#39;t understand that in reality he won&#39;t even get a single percent, since, for example, we didn&#39;t put the ownership of the domain name into the contract. It is obvious right from the start that the partner is ready to trust me blindly, without even thinking about possible consequences. In the end, all of us, and our startups, were losing.</p><p>Don&#39;t get me wrong, trust between partners is a crucial and mandatory element of any deal. But you can&#39;t trust me to stand by my words, if there were <em>no words</em>. If we never discussed, for example, how much I get when I quit because I&#39;m fed up with you, I will try to get as much as possible and where exactly that line of 70% goes will be a subject for an ugly debate. And this will happen in very different circumstances, where there will be, most probably, no love between us or maybe even friendship. In that future fight the one who is the most aggressive and cunning will win. Do you really want that to be me? Or do you expect it to be you?</p><p>Now I&#39;m a bit older and more experienced. I&#39;ve seen those ugly debates and don&#39;t want them anymore. I don&#39;t want the investment of my time and my money to go down the drain. I want to know upfront what exactly will happen with them in a month, a year, and a few decades, when I retire and my grandchildren inherit them.</p><p>That&#39;s why I ask all those &quot;offensive&quot; questions upfront. If the other side does indeed get offended, I attempt to explain to them what I just said in this article. If they don&#39;t understand and still want to marry me out of love, I walk away. As <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/startupmistakes.html">Paul Graham</a>, a co-founder of Y Combinator, <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/startupmistakes.html">said</a>, &quot;Most of the disputes I&#39;ve seen between founders could have been avoided if they&#39;d been more careful about who they started a company with.&quot; I don&#39;t want to start a business with those who are scared of a prenup. I know that in that case the divorce will be ugly.</p></div></article></div><div class="wrapper"> <related-posts /></div><div class="disqus" role="complementary"><p class="disqus_hint"> Please, use <a href="https://help.disqus.com/commenting/what-html-tags-are-allowed-within-comments">syntax highlighting</a> in your comments, to make them more readable.</p><div id="disqus_thread" class="disqus-thread"> <a>&nbsp;</a></div><script> var disqus_config = function () { this.page.url = document.location.href.split('?')[0].split('#')[0].replace('https://', 'http://'); this.page.identifier = this.page.url; }; (function() { var d = document, s = d.createElement('script'); s.src = '//yegor256.disqus.com/embed.js'; s.setAttribute('data-timestamp', +new Date()); (d.head || d.body).appendChild(s); })(); </script> <noscript><div><p class="red"> JavaScript is disabled in your browser, that's why you can't see comments under this post.</p></div></noscript></div><div class="wrapper"> <footer class="footer"><p> &copy; <span itemscope="" itemprop="copyrightHolder" itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"> <span itemprop="name">Yegor Bugayenko</span> </span> 2014&ndash;<span itemprop="copyrightYear">2018</span></p></footer></div></section><div class="wrapper unprintable" style="text-align:center;margin-top:2em;"> <a href="http://www.sixnines.io/h/3ba1652f"> <img src="//www.sixnines.io/b/3ba1652f?style=flat" alt="sixnines availability badge"/> </a></div><script src="//code.jquery.com/jquery-1.9.0.min.js"></script> <script src="/js/all.js?40913e1d169"></script> <script>var disqus_shortname = 'yegor256';</script> <script id="dsq-count-scr" src="//yegor256.disqus.com/count.js" async="async"></script> <script> (function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){ (i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o), m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m) })(window,document,'script','//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga'); ga('create', 'UA-1963507-32', 'auto'); ga('send', 'pageview'); </script> <script> Cd=document;Cr="&"+Math.random();Cp="&s=1"; Cd.cookie="b=b";if(Cd.cookie)Cp+="&c=1"; Cp+="&t="+(new Date()).getTimezoneOffset(); if(self!=top)Cp+="&f=1"; </script> <script> if(navigator.javaEnabled())Cp+="&j=1"; </script> <script> if(typeof(screen)!='undefined')Cp+="&w="+screen.width+"&h="+ screen.height+"&d="+(screen.colorDepth?screen.colorDepth:screen.pixelDepth); </script> <script> Cd.write("<img src='//c.hit.ua/hit?i=95870&g=0&x=2"+Cp+Cr+ "&r="+escape(Cd.referrer)+"&u="+escape(window.location.href)+ "' border='0' wi"+"dth='1' he"+"ight='1'/>"); </script> <script type="application/ld+json"> { "@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Person", "name": "Yegor Bugayenko", "url": "http://www.yegor256.com", "sameAs": [ "https://www.facebook.com/yegor256", "https://instagram.com/yegor256", "https://www.linkedin.com/in/yegor256", "https://twitter.com/yegor256", "https://github.com/yegor256", "https://www.pinterest.com/yegor256/" ] } </script> </body> </html> <!DOCTYPE html> <html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/WebSite"> <head> <meta charset="utf-8"/> <meta name="description" content="Sexual harassment has been a hot topic in Silicon Valley in the last few months; what exactly is happening and how will it affect us on a larger scale?

What, for example, did Dave McClure do in order to be kicked out of the company he founded?</p><p>Let&#39;s see. According to Katie Benner from The New York Times, he sent <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/30/technology/women-entrepreneurs-speak-out-sexual-harassment.html">this message</a> to <a href="https://twitter.com/sarahkunst">Sarah Kunst</a>, who was an applicant at his incubator in 2014 (other &quot;harassers&quot; were accused of doing something very similar):</p><blockquote><p>I was getting confused figuring out whether to hire you or hit on you.</p></blockquote><p>Obviously he was flirting. And what&#39;s wrong with that? Can&#39;t we flirt any more? Is it a crime all of a sudden? One thing is wrong though. It was a <em>threat</em>.</p><p>Even though this message didn&#39;t say it explicitly, it actually <em>implied</em> that &quot;you either go along and we go out, or you won&#39;t be hired.&quot; Of course, &quot;no hire&quot; may not hurt as much as a knife or a fist in the face, but it does hurt. Especially if you are a woman, a member of a minority group.</p><p>I&#39;m a <del>sexist</del> <a href="/2017/07/04/sexism.html">gentleman</a>, I feel bad when I see women being threatened. I want to protect them and I expect our system of justice to help me, just like it helps when we deal with physical violence. These threats or attempts to threaten must be punished.</p><p>However!</p><p>There is nothing wrong with the game between the sexes by itself. Just like we don&#39;t prohibit sex because we are afraid of rapists, we must not stop asking women out because of our fear of a possible harassment accusation. However, it seems that this is what is happening now: men are becoming <em>afraid</em> of women. Especially powerful men with money and status. They realize that a small incautious step may help them become the next Dave or Travis.</p><p>This fear is destroying us.</p><p>Thanks to this fear our <em>masculine</em> characteristics become a victim of this dangerous game that society is playing right now, with a noble intent to protect women against verbal and psychological abuse. We men are losing our self-confidence, our self-esteem, our <del>balls</del> courage.</p><p>This fear mentally castrates us.</p><p>We must be absolutely clear that those harassers are guilty not because they &quot;made advances&quot; towards women who work with them or for them, but because they were <em>threatening</em> those ladies. There is nothing wrong in being attracted to a woman, no matter who she is: your boss, your employee, your schoolmate, or the founder of the business you&#39;re investing in. Moreover, there is nothing wrong in making advances, falling in love, having sex and marrying them. Threatening them in order to get all that is very wrong.</p><p>Not every flirtation is harassment. Not every man with a sexual instinct is a rapist.</p><p>How would I re-phrase that message to Sarah if I had been Dave and had fallen in love with her at first sight? I would probably say:</p><blockquote><p>I was getting confused, figuring out how to isolate my hiring process from my desire to hit on you. How about dinner? I promise, no matter how it ends, it will not affect our hiring decision at all.</p></blockquote><p>I realize that it&#39;s not perfect, since she wouldn&#39;t be completely comfortable, and still might expect Dave&#39;s feelings to affect his hiring decision if it turns out she doesn&#39;t like him or simply already has a partner.

Let&#39;s try to put emotions aside and analyze what&#39;s happening and what long-term consequences this panic may have for our male-dominated engineering environment.</p><figure class='jb_picture'><img itemprop='image' alt='Twentynine Palms (2003) by Bruno Dumont' src='/images/2017/07/twentynine-palms.jpg' longdesc='#c014ddd9'/><figcaption id='c014ddd9'>Twentynine Palms (2003) by Bruno Dumont</figcaption></figure><p>We will never know what really happened between those male investors and female entrepreneurs behind closed doors, but the gist of the accusation is that the former were <em>making advances</em> towards the latter, where it was clearly <em>inappropriate</em>.</p><p>What does that mean exactly? What, for example, did Dave McClure do in order to be kicked out of the company he founded?</p><p>Let&#39;s see. According to Katie Benner from The New York Times, he sent <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/30/technology/women-entrepreneurs-speak-out-sexual-harassment.html">this message</a> to <a href="https://twitter.com/sarahkunst">Sarah Kunst</a>, who was an applicant at his incubator in 2014 (other &quot;harassers&quot; were accused of doing something very similar):</p><blockquote><p>I was getting confused figuring out whether to hire you or hit on you.</p></blockquote><p>Obviously he was flirting. And what&#39;s wrong with that? Can&#39;t we flirt any more? Is it a crime all of a sudden? One thing is wrong though. It was a <em>threat</em>.</p><p>Even though this message didn&#39;t say it explicitly, it actually <em>implied</em> that &quot;you either go along and we go out, or you won&#39;t be hired.&quot; Of course, &quot;no hire&quot; may not hurt as much as a knife or a fist in the face, but it does hurt. Especially if you are a woman, a member of a minority group.</p><p>I&#39;m a <del>sexist</del> <a href="/2017/07/04/sexism.html">gentleman</a>, I feel bad when I see women being threatened. I want to protect them and I expect our system of justice to help me, just like it helps when we deal with physical violence. These threats or attempts to threaten must be punished.</p><p>However!</p><p>There is nothing wrong with the game between the sexes by itself. Just like we don&#39;t prohibit sex because we are afraid of rapists, we must not stop asking women out because of our fear of a possible harassment accusation. However, it seems that this is what is happening now: men are becoming <em>afraid</em> of women. Especially powerful men with money and status. They realize that a small incautious step may help them become the next Dave or Travis.</p><p>This fear is destroying us.</p><p>Thanks to this fear our <em>masculine</em> characteristics become a victim of this dangerous game that society is playing right now, with a noble intent to protect women against verbal and psychological abuse. We men are losing our self-confidence, our self-esteem, our <del>balls</del> courage.</p><p>This fear mentally castrates us.</p><p>We must be absolutely clear that those harassers are guilty not because they &quot;made advances&quot; towards women who work with them or for them, but because they were <em>threatening</em> those ladies. There is nothing wrong in being attracted to a woman, no matter who she is: your boss, your employee, your schoolmate, or the founder of the business you&#39;re investing in. Moreover, there is nothing wrong in making advances, falling in love, having sex and marrying them. Threatening them in order to get all that is very wrong.</p><p>Not every flirtation is harassment. Not every man with a sexual instinct is a rapist.</p><p>How would I re-phrase that message to Sarah if I had been Dave and had fallen in love with her at first sight? I would probably say:</p><blockquote><p>I was getting confused, figuring out how to isolate my hiring process from my desire to hit on you. How about dinner? I promise, no matter how it ends, it will not affect our hiring decision at all.</p></blockquote><p>I realize that it&#39;s not perfect, since she wouldn&#39;t be completely comfortable, and still might expect Dave&#39;s feelings to affect his hiring decision if it turns out she doesn&#39;t like him or simply already has a partner. However, this would seem like a respectful attempt to put the weapon down.</p><p>It is difficult to not threaten a woman if you&#39;re holding a gun in your hand while asking her out. Money and power is the gun.</p><p>Guys, let&#39;s be very careful. However, let&#39;s not forget how to seduce women and fall in love with them. We have to stay men, especially when some of those among us are weak abusers deserving no respect.</p></div></article></div><div class="wrapper"> <related-posts /></div><div class="disqus" role="complementary"><p class="disqus_hint"> Please, use <a href="https://help.disqus.com/commenting/what-html-tags-are-allowed-within-comments">syntax highlighting</a> in your comments, to make them more readable.</p><div id="disqus_thread" class="disqus-thread"> <a>&nbsp;</a></div><script> var disqus_config = function () { this.page.url = document.location.href.split('?')[0].split('#')[0].replace('https://', 'http://'); this.page.identifier = this.page.url; }; (function() { var d = document, s = d.createElement('script'); s.src = '//yegor256.disqus.com/embed.js'; s.setAttribute('data-timestamp', +new Date()); (d.head || d.body).appendChild(s); })(); </script> <noscript><div><p class="red"> JavaScript is disabled in your browser, that's why you can't see comments under this post.</p></div></noscript></div><div class="wrapper"> <footer class="footer"><p> &copy; <span itemscope="" itemprop="copyrightHolder" itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"> <span itemprop="name">Yegor Bugayenko</span> </span> 2014&ndash;<span itemprop="copyrightYear">2018</span></p></footer></div></section><div class="wrapper unprintable" style="text-align:center;margin-top:2em;"> <a href="http://www.sixnines.io/h/3ba1652f"> <img src="//www.sixnines.io/b/3ba1652f?style=flat" alt="sixnines availability badge"/> </a></div><script src="//code.jquery.com/jquery-1.9.0.min.js"></script> <script src="/js/all.js?40913e1d169"></script> <script>var disqus_shortname = 'yegor256';</script> <script id="dsq-count-scr" src="//yegor256.disqus.com/count.js" async="async"></script> <script> (function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){ (i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o), m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m) })(window,document,'script','//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga'); ga('create', 'UA-1963507-32', 'auto'); ga('send', 'pageview'); </script> <script> Cd=document;Cr="&"+Math.random();Cp="&s=1"; Cd.cookie="b=b";if(Cd.cookie)Cp+="&c=1"; Cp+="&t="+(new Date()).getTimezoneOffset(); if(self!=top)Cp+="&f=1"; </script> <script> if(navigator.javaEnabled())Cp+="&j=1"; </script> <script> if(typeof(screen)!='undefined')Cp+="&w="+screen.width+"&h="+ screen.height+"&d="+(screen.colorDepth?screen.colorDepth:screen.pixelDepth); </script> <script> Cd.write("<img src='//c.hit.ua/hit?i=95870&g=0&x=2"+Cp+Cr+ "&r="+escape(Cd.referrer)+"&u="+escape(window.location.href)+ "' border='0' wi"+"dth='1' he"+"ight='1'/>"); </script> <script type="application/ld+json"> { "@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Person", "name": "Yegor Bugayenko", "url": "http://www.yegor256.com", "sameAs": [ "https://www.facebook.com/yegor256", "https://instagram.com/yegor256", "https://www.linkedin.com/in/yegor256", "https://twitter.com/yegor256", "https://github.com/yegor256", "https://www.pinterest.com/yegor256/" ] } </script> </body> </html> <!DOCTYPE html> <html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/WebSite"> <head> <meta charset="utf-8"/> <meta name="description" content="Do I respect women who write code for a living?

I believe I owe my readers an explanation. Some of them already got confused and came to me with the question: &quot;If you&#39;re so much against slavery, where is this male chauvinism coming from?&quot; Let me explain what&#39;s going on. Indeed I am a big fan of <a href="/2015/07/21/hourly-pay-modern-slavery.html">freedom</a>, but <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKcWu0tsiZM&t=1s">recent hysteria</a> around <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_equality">gender equality</a> is not helping us to become more free.

That literally meant that I had to treat women with respect and always remember that they were weaker than us men---physically and emotionally.</p><p>I had to open the door for them, I was not allowed to fight with them as I did with my male friends, I was punished for cursing in front of them, and many other things. I did all this not only because of what I was taught, but also because I saw that they indeed were weaker. They were physically and emotionally different from us boys. They played dolls, we played wars. They wore pink and white skirts and blouses, we wore shorts and t-shirts. They cried when someone was offending them and we were supposed to be stronger, never to cry, and to protect them. It was always obvious that we were the troublemakers, but also the protectors, who those little creatures eventually one day would marry.</p><p>Now it seems that I was raised as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexism">sexist</a>. But do I feel ashamed? Not at all.</p><p>Do I believe that gender equality is about making men and women fully equal in all aspects of life? Not at all.</p><p>We must <em>not</em> be equal, because we are different.</p><aside class='quote'>Such inequalities are only making us more human. We need them.</aside><p>There are many other categories of people in modern societies who possess special rights or are not allowed to do certain things. Simply put, they experience <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination">discrimination</a>, <em>but for their good</em>. For example, kids are not allowed to buy alcohol and watch porn. Senior citizens receive pensions even though they don&#39;t work any more. People with disabilities sit in a bus where everybody else is not allowed to. Such <em>inequalities</em> are only making us more human. We need them.</p><p>The same is true for the &quot;category&quot; of people I was taught to respect and protect: women. And no matter what extreme <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feminism">feminists</a> say, I will remain the same. I do believe in inequality between men and women. I want to see us as gentlemen and ladies. Not just genderless people.</p><p>Thanks to this inequality men find women attractive, fall in love with them, marry them and make kids. Thanks to this inequality many years ago my dad asked my mom out, <a href="/2017/07/18/sexual-harassment.html">kissed her</a>, proposed, and brought me into this world.</p><p>Now back to the main problem: women in tech. I&#39;m a programmer myself. I write and debug code every day. I also manage programmers and projects. My 20+ years of experience in coding tells me that this job is not fun most of the time. It&#39;s hard, it requires a lot of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2013/dec/02/men-women-brains-wired-differently">rigid logical thinking</a>, it&#39;s rather boring, and it&#39;s a constant war against machines and against other programmers who produce unmaintainable and unreadable code.</p><aside class='quote'>I also personally don't like the idea of women being police officers, soldiers, surgeons, or firefighters.</aside><p>I don&#39;t feel good about sending women, who I was raised to protect and respect, into this war. I also personally don&#39;t like the idea of women being police officers, soldiers, surgeons, or firefighters, even though it&#39;s not up to me to decide what they do for a living. Those jobs are stressful and dangerous, both physically and emotionally. Not that I believe that women can&#39;t take this stress, I just don&#39;t want them to suffer.

I believe I owe my readers an explanation. Some of them already got confused and came to me with the question: &quot;If you&#39;re so much against slavery, where is this male chauvinism coming from?&quot; Let me explain what&#39;s going on. Indeed I am a big fan of <a href="/2015/07/21/hourly-pay-modern-slavery.html">freedom</a>, but <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKcWu0tsiZM&t=1s">recent hysteria</a> around <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_equality">gender equality</a> is not helping us to become more free. Instead it is causing quite the opposite effect.</p><figure class='jb_picture'><img itemprop='image' alt='Conversations with Other Women (2005) by Hans Canosa' src='/images/2017/07/conversations-with-other-women.jpg' longdesc='#ca72484b'/><figcaption id='ca72484b'>Conversations with Other Women (2005) by Hans Canosa</figcaption></figure><p>When I was a kid my parents and my teachers told me that I had to be a gentleman. That literally meant that I had to treat women with respect and always remember that they were weaker than us men---physically and emotionally.</p><p>I had to open the door for them, I was not allowed to fight with them as I did with my male friends, I was punished for cursing in front of them, and many other things. I did all this not only because of what I was taught, but also because I saw that they indeed were weaker. They were physically and emotionally different from us boys. They played dolls, we played wars. They wore pink and white skirts and blouses, we wore shorts and t-shirts. They cried when someone was offending them and we were supposed to be stronger, never to cry, and to protect them. It was always obvious that we were the troublemakers, but also the protectors, who those little creatures eventually one day would marry.</p><p>Now it seems that I was raised as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexism">sexist</a>. But do I feel ashamed? Not at all.</p><p>Do I believe that gender equality is about making men and women fully equal in all aspects of life? Not at all.</p><p>We must <em>not</em> be equal, because we are different.</p><aside class='quote'>Such inequalities are only making us more human. We need them.</aside><p>There are many other categories of people in modern societies who possess special rights or are not allowed to do certain things. Simply put, they experience <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination">discrimination</a>, <em>but for their good</em>. For example, kids are not allowed to buy alcohol and watch porn. Senior citizens receive pensions even though they don&#39;t work any more. People with disabilities sit in a bus where everybody else is not allowed to. Such <em>inequalities</em> are only making us more human. We need them.</p><p>The same is true for the &quot;category&quot; of people I was taught to respect and protect: women. And no matter what extreme <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feminism">feminists</a> say, I will remain the same. I do believe in inequality between men and women. I want to see us as gentlemen and ladies. Not just genderless people.</p><p>Thanks to this inequality men find women attractive, fall in love with them, marry them and make kids. Thanks to this inequality many years ago my dad asked my mom out, <a href="/2017/07/18/sexual-harassment.html">kissed her</a>, proposed, and brought me into this world.</p><p>Now back to the main problem: women in tech. I&#39;m a programmer myself. I write and debug code every day. I also manage programmers and projects. My 20+ years of experience in coding tells me that this job is not fun most of the time. It&#39;s hard, it requires a lot of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2013/dec/02/men-women-brains-wired-differently">rigid logical thinking</a>, it&#39;s rather boring, and it&#39;s a constant war against machines and against other programmers who produce unmaintainable and unreadable code.</p><aside class='quote'>I also personally don't like the idea of women being police officers, soldiers, surgeons, or firefighters.</aside><p>I don&#39;t feel good about sending women, who I was raised to protect and respect, into this war. I also personally don&#39;t like the idea of women being police officers, soldiers, surgeons, or firefighters, even though it&#39;s not up to me to decide what they do for a living. Those jobs are stressful and dangerous, both physically and emotionally. Not that I believe that women can&#39;t take this stress, I just don&#39;t want them to suffer.

They always start with &quot;We&#39;re so impressed by your profile&quot; and finish with &quot;Let&#39;s schedule an interview.&quot; I always reply with the same text, and they always disappear, only to come back in a few months under a different name.

By my future direct manager.</p></blockquote><p>The recruiter who gets this reply never gets back to me.</p><p>Why do I send this?</p><p>Well, because I learned my lesson two years ago, when Amazon tried to recruit me. I got an email from the company that said they were so impressed by my profile and couldn&#39;t wait to start working with me. They needed me, nobody else. I was naive, and the message did flatter me.</p><aside class='quote'>They paid for my ticket to fly there and a night in a 5-star hotel.

They definitely were interested. So was I.</p><p>What happened at the interview was, most probably, very close to what Max Howell <a href="https://twitter.com/mxcl/status/608682016205344768">experienced</a> <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9695102">with Google</a>: some programmers who didn&#39;t know a thing about my profile asked me to invent some algorithms on a white board for almost four hours. Did I manage? I don&#39;t think so. Did they make me an offer? No.</p><p>What did I learn?</p><p>That it was a waste of time. For both sides.</p><p>Their bureaucratic machine is designed to process hundreds of candidates a month. In order to fish and attract them, there is an army of <del>monkeys</del> <a href="/2015/09/29/mayonnaise.html">recruiters</a> sending warm emails to people like me. They have to screen candidates somehow, and they are too lazy to make this process effective and creative. They just send them through random programmers who are supposed to ask as complex questions as possible.</p><p>I&#39;m not saying that people who pass their tests are not good programmers. I&#39;m also not saying that I&#39;m a good programmer---let&#39;s face it, I didn&#39;t pass the test. I do believe this filtering system is rather good. My point is that it contradicts the original email I got from the recruiter.</p><p>If she would have started her email with &quot;We&#39;re looking for an algorithm expert,&quot; we would never have gotten any further and would not have wasted our time. Clearly, I&#39;m not an expert in algorithms. There is no point in giving me binary-tree-traversing questions; I don&#39;t know those answers and will never be interested in learning them. I&#39;m trying to be an expert in something else, like <a href="/2016/11/29/eolang.html">object-oriented design</a>, for example.</p><aside class='quote'>There is no point in giving me binary-tree-traversing questions; I don't know those answers and will never be interested in learning them.</aside><p>There was a clear mismatch between my profile and the expectations of the interviewers.

I&#39;m getting emails from recruiters at Amazon, Facebook, and smaller Silicon Valley startups. They find me somehow, most likely through this blog, my <a href="/books.html">books</a>, or my <a href="https://github.com/yegor256">GitHub account</a>. They always start with &quot;We&#39;re so impressed by your profile&quot; and finish with &quot;Let&#39;s schedule an interview.&quot; I always reply with the same text, and they always disappear, only to come back in a few months under a different name. Let me explain my reasons; maybe you will do the same and we can change this situation in the industry.</p><figure class='jb_picture'><img itemprop='image' alt='The Deer Hunter (1978) by Michael Cimino' src='/images/2017/02/the-deer-hunter.jpg' longdesc='#ddecf58a'/><figcaption id='ddecf58a'>The Deer Hunter (1978) by Michael Cimino</figcaption></figure><p>Disclaimer: I do realize that these are multi-billion-dollar companies, the best in the industry, and I&#39;m nothing compared to them. I do realize that their recruiters don&#39;t care about my answers---they simply click &quot;delete&quot; and move on. I also realize that they will never see this post, and this article probably won&#39;t change anything.

I&#39;m very interested indeed. I have nothing against an interview. However, there is one condition: I have to be interviewed by the person I will be working for. By my future direct manager.</p></blockquote><p>The recruiter who gets this reply never gets back to me.</p><p>Why do I send this?</p><p>Well, because I learned my lesson two years ago, when Amazon tried to recruit me. I got an email from the company that said they were so impressed by my profile and couldn&#39;t wait to start working with me. They needed me, nobody else. I was naive, and the message did flatter me.</p><aside class='quote'>They paid for my ticket to fly there and a night in a 5-star hotel. I was impressed.</aside><p>We scheduled an interview in the head office in Seattle. They paid for my ticket to fly there (from San Francisco) and a night in a 5-star hotel. I was impressed. They definitely were interested. So was I.</p><p>What happened at the interview was, most probably, very close to what Max Howell <a href="https://twitter.com/mxcl/status/608682016205344768">experienced</a> <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9695102">with Google</a>: some programmers who didn&#39;t know a thing about my profile asked me to invent some algorithms on a white board for almost four hours. Did I manage? I don&#39;t think so. Did they make me an offer? No.</p><p>What did I learn?</p><p>That it was a waste of time. For both sides.</p><p>Their bureaucratic machine is designed to process hundreds of candidates a month. In order to fish and attract them, there is an army of <del>monkeys</del> <a href="/2015/09/29/mayonnaise.html">recruiters</a> sending warm emails to people like me. They have to screen candidates somehow, and they are too lazy to make this process effective and creative. They just send them through random programmers who are supposed to ask as complex questions as possible.</p><p>I&#39;m not saying that people who pass their tests are not good programmers. I&#39;m also not saying that I&#39;m a good programmer---let&#39;s face it, I didn&#39;t pass the test. I do believe this filtering system is rather good. My point is that it contradicts the original email I got from the recruiter.</p><p>If she would have started her email with &quot;We&#39;re looking for an algorithm expert,&quot; we would never have gotten any further and would not have wasted our time. Clearly, I&#39;m not an expert in algorithms. There is no point in giving me binary-tree-traversing questions; I don&#39;t know those answers and will never be interested in learning them.

Unfortunately. They are expensive, <a href="/2018/04/17/how-to-be-lazy.html">lazy</a>, and almost impossible to control. The software they create either works or doesn&#39;t, but you still have to pay them, every month. Of course, it&#39;s always better to pay less. However, sometimes they may figure out they are being underpaid and quit. How do you prevent that? <a href="/2016/01/05/how-to-punish-employees.html">Unfortunately</a>, we can&#39;t use violence any more, but there are some other mechanisms. Let me share.</p><figure class='jb_picture'><img itemprop='image' alt='Ben-Hur (1959) by William Wyler' src='/images/2016/12/ben-hur.jpg' longdesc='#cdad7b09'/><figcaption id='cdad7b09'>Ben-Hur (1959) by William Wyler</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Keep salaries secret</strong>. It&#39;s obvious: Don&#39;t let them discuss <a href="/2015/07/21/hourly-pay-modern-slavery.html">salaries</a>. They must keep this information secret. Warn them or even sign <a href="/2015/05/04/how-to-protect-business-idea.html">NDAs</a> prohibiting any talks about wages, bonuses, compensation plans, etc. They must feel that this information is toxic and never even talk to each other about salaries. If they don&#39;t know how much their coworkers are getting, they won&#39;t raise salary questions for much longer.</p><p><strong>Give raises randomly</strong>. There should be no system behind your salary upgrades or <a href="/2015/09/16/how-to-fire-someone-right.html">firing decisions</a>. You give them raises when you feel like it, not when they are being more productive or effective. Try to make your decisions unpredictable. Unpredictability creates fear, and this is exactly what you need. They will be afraid of you and will not complain about being underpaid for a long time.</p><p><strong>No conferences</strong>. Don&#39;t allow them to attend meetups or conferences. They may meet <a href="/2015/09/29/mayonnaise.html">recruiters</a> there and find out that their salaries are not <a href="/2014/10/29/how-much-do-you-cost.html">fair enough</a>. Promote the idea that conferences are just a waste of time. It&#39;s better to organize events in the <a href="/2016/08/05/distributed-teams-are-higher-quality.html">office</a>. They always have to stay together, never free to meet programmers from other companies. The less they know, the safer you are.</p><p><strong>No work from home</strong>. The office must be their second home. Well, preferably the first one. They must go there every day, have a desk there, a computer, a chair, and a stapler. They will be emotionally attached to the place and it will be very difficult to leave, no matter how underpaid they will be. Never allow them to work <a href="/2016/08/05/distributed-teams-are-higher-quality.html">remotely</a>---they may start thinking about a new home with a bigger salary.</p><p><strong>Spy on them</strong>. Make sure they all use your email server, computers, servers, and even mobile phones. Install software that tracks all their messages. Ideally, you should have a security department watching all of them and regularly informing you about abnormal or suspicious behavior (office cameras will help too). Any contact with other companies should be considered suspicious. Employees must know you&#39;re spying on them. Extra fear is always helpful.</p><aside class='quote'>Brainwash them regularly by communicating how great your company is.</aside><p><strong>Make a deal with competitors</strong>.

Unfortunately. They are expensive, <a href="/2018/04/17/how-to-be-lazy.html">lazy</a>, and almost impossible to control. The software they create either works or doesn&#39;t, but you still have to pay them, every month. Of course, it&#39;s always better to pay less. However, sometimes they may figure out they are being underpaid and quit. How do you prevent that? <a href="/2016/01/05/how-to-punish-employees.html">Unfortunately</a>, we can&#39;t use violence any more, but there are some other mechanisms. Let me share.</p><figure class='jb_picture'><img itemprop='image' alt='Ben-Hur (1959) by William Wyler' src='/images/2016/12/ben-hur.jpg' longdesc='#cdad7b09'/><figcaption id='cdad7b09'>Ben-Hur (1959) by William Wyler</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Keep salaries secret</strong>. It&#39;s obvious: Don&#39;t let them discuss <a href="/2015/07/21/hourly-pay-modern-slavery.html">salaries</a>. They must keep this information secret. Warn them or even sign <a href="/2015/05/04/how-to-protect-business-idea.html">NDAs</a> prohibiting any talks about wages, bonuses, compensation plans, etc. They must feel that this information is toxic and never even talk to each other about salaries. If they don&#39;t know how much their coworkers are getting, they won&#39;t raise salary questions for much longer.</p><p><strong>Give raises randomly</strong>. There should be no system behind your salary upgrades or <a href="/2015/09/16/how-to-fire-someone-right.html">firing decisions</a>. You give them raises when you feel like it, not when they are being more productive or effective. Try to make your decisions unpredictable. Unpredictability creates fear, and this is exactly what you need. They will be afraid of you and will not complain about being underpaid for a long time.</p><p><strong>No conferences</strong>. Don&#39;t allow them to attend meetups or conferences. They may meet <a href="/2015/09/29/mayonnaise.html">recruiters</a> there and find out that their salaries are not <a href="/2014/10/29/how-much-do-you-cost.html">fair enough</a>. Promote the idea that conferences are just a waste of time. It&#39;s better to organize events in the <a href="/2016/08/05/distributed-teams-are-higher-quality.html">office</a>. They always have to stay together, never free to meet programmers from other companies. The less they know, the safer you are.</p><p><strong>No work from home</strong>. The office must be their second home. Well, preferably the first one. They must go there every day, have a desk there, a computer, a chair, and a stapler. They will be emotionally attached to the place and it will be very difficult to leave, no matter how underpaid they will be. Never allow them to work <a href="/2016/08/05/distributed-teams-are-higher-quality.html">remotely</a>---they may start thinking about a new home with a bigger salary.</p><p><strong>Spy on them</strong>. Make sure they all use your email server, computers, servers, and even mobile phones. Install software that tracks all their messages. Ideally, you should have a security department watching all of them and regularly informing you about abnormal or suspicious behavior (office cameras will help too). Any contact with other companies should be considered suspicious. Employees must know you&#39;re spying on them. Extra fear is always helpful.</p><aside class='quote'>Brainwash them regularly by communicating how great your company is.</aside><p><strong>Make a deal with competitors</strong>.

If you don&#39;t use it yet, you absolutely must read <a href="http://amzn.to/2fBsTPn">The TeX Book</a> by Donald Knuth. Even if you&#39;re not going to become a book writer or publisher, you must read the book. You will enjoy reading and will simply fall in love with TeX. The only problem with TeX is that it formats texts for a fixed page size, unlike HTML and many other digital formats. When I write my books, I know exactly the size of their pages, and everything is formatted to look perfect on paper. I simply don&#39;t know how to do the same for all digital formats. I&#39;m sure it&#39;s possible, but I don&#39;t know how.</p><p>Second, there is an emotional reason:</p><p><strong>I don&#39;t like digital books</strong>. Call me old school, but I don&#39;t like to read on screen. I like how books feel, how they smell, and how they become &quot;friends.&quot; I like to make notes, bookmarks, fold pages, etc. I believe what&#39;s very important is not just the content, but the way you &quot;feel&quot; it. With a digital book, this emotional aspect of reading is gone; all books are the same. You don&#39;t feel a book at all, because it&#39;s just a Kindle in your hands. You may say that not everybody is like me. Well, yes, but I want the world to be the way I like it. Not the way it is.</p><p>All other reasons are derived from the fact that a digital book will inevitably be stolen and posted on torrents or somewhere else, for free download. A digital book will become a <em>free</em> book very quickly.</p><aside class='quote'>Let's just agree that a digital book means a free book</aside><p>Let me tell you a funny story. I received an email a few months ago from a &quot;Korean book publisher.&quot; The email said it was very interested in translating <a href="/elegant-objects.html">Elegant Objects</a> into Korean and publishing in its local market. To start the process, the email said, the company needed my book in PDF. I replied that I was ready to send a printed copy, which was definitely enough for a translator to work on. The sender disappeared. I&#39;ve checked its website and found no real evidence of previously published books. I guess it was just a scam, an attempt to get a digital copy of the book. Funny, huh?</p><p>Thus, let&#39;s just agree that a digital book means a free book at the moment of writing, in this world. And here is why I don&#39;t want my books to be free:</p><aside class='quote'>Not only because I'm greedy, but because I want you to take my books seriously</aside><p><strong>I want to earn</strong>. Not only because I need to pay my bills, but mostly because I want to stay motivated. I&#39;ve made almost $12,000 by selling the first volume of <a href="/elegant-objects.html">Elegant Objects</a> over the last 10 months. Do you think I&#39;m motivated enough to write the second volume. Of course I am! Would I be as motivated as I am now if I would have made $500 instead? I don&#39;t think so. Most probably, you would never see any more books from me. And it&#39;s not just about dollars. It&#39;s mostly about the appreciation I feel from you. Every payment I get from Amazon tells me that I definitely deliver something valuable. With a free book, I will get no appreciation and no cash.</p><p><strong>I want you to pay</strong>. Not only because I&#39;m greedy, but mostly because I want you to take my books seriously. As a reader myself, I pay almost no attention to books that cost $1.99 or nothing. I understand that their authors themselves were not serious about them. Why are they cheap or free? They were so easy to write? Their authors don&#39;t believe that anyone would pay any decent money for them? Their authors are afraid of refunds? Probably a combination of all that. I strongly believe that good products must cost good money. If it&#39;s free, it&#39;s bad (or there are some hidden costs or concealed promotion of something else).</p><p>Because of all that, you get no digital books.

They were asking about my opinion of the conferences I&#39;ve recently attended. Basically, they were interested to know what I would suggest for improvement. So, I decided to summarize it in a list of the most typical mistakes all conferences keep making and give them some ideas. Remember, I&#39;m judging from a speaker&#39;s position. The most serious mistakes and pieces of advice are at the bottom.</p><figure class='jb_picture'><img itemprop='image' alt='Mi gran noche (2015) by Álex de la Iglesia' src='/images/2016/06/mi-gran-noche.jpg' longdesc='#02c4598a'/><figcaption id='02c4598a'>Mi gran noche (2015) by Álex de la Iglesia</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Too formal</strong>. Very often all I&#39;m getting from event organizers is a formal email that my presentation was accepted and then some travel details: &quot;your hotel is here, don&#39;t miss this speaker&#39;s dinner.&quot; That&#39;s it. I don&#39;t know who is behind the conference, what this event is for, etc. At that speaker&#39;s dinner (if I don&#39;t miss it) some details are cleared up. At some conferences, they even communicate with me via some online form and I have to answer there through login/logout. This is rather annoying and turns me off. It would be much better to feel that there is a team with real people, who want to see me as a speaker. I would be way more dedicated and motivated.</p><aside class='quote'>Four talks per day is an absolute maximum for a serious listener</aside><p><strong>Short breaks</strong>. Breaks between presentations that are too short give listeners an impression that each particular presentation is not as important as the event as a whole. This really de-motivates me as a speaker. I want to feel valuable. I came to the conference to be heard. I think my speech is the most important and I don&#39;t want people to jump quickly out of the room, just to have enough time to drink coffee and run to the next presentation. 30 minutes between talks is a comfortable time---enough to forget the previous talk and focus on the next one. Also, four talks per day is an absolute maximum for a serious listener.</p><p><strong>No moderator</strong>. There must be someone on the stage who presents the speaker and asks questions if the room is quiet. All academic conferences have that. I don&#39;t understand why most industry events don&#39;t do the same. A speaker must feel comfortable on the stage. Being there alone doesn&#39;t help at all. Also, the moderator will promote me to better engage with the audience.</p><aside class='quote'>I'm not only attending your event, but also associating my name with it</aside><p><strong>Boring website</strong>. The higher the level of the conference, the more modern and beautiful their website has to be. It&#39;s not only your but also my face. I&#39;m not only attending your event, but also associating my name with it. I will share your website on my Twitter, my Facebook, my blog, etc. That&#39;s why I really want it to look cool. Some conferences don&#39;t care about that and this attitude seriously demotivates me as a speaker.</p><p><strong>Cheap venue</strong>. This means literally what it says---the place is too cheap and, because of that, bad. The impression of such a place ruins the entire conference. Don&#39;t fool yourself, if it&#39;s cheap---it&#39;s bad. Into this category I would also place venues that are not designed to be conference hosts, like cinemas or offices. They will also be cheaper than proper venues, but you will get what you pay for.</p><p><strong>No introduction</strong>. I believe it&#39;s a job of conference organizers to promote me as a speaker in front of the audience. Not only on the stage, but also online, via Twitter, Facebook, etc. Most conferences don&#39;t do that at all. I come to the stage completely unannounced with almost zero interest from the room. They simply don&#39;t know who I am and why I&#39;m here. The conference must promote us, the speakers, very pro-actively.</p><p><strong>Slow WiFi</strong>. It&#39;s just very annoying.</p><aside class='quote'>Just make 5-10 such short intros and I will busy talking to these guys for the whole day</aside><p><strong>No networking</strong>. Conference organizers know all speakers who are attending and most of the listeners. They are at the center of this networking event, but they almost never use that position effectively. They should help me network while I&#39;m there by introducing me to those who I may be interested in. This won&#39;t be hard at all for them. Just tell me &quot;hey, let me introduce you to this guy who is working and speaking about something similar to you.&quot; Just make 5-10 such short intros and I will busy talking to these guys for the whole day. Instead, in most conferences, speakers arrive, speak, drink their coffee and leave. That&#39;s sad.</p><p><strong>No video</strong>. Most conferences don&#39;t record videos and it&#39;s a terrible mistake. They probably think that their events are more important then us, their speakers. It&#39;s not true. I&#39;m speaking in front of 50 people, video recording it on my iPhone, publishing it in my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCr9qCdqXLm2SU0BIs6d_68Q">YouTube channel</a> and getting 500 views in the first week. So, who is more important, your event which was able to attract just 50 people or my YouTube channel that attracted 500? Thus, I would strongly recommend paying a lot of attention to video recording and its quality. Preferably, you should record from two cameras (the speaker and the room) and do video editing afterwards. It&#39;s expensive, but very important.</p><p><strong>Bad Equipment</strong>. I mean sound, light, projectors, screens, microphones, etc. It&#39;s very annoying to see how speakers and the audience suffer from all that technical problems.</p><p><strong>Too small</strong>. It&#39;s very difficult to present when there is less than 100 people in the room. According to my experience, only one out of 10-15 people is actually listening and understanding. It&#39;s an average number. Of course, it depends on the subject, but not too much. This means that if there are 30 people in the room, only a few of them are my active listeners. It&#39;s very difficult to present to just a few people. You simply can&#39;t afford to lose their attention, even for a second. With a hundred people, the situation becomes more manageable. There are 8-12 people who are actively listening. Even if I lose a few of them, it&#39;s not a big deal. The best size of the room is 250 people. That&#39;s the ideal audience for a technical talk.</p><p><strong>Too big</strong>. A very big audience (over 500 people in the room) causes another problem---I completely lose any contact with my listeners. I don&#39;t see their eyes any more. I can&#39;t see their reaction, I don&#39;t understand whether they follow me or not. I&#39;m not a technical speaker any more, but a rock singer. All I can do is turn my presentation into a show and play with their emotions, not their brains. This is actually what most <a href="/2016/05/10/keynote-clowns.html">keynote speakers</a> are usually doing.</p><aside class='quote'>A perfect conference must have one track, a room for 250-300 listeners, and a very well selected list of speakers</aside><p><strong>Too many tracks</strong>. Honestly, I think that the very idea of having multiple tracks is very bad. I want the entire conference to attend my talk. I don&#39;t want to lose anyone. Moreover, I don&#39;t want to compete with some <a href="/2016/05/10/keynote-clowns.html">clown</a> (no offense to clowns) just because he is speaking at the same time. It&#39;s a very demotivating competition, since I can&#39;t do anything to win. I want to feel that I&#39;m speaking here because there is some value in my information. I want to know that I&#39;m the chosen one. And I want to feel that conference attendees feel the same. A perfect conference must have one track, a room for 250-300 listeners, and a very well selected list of speakers. I believe that most conferences are shooting themselves in the foot trying to please the audience by inviting too many speakers. Instead, do your homework right---select the best speakers and don&#39;t make listeners walk from track to track cursing you for the mediocre speeches. Choosing speakers is your job! Don&#39;t delegate it to your audience.</p><hr/><p>Did I forget anything?

It&#39;s risky and some people may disagree with you. That&#39;s not good. The goal is to have everybody in the room completely agree with what you&#39;re saying. That&#39;s how you make a good speech. The audience will be comfortable and relaxed, and you will have no risk of being questioned afterwards.

You must open with a joke and continue with many of them. Prepare them carefully. Just Google &quot;good keynote jokes&quot; and use what smart people recommend. A well-prepared collection of jokes is much more valuable than the content you will be talking about. Nobody will remember the content, but the jokes will definitely be re-tweeted.

It&#39;s easier for everybody. First, conference organizers will know for sure what will you be talking about. They can even watch your 4-year-old video-recorded presentation and see exactly what words and slides you&#39;re planning to use. Second, you won&#39;t be nervous, since you&#39;ll be saying the same jokes over and over again. Everybody wins.</p><p><strong>Kitties!</strong> Cute kitties. We all love them! Attach them somehow to your content. It is not really important whether they are related or not. You must show love. Instead of cats you can use a picture of your 2-y.o. daughter or yourself in a primary school. It has to be something sweet and adorable.</p><p><strong>Keep talking!</strong> A good keynote speech fills the entire 60 minutes, leaving absolutely no time for questions. Actually, a perfect speaker will be interrupted after the 145th slide and will say that if anyone wants to know more, there is always a place near the restroom, let&#39;s go there and continue. Thus, be focused on your slides and try to avoid questions at the end---they may create a negative impression of you if you mess up answering their questions.
