He texted me today: “[At Zerocracy] there is no commitment and anybody is free to leave any time, so the risk of entrusting a highly important project to such a platform and failing to deliver it on time is very high. We will develop it on our own with hired developers who will have salaries, and I’ll be architect and project manager, that way it will be under our entire control.” I think this word “control” he used deserves a comment.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;!--more--&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;jb_picture&quot;&gt;&lt;img itemprop=&quot;image&quot; alt=&quot;The Drop (2014) by Michaël R. Roskam&quot; src=&quot;/images/2018/10/the-drop.jpg&quot; longdesc=&quot;#c9f2bfd5&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption id=&quot;c9f2bfd5&quot;&gt;The Drop (2014) by Michaël R. Roskam&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;First, I know how much we hate the word “control” when it’s being applied to us sensitive and fragile individuals, also known as computer geeks. We don’t want to be under anyone’s control. We also don’t want to control others. We prefer to think that things just move forward on their own, not because someone stays on top of them and controls them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, this is an illusion.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We and our projects have to be under control in order for the projects to be completed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;OK, replace it with managed, organized, or (I love this word) orchestrated.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The bottom line is: you control it or you lose it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What does control technically mean? According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_%28management%29&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;, it means “setting standards, measuring actual performance and taking &lt;em&gt;corrective action&lt;/em&gt;.” What are the corrective actions in the context of people management? There are two: rewards and punishments. In order to keep even the &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/08/13/strict-code-quality-control.html&quot;&gt;most talented people&lt;/a&gt; under control, we have to reward them for their successes and punish or &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/09/16/how-to-fire-someone-right.html&quot;&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt; them for their failures.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The question is how you do that. How do you reward and how do you punish?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Even if you don’t want to admit that you do it, you still do. You reward and you punish. How does it happen in a traditional management model with the “hired developers” my prospective client was talking about? I’ve explained it already in a few blog posts. &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/12/06/how-to-pay-programmers-less.html&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;How to Pay Programmers Less&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/01/05/how-to-punish-employees.html&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;How Do You Punish Your Employees?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; are probably the best two of them. Managers invent &lt;a href=&quot;/2018/08/29/soft-skills.html&quot;&gt;nice words&lt;/a&gt; for these things, but in reality it’s still the same carrot-and-stick, only with no predictability and no explicit &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/10/13/competition-without-rules.html&quot;&gt;rules&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, if you think that you can control &lt;em&gt;professional&lt;/em&gt; programmers using the methods explained in my blog posts above, you are mistaken. We are way smarter than you. We know how to pretend to be working, while doing something else. We know how to create an illusion that we are loyal to the project, while searching the market for a new job. We know how to organize our time such that you only get ten percent of it, if you are lucky. We know &lt;a href=&quot;/2017/08/01/how-to-manage-a-manager.html&quot;&gt;how to manage&lt;/a&gt; you, our &lt;del&gt;stupid&lt;/del&gt; managers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As our manager, expecting us to be under control and loyal just because you hired us with &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/07/21/hourly-pay-modern-slavery.html&quot;&gt;monthly salaries&lt;/a&gt;, you are demonstrating only one thing to us: you have no idea how to manage senior developers. Instead, we will manage you. You will be under our control, not the other way around. If you are lucky, the project will &lt;em&gt;maybe&lt;/em&gt; see its end. But in most cases this doesn’t happen.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Do you want to know what real control is? Read this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zerocracy.com/policy.html&quot;&gt;Policy&lt;/a&gt;, which is how we &lt;em&gt;control&lt;/em&gt; programming in Zerocracy. That is the level of control true professionals enjoy. That document, fully supported by our &lt;a href=&quot;/2018/03/21/zerocracy-announcement.html&quot;&gt;automated chatbot&lt;/a&gt;, guides every small piece of reward and punishment a programmer may have on a project.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is what true commitment means for our guys: personal and &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/04/13/no-obligations-principle.html&quot;&gt;explicit responsibility&lt;/a&gt; for every single step they make. This level of commitment is incomparably better than what you will likely find when hiring full-time 9-to-5 &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/10/06/how-to-be-good-office-slave.html&quot;&gt;office&lt;/a&gt; &lt;del&gt;slaves&lt;/del&gt; employees.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What are they really committed to? To giving you a month’s notice when they finally find a better place to scroll through Facebook eight hours a day?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Seriously?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Who really is in charge, you or your boss? &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/codeahead?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#codeahead&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Yegor Bugayenko (@yegor256) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/yegor256/status/1048824708068777984?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;October 7, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt; " /> <meta name="keywords" content="next, path, output, content, previous, url, relative_path, id, collection, excerpt, draft, categories, layout, title, date, place, tags, description, keywords, image, jb_picture, slug, ext" /> <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1"/> <meta name="google-site-verification" content="JEj_gQr2CPe2QKGw8XdMz0R7VboQIUbX3FlM-lwTq-8" /> <meta name="author" content="Yegor Bugayenko"> <meta name="article:published_time" content="2018-10-09 00:00:00 +0000"> <meta name="og:site_name" content="Yegor Bugayenko"/> <meta name="og:type" content="article" /> <meta name="og:locale" content="en_US" /> <meta name="twitter:account_id" content="4503599630178231" /> <meta name="twitter:creator" content="@yegor256"/> <meta name="twitter:site" content="@yegor256"/> <meta name="twitter:title" property="og:title" content="You Think You Can Control Us?"/> <meta name="twitter:description" property="og:description" content="&lt;p&gt;I was explaining how &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zerocracy.com&quot;&gt;Zerocracy&lt;/a&gt; works to one of our prospective clients yesterday.

He said that he needed a partner, to help him partially finance the project, promote it, bring in new ideas, and push the business forward. I liked the business idea and wanted to participate. I started to ask questions about our future partnership and attempted to draw a simple partnership agreement. He quickly got offended. He said that he was looking for a &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; partner, who would share his goals and would never require any papers or lawyers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;!--more--&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;jb_picture&quot;&gt;&lt;img itemprop=&quot;image&quot; alt=&quot;Lola rennt (1998) by Tom Tykwer&quot; src=&quot;/images/2018/08/run-lola-run.jpg&quot; longdesc=&quot;#8ad64182&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption id=&quot;8ad64182&quot;&gt;Lola rennt (1998) by Tom Tykwer&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Here is a list of the questions I asked him:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;What happens with my shares if I stop working?&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Can I start a similar business with another partner later?&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Who will have a checkbook and bank account access?&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Who has final say if we disagree?&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Do I need your permission to sell my shares to a friend?&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Will there be any vesting schedule?&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Who approves expenses?&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Who controls the domain name registrar account?&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Who pays if the project needs more money?&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;For the majority of people I attempt to do business with, these questions are indeed offensive. They feel like I’m trying to draw a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prenuptial_agreement&quot;&gt;prenup&lt;/a&gt; between us, while they would prefer our “marriage” to be based solely on love. They would have us promise to never betray each other’s mutual interests but then the business suffers and eventually collapses.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;They just want to have 70%... each!!! And they have it.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;Why so? Because it’s impossible to be equal in business (just like it’s impossible to be equal in marriage, but that’s a topic for another blog post). Eventually a conflict of interests shows up and the inability to resolve it affects and damages the business. “Co-founder disputes have historically been one of the top reasons startups fail at the earliest possible stage,” &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/18/co-founder-conflict/&quot;&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/garrytan&quot;&gt;Garry Tan&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I would call that type of partnership, which many young startup founders enter into, “70/70.” For them the initial agreement is not a formula of future growth, but a symbol of &lt;em&gt;respect&lt;/em&gt;. Each of them wants to be respected and that’s why they demand 70% of the business for themselves. They don’t care and don’t understand how exactly the distribution of assets and profit will work in the future. They don’t foresee forthcoming conflicts and fights, mostly because they are too young or naive (or both). According to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://hbr.org/2008/02/the-founders-dilemma&quot;&gt;The Founder’s Dilemma&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noam_T._Wasserman&quot;&gt;Noam Wasserman&lt;/a&gt;, “Founders’ attachment, overconfidence, and naïveté may be necessary to get new ventures up and running, but these emotions later create problems.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They just want to have 70%… each!!!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s not even 50/50 in most cases, but 70/70. This is what makes it funny. Very often each partner thinks that he or she is the major contributor to the project and that’s why it’s 70%.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;You can't trust me to stand by my words, if there were no words.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;And they have it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When I was younger, I had no problem with entering into such an agreement. I was saying to myself: he wants 70% but he doesn’t understand that in reality he won’t even get a single percent, since, for example, we didn’t put the ownership of the domain name into the contract. It is obvious right from the start that the partner is ready to trust me blindly, without even thinking about possible consequences. In the end, all of us, and our startups, were losing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Don’t get me wrong, trust between partners is a crucial and mandatory element of any deal. But you can’t trust me to stand by my words, if there were &lt;em&gt;no words&lt;/em&gt;. If we never discussed, for example, how much I get when I quit because I’m fed up with you, I will try to get as much as possible and where exactly that line of 70% goes will be a subject for an ugly debate. And this will happen in very different circumstances, where there will be, most probably, no love between us or maybe even friendship. In that future fight the one who is the most aggressive and cunning will win. Do you really want that to be me? Or do you expect it to be you?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now I’m a bit older and more experienced. I’ve seen those ugly debates and don’t want them anymore. I don’t want the investment of my time and my money to go down the drain. I want to know upfront what exactly will happen with them in a month, a year, and a few decades, when I retire and my grandchildren inherit them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That’s why I ask all those “offensive” questions upfront. If the other side does indeed get offended, I attempt to explain to them what I just said in this article. If they don’t understand and still want to marry me out of love, I walk away. As &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.paulgraham.com/startupmistakes.html&quot;&gt;Paul Graham&lt;/a&gt;, a co-founder of Y Combinator, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.paulgraham.com/startupmistakes.html&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;, “Most of the disputes I’ve seen between founders could have been avoided if they’d been more careful about who they started a company with.” I don’t want to start a business with those who are scared of a prenup. I know that in that case the divorce will be ugly.&lt;/p&gt; " /> <meta name="keywords" content="next, path, output, content, previous, url, relative_path, id, collection, excerpt, draft, categories, layout, title, date, place, tags, description, keywords, image, jb_picture, slug, ext" /> <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1"/> <meta name="google-site-verification" content="JEj_gQr2CPe2QKGw8XdMz0R7VboQIUbX3FlM-lwTq-8" /> <meta name="author" content="Yegor Bugayenko"> <meta name="article:published_time" content="2018-08-14 00:00:00 +0000"> <meta name="og:site_name" content="Yegor Bugayenko"/> <meta name="og:type" content="article" /> <meta name="og:locale" content="en_US" /> <meta name="twitter:account_id" content="4503599630178231" /> <meta name="twitter:creator" content="@yegor256"/> <meta name="twitter:site" content="@yegor256"/> <meta name="twitter:title" property="og:title" content="70/70"/> <meta name="twitter:description" property="og:description" content="&lt;p&gt;A few days ago, a friend of mine asked me to join him in a new startup.

What, for example, did Dave McClure do in order to be kicked out of the company he founded?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Let’s see. According to Katie Benner from The New York Times, he sent &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/30/technology/women-entrepreneurs-speak-out-sexual-harassment.html&quot;&gt;this message&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/sarahkunst&quot;&gt;Sarah Kunst&lt;/a&gt;, who was an applicant at his incubator in 2014 (other “harassers” were accused of doing something very similar):&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;I was getting confused figuring out whether to hire you or hit on you.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Obviously he was flirting. And what’s wrong with that? Can’t we flirt any more? Is it a crime all of a sudden? One thing is wrong though. It was a &lt;em&gt;threat&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Even though this message didn’t say it explicitly, it actually &lt;em&gt;implied&lt;/em&gt; that “you either go along and we go out, or you won’t be hired.” Of course, “no hire” may not hurt as much as a knife or a fist in the face, but it does hurt. Especially if you are a woman, a member of a minority group.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I’m a &lt;del&gt;sexist&lt;/del&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;/2017/07/04/sexism.html&quot;&gt;gentleman&lt;/a&gt;, I feel bad when I see women being threatened. I want to protect them and I expect our system of justice to help me, just like it helps when we deal with physical violence. These threats or attempts to threaten must be punished.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There is nothing wrong with the game between the sexes by itself. Just like we don’t prohibit sex because we are afraid of rapists, we must not stop asking women out because of our fear of a possible harassment accusation. However, it seems that this is what is happening now: men are becoming &lt;em&gt;afraid&lt;/em&gt; of women. Especially powerful men with money and status. They realize that a small incautious step may help them become the next Dave or Travis.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This fear is destroying us.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thanks to this fear our &lt;em&gt;masculine&lt;/em&gt; characteristics become a victim of this dangerous game that society is playing right now, with a noble intent to protect women against verbal and psychological abuse. We men are losing our self-confidence, our self-esteem, our &lt;del&gt;balls&lt;/del&gt; courage.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This fear mentally castrates us.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We must be absolutely clear that those harassers are guilty not because they “made advances” towards women who work with them or for them, but because they were &lt;em&gt;threatening&lt;/em&gt; those ladies. There is nothing wrong in being attracted to a woman, no matter who she is: your boss, your employee, your schoolmate, or the founder of the business you’re investing in. Moreover, there is nothing wrong in making advances, falling in love, having sex and marrying them. Threatening them in order to get all that is very wrong.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Not every flirtation is harassment. Not every man with a sexual instinct is a rapist.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;How would I re-phrase that message to Sarah if I had been Dave and had fallen in love with her at first sight? I would probably say:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;I was getting confused, figuring out how to isolate my hiring process from my desire to hit on you. How about dinner? I promise, no matter how it ends, it will not affect our hiring decision at all.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;I realize that it’s not perfect, since she wouldn’t be completely comfortable, and still might expect Dave’s feelings to affect his hiring decision if it turns out she doesn’t like him or simply already has a partner. However, this would seem like a respectful attempt to put the weapon down.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is difficult to not threaten a woman if you’re holding a gun in your hand while asking her out.

What, for example, did Dave McClure do in order to be kicked out of the company he founded?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Let’s see. According to Katie Benner from The New York Times, he sent &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/30/technology/women-entrepreneurs-speak-out-sexual-harassment.html&quot;&gt;this message&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/sarahkunst&quot;&gt;Sarah Kunst&lt;/a&gt;, who was an applicant at his incubator in 2014 (other “harassers” were accused of doing something very similar):&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;I was getting confused figuring out whether to hire you or hit on you.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Obviously he was flirting. And what’s wrong with that? Can’t we flirt any more? Is it a crime all of a sudden? One thing is wrong though. It was a &lt;em&gt;threat&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Even though this message didn’t say it explicitly, it actually &lt;em&gt;implied&lt;/em&gt; that “you either go along and we go out, or you won’t be hired.” Of course, “no hire” may not hurt as much as a knife or a fist in the face, but it does hurt. Especially if you are a woman, a member of a minority group.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I’m a &lt;del&gt;sexist&lt;/del&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;/2017/07/04/sexism.html&quot;&gt;gentleman&lt;/a&gt;, I feel bad when I see women being threatened. I want to protect them and I expect our system of justice to help me, just like it helps when we deal with physical violence. These threats or attempts to threaten must be punished.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There is nothing wrong with the game between the sexes by itself. Just like we don’t prohibit sex because we are afraid of rapists, we must not stop asking women out because of our fear of a possible harassment accusation. However, it seems that this is what is happening now: men are becoming &lt;em&gt;afraid&lt;/em&gt; of women. Especially powerful men with money and status. They realize that a small incautious step may help them become the next Dave or Travis.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This fear is destroying us.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thanks to this fear our &lt;em&gt;masculine&lt;/em&gt; characteristics become a victim of this dangerous game that society is playing right now, with a noble intent to protect women against verbal and psychological abuse. We men are losing our self-confidence, our self-esteem, our &lt;del&gt;balls&lt;/del&gt; courage.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This fear mentally castrates us.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We must be absolutely clear that those harassers are guilty not because they “made advances” towards women who work with them or for them, but because they were &lt;em&gt;threatening&lt;/em&gt; those ladies. There is nothing wrong in being attracted to a woman, no matter who she is: your boss, your employee, your schoolmate, or the founder of the business you’re investing in. Moreover, there is nothing wrong in making advances, falling in love, having sex and marrying them. Threatening them in order to get all that is very wrong.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Not every flirtation is harassment. Not every man with a sexual instinct is a rapist.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;How would I re-phrase that message to Sarah if I had been Dave and had fallen in love with her at first sight? I would probably say:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;I was getting confused, figuring out how to isolate my hiring process from my desire to hit on you. How about dinner? I promise, no matter how it ends, it will not affect our hiring decision at all.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;I realize that it’s not perfect, since she wouldn’t be completely comfortable, and still might expect Dave’s feelings to affect his hiring decision if it turns out she doesn’t like him or simply already has a partner. However, this would seem like a respectful attempt to put the weapon down.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is difficult to not threaten a woman if you’re holding a gun in your hand while asking her out. Money and power is the gun.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Guys, let’s be very careful. However, let’s not forget how to seduce women and fall in love with them. We have to stay men, especially when some of those among us are weak abusers deserving no respect.&lt;/p&gt; "/> <meta name="twitter:url" property="og:url"

Just like we don’t prohibit sex because we are afraid of rapists, we must not stop asking women out because of our fear of a possible harassment accusation. However, it seems that this is what is happening now: men are becoming <em>afraid</em> of women. Especially powerful men with money and status. They realize that a small incautious step may help them become the next Dave or Travis.</p><p>This fear is destroying us.</p><p>Thanks to this fear our <em>masculine</em> characteristics become a victim of this dangerous game that society is playing right now, with a noble intent to protect women against verbal and psychological abuse. We men are losing our self-confidence, our self-esteem, our <del>balls</del> courage.</p><p>This fear mentally castrates us.</p><p>We must be absolutely clear that those harassers are guilty not because they “made advances” towards women who work with them or for them, but because they were <em>threatening</em> those ladies. There is nothing wrong in being attracted to a woman, no matter who she is: your boss, your employee, your schoolmate, or the founder of the business you’re investing in. Moreover, there is nothing wrong in making advances, falling in love, having sex and marrying them. Threatening them in order to get all that is very wrong.</p><p>Not every flirtation is harassment. Not every man with a sexual instinct is a rapist.</p><p>How would I re-phrase that message to Sarah if I had been Dave and had fallen in love with her at first sight? I would probably say:</p><blockquote><p>I was getting confused, figuring out how to isolate my hiring process from my desire to hit on you. How about dinner? I promise, no matter how it ends, it will not affect our hiring decision at all.</p></blockquote><p>I realize that it’s not perfect, since she wouldn’t be completely comfortable, and still might expect Dave’s feelings to affect his hiring decision if it turns out she doesn’t like him or simply already has a partner. However, this would seem like a respectful attempt to put the weapon down.</p><p>It is difficult to not threaten a woman if you’re holding a gun in your hand while asking her out. Money and power is the gun.</p><p>Guys, let’s be very careful. However, let’s not forget how to seduce women and fall in love with them. We have to stay men, especially when some of those among us are weak abusers deserving no respect.</p></div></article></div><div class="wrapper"> <related-posts /></div><div class="disqus" role="complementary"><p class="disqus_hint"> Please, use <a href="https://help.disqus.com/commenting/what-html-tags-are-allowed-within-comments">syntax highlighting</a> in your comments, to make them more readable.</p><div id="disqus_thread" class="disqus-thread"> <a>&nbsp;</a></div><script> var disqus_config = function () { this.page.url = document.location.href.split('?')[0].split('#')[0].replace('https://', 'http://'); this.page.identifier = this.page.url; }; (function() { var d = document, s = d.createElement('script'); s.src = '//yegor256.disqus.com/embed.js'; s.setAttribute('data-timestamp', +new Date()); (d.head || d.body).appendChild(s); })(); </script> <noscript><div><p class="red"> JavaScript is disabled in your browser, that's why you can't see comments under this post.</p></div></noscript></div><div class="wrapper"> <footer class="footer"><p> &copy; <span itemscope="" itemprop="copyrightHolder" itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"> <span itemprop="name">Yegor Bugayenko</span> </span> 2014&ndash;<span itemprop="copyrightYear">2018</span></p></footer></div></section><div class="wrapper unprintable" style="text-align:center;margin-top:2em;"> <a href="http://www.sixnines.io/h/3ba1652f"> <img src="//www.sixnines.io/b/3ba1652f?style=flat" alt="sixnines availability badge"/> </a></div><script src="//code.jquery.com/jquery-1.9.0.min.js"></script> <script src="/js/all.js?c998b88f617"></script> <script>var disqus_shortname = 'yegor256';</script> <script id="dsq-count-scr" src="//yegor256.disqus.com/count.js" async="async"></script> <script> (function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){ (i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o), m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m) })(window,document,'script','//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga'); ga('create', 'UA-1963507-32', 'auto'); ga('send', 'pageview'); </script> <script> Cd=document;Cr="&"+Math.random();Cp="&s=1"; Cd.cookie="b=b";if(Cd.cookie)Cp+="&c=1"; Cp+="&t="+(new Date()).getTimezoneOffset(); if(self!=top)Cp+="&f=1"; </script> <script> if(navigator.javaEnabled())Cp+="&j=1"; </script> <script> if(typeof(screen)!='undefined')Cp+="&w="+screen.width+"&h="+ screen.height+"&d="+(screen.colorDepth?screen.colorDepth:screen.pixelDepth); </script> <script> Cd.write("<img src='//c.hit.ua/hit?i=95870&g=0&x=2"+Cp+Cr+ "&r="+escape(Cd.referrer)+"&u="+escape(window.location.href)+ "' border='0' wi"+"dth='1' he"+"ight='1'/>"); </script> <script type="application/ld+json"> { "@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Person", "name": "Yegor Bugayenko", "url": "https://www.yegor256.com", "sameAs": [ "https://www.facebook.com/yegor256", "https://instagram.com/yegor256", "https://www.linkedin.com/in/yegor256", "https://twitter.com/yegor256", "https://github.com/yegor256", "https://www.pinterest.com/yegor256/" ] } </script> </body> </html> <!DOCTYPE html> <html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/WebSite"> <head> <meta charset="utf-8"/> <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Recently I said a few words in my &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.me/joinchat/AAAAAEJFMRzsRTRxM3ec6A&quot;&gt;Telegram group&lt;/a&gt; about “women in tech,” which led to some negative &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/delawen/status/880517810400759808&quot;&gt;reaction&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter.

I do realize that their recruiters don’t care about my answers—they simply click “delete” and move on. I also realize that they will never see this post, and this article probably won’t change anything. However, I have to write it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;youtube&quot;&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhWOlaMqppM&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;box&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZhWOlaMqppM/mqdefault.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;YouTube video #ZhWOlaMqppM&quot; /&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;play&quot;&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;icon icon-play&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;div&gt;How I didn't get a job at Amazon (in Russian with English subtitles); 21 December 2017.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is what I’m sending back to them:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thanks for your email. I’m very interested indeed. I have nothing against an interview. However, there is one condition: I have to be interviewed by the person I will be working for. By my future direct manager.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;The recruiter who gets this reply never gets back to me.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Why do I send this?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Well, because I learned my lesson two years ago, when Amazon tried to recruit me. I got an email from the company that said they were so impressed by my profile and couldn’t wait to start working with me. They needed me, nobody else. I was naive, and the message did flatter me.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;They paid for my ticket to fly there and a night in a 5-star hotel. I was impressed.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;We scheduled an interview in the head office in Seattle. They paid for my ticket to fly there (from San Francisco) and a night in a 5-star hotel. I was impressed. They definitely were interested. So was I.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What happened at the interview was, most probably, very close to what Max Howell &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mxcl/status/608682016205344768&quot;&gt;experienced&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9695102&quot;&gt;with Google&lt;/a&gt;: some programmers who didn’t know a thing about my profile asked me to invent some algorithms on a white board for almost four hours. Did I manage? I don’t think so. Did they make me an offer? No.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What did I learn?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That it was a waste of time. For both sides.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Their bureaucratic machine is designed to process hundreds of candidates a month. In order to fish and attract them, there is an army of &lt;del&gt;monkeys&lt;/del&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/09/29/mayonnaise.html&quot;&gt;recruiters&lt;/a&gt; sending warm emails to people like me. They have to screen candidates somehow, and they are too lazy to make this process effective and creative. They just send them through random programmers who are supposed to ask as complex questions as possible.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I’m not saying that people who pass their tests are not good programmers. I’m also not saying that I’m a good programmer—let’s face it, I didn’t pass the test. I do believe this filtering system is rather good. My point is that it contradicts the original email I got from the recruiter.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If she would have started her email with “We’re looking for an algorithm expert,” we would never have gotten any further and would not have wasted our time. Clearly, I’m not an expert in algorithms. There is no point in giving me binary-tree-traversing questions; I don’t know those answers and will never be interested in learning them. I’m trying to be an expert in something else, like &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/11/29/eolang.html&quot;&gt;object-oriented design&lt;/a&gt;, for example.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;There is no point in giving me binary-tree-traversing questions; I don't know those answers and will never be interested in learning them.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;There was a clear mismatch between my profile and the expectations of the interviewers. I don’t blame them, and I don’t blame her. They all were just &lt;del&gt;slaves&lt;/del&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/10/06/how-to-be-good-office-slave.html&quot;&gt;employees&lt;/a&gt;. I blame myself for not setting this all straight at the very beginning.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I should have told her that I didn’t want to be interviewed by &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; programmers, because I would most certainly fail. There was no need to try. I wanted to be interviewed by the person who really &lt;em&gt;needed&lt;/em&gt; me: my future boss. That person will understand my profile and won’t ask pointless questions about algorithms, simply because he or she will know what my duties will be and what kind of problems I will be capable of solving, if they hired me.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, as I keep observing from two years of bouncing such emails back to recruiters, they can’t change anything. They have to provide formal and standard screening for everybody, beginning with those same warm and flattering initial promises.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I’m sorry, recruiters, no more standard interviews for me.&lt;/p&gt; " /> <meta name="keywords" content="next, path, output, content, previous, url, relative_path, id, collection, excerpt, draft, categories, layout, title, date, place, tags, description, keywords, translated, social, image, jb_picture, republished, slug, ext" /> <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1"/> <meta name="google-site-verification" content="JEj_gQr2CPe2QKGw8XdMz0R7VboQIUbX3FlM-lwTq-8" /> <meta name="author" content="Yegor Bugayenko"> <meta name="article:published_time" content="2017-02-21 00:00:00 +0000"> <meta name="og:site_name" content="Yegor Bugayenko"/> <meta name="og:type" content="article" /> <meta name="og:locale" content="en_US" /> <meta name="twitter:account_id" content="4503599630178231" /> <meta name="twitter:creator" content="@yegor256"/> <meta name="twitter:site" content="@yegor256"/> <meta name="twitter:title" property="og:title" content="Why I Don't Talk to Google Recruiters"/> <meta name="twitter:description" property="og:description" content="&lt;p&gt;This is a real story, and it’s not only about Google.

I was impressed.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;We scheduled an interview in the head office in Seattle. They paid for my ticket to fly there (from San Francisco) and a night in a 5-star hotel. I was impressed. They definitely were interested. So was I.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What happened at the interview was, most probably, very close to what Max Howell &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mxcl/status/608682016205344768&quot;&gt;experienced&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9695102&quot;&gt;with Google&lt;/a&gt;: some programmers who didn’t know a thing about my profile asked me to invent some algorithms on a white board for almost four hours. Did I manage? I don’t think so. Did they make me an offer? No.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What did I learn?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That it was a waste of time. For both sides.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Their bureaucratic machine is designed to process hundreds of candidates a month. In order to fish and attract them, there is an army of &lt;del&gt;monkeys&lt;/del&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/09/29/mayonnaise.html&quot;&gt;recruiters&lt;/a&gt; sending warm emails to people like me. They have to screen candidates somehow, and they are too lazy to make this process effective and creative. They just send them through random programmers who are supposed to ask as complex questions as possible.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I’m not saying that people who pass their tests are not good programmers. I’m also not saying that I’m a good programmer—let’s face it, I didn’t pass the test. I do believe this filtering system is rather good. My point is that it contradicts the original email I got from the recruiter.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If she would have started her email with “We’re looking for an algorithm expert,” we would never have gotten any further and would not have wasted our time. Clearly, I’m not an expert in algorithms. There is no point in giving me binary-tree-traversing questions; I don’t know those answers and will never be interested in learning them. I’m trying to be an expert in something else, like &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/11/29/eolang.html&quot;&gt;object-oriented design&lt;/a&gt;, for example.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;There is no point in giving me binary-tree-traversing questions; I don't know those answers and will never be interested in learning them.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;There was a clear mismatch between my profile and the expectations of the interviewers. I don’t blame them, and I don’t blame her. They all were just &lt;del&gt;slaves&lt;/del&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/10/06/how-to-be-good-office-slave.html&quot;&gt;employees&lt;/a&gt;. I blame myself for not setting this all straight at the very beginning.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I should have told her that I didn’t want to be interviewed by &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; programmers, because I would most certainly fail. There was no need to try. I wanted to be interviewed by the person who really &lt;em&gt;needed&lt;/em&gt; me: my future boss. That person will understand my profile and won’t ask pointless questions about algorithms, simply because he or she will know what my duties will be and what kind of problems I will be capable of solving, if they hired me.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, as I keep observing from two years of bouncing such emails back to recruiters, they can’t change anything. They have to provide formal and standard screening for everybody, beginning with those same warm and flattering initial promises.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I’m sorry, recruiters, no more standard interviews for me.&lt;/p&gt; "/> <meta name="twitter:url" property="og:url" content="https://www.yegor256.com/2017/02/21/say-no-to-google-recruiters.html"/> <meta name="telegram:channel"

They have to provide formal and standard screening for everybody, beginning with those same warm and flattering initial promises.</p><p>I’m sorry, recruiters, no more standard interviews for me.</p></div></article></div><div class="wrapper"> <related-posts /></div><div class="disqus" role="complementary"><p class="disqus_hint"> Please, use <a href="https://help.disqus.com/commenting/what-html-tags-are-allowed-within-comments">syntax highlighting</a> in your comments, to make them more readable.</p><div id="disqus_thread" class="disqus-thread"> <a>&nbsp;</a></div><script> var disqus_config = function () { this.page.url = document.location.href.split('?')[0].split('#')[0].replace('https://', 'http://'); this.page.identifier = this.page.url; }; (function() { var d = document, s = d.createElement('script'); s.src = '//yegor256.disqus.com/embed.js'; s.setAttribute('data-timestamp', +new Date()); (d.head || d.body).appendChild(s); })(); </script> <noscript><div><p class="red"> JavaScript is disabled in your browser, that's why you can't see comments under this post.</p></div></noscript></div><div class="wrapper"> <footer class="footer"><p> &copy; <span itemscope="" itemprop="copyrightHolder" itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"> <span itemprop="name">Yegor Bugayenko</span> </span> 2014&ndash;<span itemprop="copyrightYear">2018</span></p></footer></div></section><div class="wrapper unprintable" style="text-align:center;margin-top:2em;"> <a href="http://www.sixnines.io/h/3ba1652f"> <img src="//www.sixnines.io/b/3ba1652f?style=flat" alt="sixnines availability badge"/> </a></div><script src="//code.jquery.com/jquery-1.9.0.min.js"></script> <script src="/js/all.js?c998b88f617"></script> <script>var disqus_shortname = 'yegor256';</script> <script id="dsq-count-scr" src="//yegor256.disqus.com/count.js" async="async"></script> <script> (function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){ (i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o), m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m) })(window,document,'script','//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga'); ga('create', 'UA-1963507-32', 'auto'); ga('send', 'pageview'); </script> <script> Cd=document;Cr="&"+Math.random();Cp="&s=1"; Cd.cookie="b=b";if(Cd.cookie)Cp+="&c=1"; Cp+="&t="+(new Date()).getTimezoneOffset(); if(self!=top)Cp+="&f=1"; </script> <script> if(navigator.javaEnabled())Cp+="&j=1"; </script> <script> if(typeof(screen)!='undefined')Cp+="&w="+screen.width+"&h="+ screen.height+"&d="+(screen.colorDepth?screen.colorDepth:screen.pixelDepth); </script> <script> Cd.write("<img src='//c.hit.ua/hit?i=95870&g=0&x=2"+Cp+Cr+ "&r="+escape(Cd.referrer)+"&u="+escape(window.location.href)+ "' border='0' wi"+"dth='1' he"+"ight='1'/>"); </script> <script type="application/ld+json"> { "@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Person", "name": "Yegor Bugayenko", "url": "https://www.yegor256.com", "sameAs": [ "https://www.facebook.com/yegor256", "https://instagram.com/yegor256", "https://www.linkedin.com/in/yegor256", "https://twitter.com/yegor256", "https://github.com/yegor256", "https://www.pinterest.com/yegor256/" ] } </script> </body> </html> <!DOCTYPE html> <html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/WebSite"> <head> <meta charset="utf-8"/> <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;To create software, you need programmers. Unfortunately. They are expensive, &lt;a href=&quot;/2018/04/17/how-to-be-lazy.html&quot;&gt;lazy&lt;/a&gt;, and almost impossible to control. The software they create either works or doesn’t, but you still have to pay them, every month. Of course, it’s always better to pay less.

Let me share.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;!--more--&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;jb_picture&quot;&gt;&lt;img itemprop=&quot;image&quot; alt=&quot;Ben-Hur (1959) by William Wyler&quot; src=&quot;/images/2016/12/ben-hur.jpg&quot; longdesc=&quot;#cdad7b09&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption id=&quot;cdad7b09&quot;&gt;Ben-Hur (1959) by William Wyler&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keep salaries secret&lt;/strong&gt;. It’s obvious: Don’t let them discuss &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/07/21/hourly-pay-modern-slavery.html&quot;&gt;salaries&lt;/a&gt;. They must keep this information secret. Warn them or even sign &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/05/04/how-to-protect-business-idea.html&quot;&gt;NDAs&lt;/a&gt; prohibiting any talks about wages, bonuses, compensation plans, etc. They must feel that this information is toxic and never even talk to each other about salaries. If they don’t know how much their coworkers are getting, they won’t raise salary questions for much longer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Give raises randomly&lt;/strong&gt;. There should be no system behind your salary upgrades or &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/09/16/how-to-fire-someone-right.html&quot;&gt;firing decisions&lt;/a&gt;. You give them raises when you feel like it, not when they are being more productive or effective. Try to make your decisions unpredictable. Unpredictability creates fear, and this is exactly what you need. They will be afraid of you and will not complain about being underpaid for a long time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No conferences&lt;/strong&gt;. Don’t allow them to attend meetups or conferences. They may meet &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/09/29/mayonnaise.html&quot;&gt;recruiters&lt;/a&gt; there and find out that their salaries are not &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/10/29/how-much-do-you-cost.html&quot;&gt;fair enough&lt;/a&gt;. Promote the idea that conferences are just a waste of time. It’s better to organize events in the &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/08/05/distributed-teams-are-higher-quality.html&quot;&gt;office&lt;/a&gt;. They always have to stay together, never free to meet programmers from other companies. The less they know, the safer you are.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No work from home&lt;/strong&gt;. The office must be their second home. Well, preferably the first one. They must go there every day, have a desk there, a computer, a chair, and a stapler. They will be emotionally attached to the place and it will be very difficult to leave, no matter how underpaid they will be. Never allow them to work &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/08/05/distributed-teams-are-higher-quality.html&quot;&gt;remotely&lt;/a&gt;—they may start thinking about a new home with a bigger salary.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spy on them&lt;/strong&gt;. Make sure they all use your email server, computers, servers, and even mobile phones. Install software that tracks all their messages. Ideally, you should have a security department watching all of them and regularly informing you about abnormal or suspicious behavior (office cameras will help too). Any contact with other companies should be considered suspicious. Employees must know you’re spying on them. Extra fear is always helpful.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Brainwash them regularly by communicating how great your company is.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make a deal with competitors&lt;/strong&gt;. Contact your major competitors in the region and agree to not head-hunt their programmers if they don’t touch yours. If they reject this deal, try to recruit a few of their key engineers. Just offer to double their salaries. You won’t really hire them, of course, but this move will definitely shake your local market, and competitors will be afraid of you. They will agree to never touch your &lt;del&gt;slaves&lt;/del&gt; developers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Promote corporate values&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/03/02/team-morale-myths-and-reality.html&quot;&gt;Brainwash&lt;/a&gt; them regularly by communicating how great your company is, how big its mission is, and how important their contribution is. The numbers on their paychecks will look way less important compared to the multi-billion-dollar market the team is trying to dominate. They will sacrifice for a while. For quite a long time, this trick will work.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Build a family&lt;/strong&gt;. Corporate parties, Friday beer, team building events, bowling, birthdays, lunches and team nights—use these &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/03/02/team-morale-myths-and-reality.html&quot;&gt;tools&lt;/a&gt; to create a feeling that your company is their family. Money is not really what good people talk about in a family, right? Asking for a raise will sound like a betrayal of family values—they will be afraid to do that.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stress them&lt;/strong&gt;. They must not feel relaxed, it’s not in your favor. Make sure they have tight deadlines, complex problems to solve, and enough guilt on their shoulders. They won’t ask for a raise, constantly feeling guilty for letting you down with project goals. Try to make them responsible for failures as much as possible.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make promises&lt;/strong&gt;. You don’t need to keep them, but you have to make them: promise to raise their salaries soon, or by the time you raise investments, or by the time a big contract is signed, or when “the time is right.” It is important to always make your promises dependable on events that are out of your control—your hands must always be clean.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Instead of giving someone a raise, it's always better to buy a new PlayStation for the office.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Buy them cushion chairs and tennis tables&lt;/strong&gt;. Spend just a little on all those funny office things, and they will pay you back big time, through the ability to underpay your programmers. A fancy and professional coffee machine will cost you $1,000 and make it possible to save $200 to $300 on each programmer monthly. Do the math. Make yourself a rule that instead of giving someone a raise, it’s always better to buy a new PlayStation for the office. Also, let them bring their &lt;del&gt;spouses&lt;/del&gt; pets to the office—they will &lt;del&gt;work&lt;/del&gt; stay longer for less money.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Give them sound titles&lt;/strong&gt;. Call them Vice Presidents, for example VP of Engineering, VP of Technology, VP of Whatever. Not a big deal for you, but very important for them. The salary will be much less valuable than the title they can put on their LinkedIn profiles. If you’re running out of Vice Presidents, try &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/10/12/who-is-software-architect.html&quot;&gt;Senior Architect&lt;/a&gt;, Lead Technical Lead, Chief Scientist, etc.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;They will keep working for you for less money just because you're good friends.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Help them survive&lt;/strong&gt;. Most programmers are rather stupid when it comes to managing money. They simply don’t know how to buy insurance, how to plan a retirement fund, or even how to pay taxes. You help them, to your own benefit, of course. They will be happy to feel safe in your hands, and won’t leave you. They won’t ask for a raise, either, because they will feel bad about even starting such a negotiation. You must be the “parent,” and they will be the “kids.” It’s a good old model. It works.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be a friend&lt;/strong&gt;. This is the last and most powerful technique. You have to be a friend to your programmers. It’s very difficult to negotiate money with a friend—they won’t be able to do it easily. They will keep working for you for less money just because you’re good friends. How do you become friends? Well, meet their families, invite them over for dinner at your house, give them birthday gifts—all those tricks. They will save you a lot of money.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Did I forget anything?&lt;/p&gt; " /> <meta name="keywords" content="next, path, output, content, previous, url, relative_path, id, collection, excerpt, draft, categories, layout, title, date, tags, place, description, keywords, social, translated, related, image, jb_picture, slug, ext" /> <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1"/> <meta name="google-site-verification" content="JEj_gQr2CPe2QKGw8XdMz0R7VboQIUbX3FlM-lwTq-8" /> <meta name="author" content="Yegor Bugayenko"> <meta name="article:published_time" content="2016-12-06 00:00:00 +0000"> <meta name="og:site_name" content="Yegor Bugayenko"/> <meta name="og:type" content="article" /> <meta name="og:locale" content="en_US" /> <meta name="twitter:account_id" content="4503599630178231" /> <meta name="twitter:creator" content="@yegor256"/> <meta name="twitter:site" content="@yegor256"/> <meta name="twitter:title" property="og:title" content="How to Pay Programmers Less"/> <meta name="twitter:description" property="og:description" content="&lt;p&gt;To create software, you need programmers.

Unfortunately. They are expensive, <a href="/2018/04/17/how-to-be-lazy.html">lazy</a>, and almost impossible to control. The software they create either works or doesn’t, but you still have to pay them, every month. Of course, it’s always better to pay less. However, sometimes they may figure out they are being underpaid and quit. How do you prevent that? <a href="/2016/01/05/how-to-punish-employees.html">Unfortunately</a>, we can’t use violence any more, but there are some other mechanisms. Let me share.</p><figure class="jb_picture"><img itemprop="image" alt="Ben-Hur (1959) by William Wyler" src="/images/2016/12/ben-hur.jpg" longdesc="#cdad7b09" /><figcaption id="cdad7b09">Ben-Hur (1959) by William Wyler</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Keep salaries secret</strong>. It’s obvious: Don’t let them discuss <a href="/2015/07/21/hourly-pay-modern-slavery.html">salaries</a>. They must keep this information secret. Warn them or even sign <a href="/2015/05/04/how-to-protect-business-idea.html">NDAs</a> prohibiting any talks about wages, bonuses, compensation plans, etc. They must feel that this information is toxic and never even talk to each other about salaries. If they don’t know how much their coworkers are getting, they won’t raise salary questions for much longer.</p><p><strong>Give raises randomly</strong>. There should be no system behind your salary upgrades or <a href="/2015/09/16/how-to-fire-someone-right.html">firing decisions</a>. You give them raises when you feel like it, not when they are being more productive or effective. Try to make your decisions unpredictable. Unpredictability creates fear, and this is exactly what you need. They will be afraid of you and will not complain about being underpaid for a long time.</p><p><strong>No conferences</strong>. Don’t allow them to attend meetups or conferences. They may meet <a href="/2015/09/29/mayonnaise.html">recruiters</a> there and find out that their salaries are not <a href="/2014/10/29/how-much-do-you-cost.html">fair enough</a>. Promote the idea that conferences are just a waste of time. It’s better to organize events in the <a href="/2016/08/05/distributed-teams-are-higher-quality.html">office</a>. They always have to stay together, never free to meet programmers from other companies. The less they know, the safer you are.</p><p><strong>No work from home</strong>. The office must be their second home. Well, preferably the first one. They must go there every day, have a desk there, a computer, a chair, and a stapler. They will be emotionally attached to the place and it will be very difficult to leave, no matter how underpaid they will be. Never allow them to work <a href="/2016/08/05/distributed-teams-are-higher-quality.html">remotely</a>—they may start thinking about a new home with a bigger salary.</p><p><strong>Spy on them</strong>. Make sure they all use your email server, computers, servers, and even mobile phones. Install software that tracks all their messages. Ideally, you should have a security department watching all of them and regularly informing you about abnormal or suspicious behavior (office cameras will help too). Any contact with other companies should be considered suspicious. Employees must know you’re spying on them. Extra fear is always helpful.</p><aside class="quote">Brainwash them regularly by communicating how great your company is.</aside><p><strong>Make a deal with competitors</strong>. Contact your major competitors in the region and agree to not head-hunt their programmers if they don’t touch yours. If they reject this deal, try to recruit a few of their key engineers. Just offer to double their salaries. You won’t really hire them, of course, but this move will definitely shake your local market, and competitors will be afraid of you. They will agree to never touch your <del>slaves</del> developers.</p><p><strong>Promote corporate values</strong>. <a href="/2015/03/02/team-morale-myths-and-reality.html">Brainwash</a> them regularly by communicating how great your company is, how big its mission is, and how important their contribution is. The numbers on their paychecks will look way less important compared to the multi-billion-dollar market the team is trying to dominate. They will sacrifice for a while. For quite a long time, this trick will work.</p><p><strong>Build a family</strong>. Corporate parties, Friday beer, team building events, bowling, birthdays, lunches and team nights—use these <a href="/2015/03/02/team-morale-myths-and-reality.html">tools</a> to create a feeling that your company is their family. Money is not really what good people talk about in a family, right? Asking for a raise will sound like a betrayal of family values—they will be afraid to do that.</p><p><strong>Stress them</strong>. They must not feel relaxed, it’s not in your favor. Make sure they have tight deadlines, complex problems to solve, and enough guilt on their shoulders. They won’t ask for a raise, constantly feeling guilty for letting you down with project goals. Try to make them responsible for failures as much as possible.</p><p><strong>Make promises</strong>. You don’t need to keep them, but you have to make them: promise to raise their salaries soon, or by the time you raise investments, or by the time a big contract is signed, or when “the time is right.” It is important to always make your promises dependable on events that are out of your control—your hands must always be clean.</p><aside class="quote">Instead of giving someone a raise, it's always better to buy a new PlayStation for the office.</aside><p><strong>Buy them cushion chairs and tennis tables</strong>. Spend just a little on all those funny office things, and they will pay you back big time, through the ability to underpay your programmers. A fancy and professional coffee machine will cost you $1,000 and make it possible to save $200 to $300 on each programmer monthly. Do the math. Make yourself a rule that instead of giving someone a raise, it’s always better to buy a new PlayStation for the office. Also, let them bring their <del>spouses</del> pets to the office—they will <del>work</del> stay longer for less money.</p><p><strong>Give them sound titles</strong>. Call them Vice Presidents, for example VP of Engineering, VP of Technology, VP of Whatever. Not a big deal for you, but very important for them. The salary will be much less valuable than the title they can put on their LinkedIn profiles. If you’re running out of Vice Presidents, try <a href="/2014/10/12/who-is-software-architect.html">Senior Architect</a>, Lead Technical Lead, Chief Scientist, etc.</p><aside class="quote">They will keep working for you for less money just because you're good friends.</aside><p><strong>Help them survive</strong>. Most programmers are rather stupid when it comes to managing money. They simply don’t know how to buy insurance, how to plan a retirement fund, or even how to pay taxes. You help them, to your own benefit, of course. They will be happy to feel safe in your hands, and won’t leave you. They won’t ask for a raise, either, because they will feel bad about even starting such a negotiation. You must be the “parent,” and they will be the “kids.” It’s a good old model. It works.</p><p><strong>Be a friend</strong>. This is the last and most powerful technique. You have to be a friend to your programmers. It’s very difficult to negotiate money with a friend—they won’t be able to do it easily. They will keep working for you for less money just because you’re good friends. How do you become friends? Well, meet their families, invite them over for dinner at your house, give them birthday gifts—all those tricks. They will save you a lot of money.</p><p>Did I forget anything?</p></p><nav class="buttons notranslate desktop-only"> <a href="http://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://www.yegor256.com/2016/12/06/how-to-pay-programmers-less.html" title="Share on Facebook" class="button" rel="nofollow"> <span class="count count-facebook">0</span> <i class="icon icon-facebook notranslate" aria-hidden="true"></i> </a> <a href="https://twitter.com/share?url=https://www.yegor256.com/2016/12/06/how-to-pay-programmers-less.html&amp;text=How+to+Pay+Programmers+Less" title="Share on Twitter" class="button" rel="nofollow"> <span class="count count-twitter">0</span> <i class="icon icon-twitter notranslate" aria-hidden="true"></i> </a> <a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=https://www.yegor256.com/2016/12/06/how-to-pay-programmers-less.html" title="Share on Google+" class="button" rel="nofollow"> <span class="count count-googleplus">0</span> <i class="icon icon-googleplus notranslate" aria-hidden="true"></i> </a> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/cws/share?url=https://www.yegor256.com/2016/12/06/how-to-pay-programmers-less.html" title="Share on LinkedIn" class="button" rel="nofollow"> <span class="count count-linkedin">0</span> <i class="icon icon-linkedin notranslate" aria-hidden="true"></i> </a> <a href="http://reddit.com/submit?url=https://www.yegor256.com/2016/12/06/how-to-pay-programmers-less.html%3F2016-49&amp;title=How+to+Pay+Programmers+Less" title="Share on Reddit" class="button" rel="nofollow"> <span class="count count-reddit">0</span> <i class="icon icon-reddit notranslate" aria-hidden="true"></i> </a> <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/submitlink?u=https://www.yegor256.com/2016/12/06/how-to-pay-programmers-less.html%3F2016-49&amp;t=How+to+Pay+Programmers+Less" title="Share on Hacker News" class="button" rel="nofollow"> <span class="count count-hackernews">0</span> <i class="icon icon-hackernews notranslate" aria-hidden="true"></i> </a> </nav> </header> <article class="main" itemprop="articleBody"><div ><p>To create software, you need programmers.

I type all my books in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.latex-project.org/&quot;&gt;LaTeX&lt;/a&gt;. To my knowledge, it’s the best and most powerful typesetting software. If you don’t use it yet, you absolutely must read &lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/2fBsTPn&quot;&gt;The TeX Book&lt;/a&gt; by Donald Knuth. Even if you’re not going to become a book writer or publisher, you must read the book. You will enjoy reading and will simply fall in love with TeX. The only problem with TeX is that it formats texts for a fixed page size, unlike HTML and many other digital formats. When I write my books, I know exactly the size of their pages, and everything is formatted to look perfect on paper. I simply don’t know how to do the same for all digital formats. I’m sure it’s possible, but I don’t know how.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Second, there is an emotional reason:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I don’t like digital books&lt;/strong&gt;. Call me old school, but I don’t like to read on screen. I like how books feel, how they smell, and how they become “friends.” I like to make notes, bookmarks, fold pages, etc. I believe what’s very important is not just the content, but the way you “feel” it. With a digital book, this emotional aspect of reading is gone; all books are the same. You don’t feel a book at all, because it’s just a Kindle in your hands. You may say that not everybody is like me. Well, yes, but I want the world to be the way I like it. Not the way it is.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;All other reasons are derived from the fact that a digital book will inevitably be stolen and posted on torrents or somewhere else, for free download. A digital book will become a &lt;em&gt;free&lt;/em&gt; book very quickly.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Let's just agree that a digital book means a free book&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;Let me tell you a funny story. I received an email a few months ago from a “Korean book publisher.” The email said it was very interested in translating &lt;a href=&quot;/elegant-objects.html&quot;&gt;Elegant Objects&lt;/a&gt; into Korean and publishing in its local market. To start the process, the email said, the company needed my book in PDF. I replied that I was ready to send a printed copy, which was definitely enough for a translator to work on. The sender disappeared. I’ve checked its website and found no real evidence of previously published books. I guess it was just a scam, an attempt to get a digital copy of the book. Funny, huh?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thus, let’s just agree that a digital book means a free book at the moment of writing, in this world. And here is why I don’t want my books to be free:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Not only because I'm greedy, but because I want you to take my books seriously&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I want to earn&lt;/strong&gt;. Not only because I need to pay my bills, but mostly because I want to stay motivated. I’ve made almost $12,000 by selling the first volume of &lt;a href=&quot;/elegant-objects.html&quot;&gt;Elegant Objects&lt;/a&gt; over the last 10 months. Do you think I’m motivated enough to write the second volume. Of course I am! Would I be as motivated as I am now if I would have made $500 instead? I don’t think so. Most probably, you would never see any more books from me. And it’s not just about dollars. It’s mostly about the appreciation I feel from you. Every payment I get from Amazon tells me that I definitely deliver something valuable. With a free book, I will get no appreciation and no cash.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I want you to pay&lt;/strong&gt;. Not only because I’m greedy, but mostly because I want you to take my books seriously. As a reader myself, I pay almost no attention to books that cost $1.99 or nothing. I understand that their authors themselves were not serious about them. Why are they cheap or free? They were so easy to write? Their authors don’t believe that anyone would pay any decent money for them? Their authors are afraid of refunds? Probably a combination of all that. I strongly believe that good products must cost good money. If it’s free, it’s bad (or there are some hidden costs or concealed promotion of something else).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Because of all that, you get no digital books.

They were asking about my opinion of the conferences I’ve recently attended. Basically, they were interested to know what I would suggest for improvement. So, I decided to summarize it in a list of the most typical mistakes all conferences keep making and give them some ideas. Remember, I’m judging from a speaker’s position. The most serious mistakes and pieces of advice are at the bottom.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;!--more--&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;jb_picture&quot;&gt;&lt;img itemprop=&quot;image&quot; alt=&quot;Mi gran noche (2015) by Álex de la Iglesia&quot; src=&quot;/images/2016/06/mi-gran-noche.jpg&quot; longdesc=&quot;#02c4598a&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption id=&quot;02c4598a&quot;&gt;Mi gran noche (2015) by Álex de la Iglesia&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Too formal&lt;/strong&gt;. Very often all I’m getting from event organizers is a formal email that my presentation was accepted and then some travel details: “your hotel is here, don’t miss this speaker’s dinner.” That’s it. I don’t know who is behind the conference, what this event is for, etc. At that speaker’s dinner (if I don’t miss it) some details are cleared up. At some conferences, they even communicate with me via some online form and I have to answer there through login/logout. This is rather annoying and turns me off. It would be much better to feel that there is a team with real people, who want to see me as a speaker. I would be way more dedicated and motivated.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Four talks per day is an absolute maximum for a serious listener&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Short breaks&lt;/strong&gt;. Breaks between presentations that are too short give listeners an impression that each particular presentation is not as important as the event as a whole. This really de-motivates me as a speaker. I want to feel valuable. I came to the conference to be heard. I think my speech is the most important and I don’t want people to jump quickly out of the room, just to have enough time to drink coffee and run to the next presentation. 30 minutes between talks is a comfortable time—enough to forget the previous talk and focus on the next one. Also, four talks per day is an absolute maximum for a serious listener.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No moderator&lt;/strong&gt;. There must be someone on the stage who presents the speaker and asks questions if the room is quiet. All academic conferences have that. I don’t understand why most industry events don’t do the same. A speaker must feel comfortable on the stage. Being there alone doesn’t help at all. Also, the moderator will promote me to better engage with the audience.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;I'm not only attending your event, but also associating my name with it&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Boring website&lt;/strong&gt;. The higher the level of the conference, the more modern and beautiful their website has to be. It’s not only your but also my face. I’m not only attending your event, but also associating my name with it. I will share your website on my Twitter, my Facebook, my blog, etc. That’s why I really want it to look cool. Some conferences don’t care about that and this attitude seriously demotivates me as a speaker.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cheap venue&lt;/strong&gt;. This means literally what it says—the place is too cheap and, because of that, bad. The impression of such a place ruins the entire conference. Don’t fool yourself, if it’s cheap—it’s bad. Into this category I would also place venues that are not designed to be conference hosts, like cinemas or offices. They will also be cheaper than proper venues, but you will get what you pay for.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No introduction&lt;/strong&gt;. I believe it’s a job of conference organizers to promote me as a speaker in front of the audience. Not only on the stage, but also online, via Twitter, Facebook, etc. Most conferences don’t do that at all. I come to the stage completely unannounced with almost zero interest from the room. They simply don’t know who I am and why I’m here. The conference must promote us, the speakers, very pro-actively.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Slow WiFi&lt;/strong&gt;. It’s just very annoying.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Just make 5-10 such short intros and I will busy talking to these guys for the whole day&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No networking&lt;/strong&gt;. Conference organizers know all speakers who are attending and most of the listeners. They are at the center of this networking event, but they almost never use that position effectively. They should help me network while I’m there by introducing me to those who I may be interested in. This won’t be hard at all for them. Just tell me “hey, let me introduce you to this guy who is working and speaking about something similar to you.” Just make 5-10 such short intros and I will busy talking to these guys for the whole day. Instead, in most conferences, speakers arrive, speak, drink their coffee and leave. That’s sad.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No video&lt;/strong&gt;. Most conferences don’t record videos and it’s a terrible mistake. They probably think that their events are more important then us, their speakers. It’s not true. I’m speaking in front of 50 people, video recording it on my iPhone, publishing it in my &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCr9qCdqXLm2SU0BIs6d_68Q&quot;&gt;YouTube channel&lt;/a&gt; and getting 500 views in the first week. So, who is more important, your event which was able to attract just 50 people or my YouTube channel that attracted 500? Thus, I would strongly recommend paying a lot of attention to video recording and its quality. Preferably, you should record from two cameras (the speaker and the room) and do video editing afterwards. It’s expensive, but very important.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bad Equipment&lt;/strong&gt;. I mean sound, light, projectors, screens, microphones, etc. It’s very annoying to see how speakers and the audience suffer from all that technical problems.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Too small&lt;/strong&gt;. It’s very difficult to present when there is less than 100 people in the room. According to my experience, only one out of 10-15 people is actually listening and understanding. It’s an average number. Of course, it depends on the subject, but not too much. This means that if there are 30 people in the room, only a few of them are my active listeners. It’s very difficult to present to just a few people. You simply can’t afford to lose their attention, even for a second. With a hundred people, the situation becomes more manageable. There are 8-12 people who are actively listening. Even if I lose a few of them, it’s not a big deal. The best size of the room is 250 people. That’s the ideal audience for a technical talk.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Too big&lt;/strong&gt;. A very big audience (over 500 people in the room) causes another problem—I completely lose any contact with my listeners. I don’t see their eyes any more. I can’t see their reaction, I don’t understand whether they follow me or not. I’m not a technical speaker any more, but a rock singer. All I can do is turn my presentation into a show and play with their emotions, not their brains. This is actually what most &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/05/10/keynote-clowns.html&quot;&gt;keynote speakers&lt;/a&gt; are usually doing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;A perfect conference must have one track, a room for 250-300 listeners, and a very well selected list of speakers&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Too many tracks&lt;/strong&gt;. Honestly, I think that the very idea of having multiple tracks is very bad. I want the entire conference to attend my talk. I don’t want to lose anyone. Moreover, I don’t want to compete with some &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/05/10/keynote-clowns.html&quot;&gt;clown&lt;/a&gt; (no offense to clowns) just because he is speaking at the same time. It’s a very demotivating competition, since I can’t do anything to win. I want to feel that I’m speaking here because there is some value in my information. I want to know that I’m the chosen one. And I want to feel that conference attendees feel the same. A perfect conference must have one track, a room for 250-300 listeners, and a very well selected list of speakers. I believe that most conferences are shooting themselves in the foot trying to please the audience by inviting too many speakers. Instead, do your homework right—select the best speakers and don’t make listeners walk from track to track cursing you for the mediocre speeches. Choosing speakers is your job! Don’t delegate it to your audience.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;hr /&gt; &lt;p&gt;Did I forget anything?

I’m not only attending your event, but also associating my name with it. I will share your website on my Twitter, my Facebook, my blog, etc. That’s why I really want it to look cool. Some conferences don’t care about that and this attitude seriously demotivates me as a speaker.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cheap venue&lt;/strong&gt;. This means literally what it says—the place is too cheap and, because of that, bad. The impression of such a place ruins the entire conference. Don’t fool yourself, if it’s cheap—it’s bad. Into this category I would also place venues that are not designed to be conference hosts, like cinemas or offices. They will also be cheaper than proper venues, but you will get what you pay for.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No introduction&lt;/strong&gt;. I believe it’s a job of conference organizers to promote me as a speaker in front of the audience. Not only on the stage, but also online, via Twitter, Facebook, etc. Most conferences don’t do that at all. I come to the stage completely unannounced with almost zero interest from the room. They simply don’t know who I am and why I’m here. The conference must promote us, the speakers, very pro-actively.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Slow WiFi&lt;/strong&gt;. It’s just very annoying.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Just make 5-10 such short intros and I will busy talking to these guys for the whole day&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No networking&lt;/strong&gt;. Conference organizers know all speakers who are attending and most of the listeners. They are at the center of this networking event, but they almost never use that position effectively. They should help me network while I’m there by introducing me to those who I may be interested in. This won’t be hard at all for them. Just tell me “hey, let me introduce you to this guy who is working and speaking about something similar to you.” Just make 5-10 such short intros and I will busy talking to these guys for the whole day. Instead, in most conferences, speakers arrive, speak, drink their coffee and leave. That’s sad.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No video&lt;/strong&gt;. Most conferences don’t record videos and it’s a terrible mistake. They probably think that their events are more important then us, their speakers. It’s not true. I’m speaking in front of 50 people, video recording it on my iPhone, publishing it in my &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCr9qCdqXLm2SU0BIs6d_68Q&quot;&gt;YouTube channel&lt;/a&gt; and getting 500 views in the first week. So, who is more important, your event which was able to attract just 50 people or my YouTube channel that attracted 500? Thus, I would strongly recommend paying a lot of attention to video recording and its quality. Preferably, you should record from two cameras (the speaker and the room) and do video editing afterwards. It’s expensive, but very important.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bad Equipment&lt;/strong&gt;. I mean sound, light, projectors, screens, microphones, etc. It’s very annoying to see how speakers and the audience suffer from all that technical problems.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Too small&lt;/strong&gt;. It’s very difficult to present when there is less than 100 people in the room. According to my experience, only one out of 10-15 people is actually listening and understanding. It’s an average number. Of course, it depends on the subject, but not too much. This means that if there are 30 people in the room, only a few of them are my active listeners. It’s very difficult to present to just a few people. You simply can’t afford to lose their attention, even for a second. With a hundred people, the situation becomes more manageable. There are 8-12 people who are actively listening. Even if I lose a few of them, it’s not a big deal. The best size of the room is 250 people. That’s the ideal audience for a technical talk.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Too big&lt;/strong&gt;. A very big audience (over 500 people in the room) causes another problem—I completely lose any contact with my listeners. I don’t see their eyes any more. I can’t see their reaction, I don’t understand whether they follow me or not. I’m not a technical speaker any more, but a rock singer. All I can do is turn my presentation into a show and play with their emotions, not their brains. This is actually what most &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/05/10/keynote-clowns.html&quot;&gt;keynote speakers&lt;/a&gt; are usually doing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;A perfect conference must have one track, a room for 250-300 listeners, and a very well selected list of speakers&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Too many tracks&lt;/strong&gt;. Honestly, I think that the very idea of having multiple tracks is very bad. I want the entire conference to attend my talk. I don’t want to lose anyone. Moreover, I don’t want to compete with some &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/05/10/keynote-clowns.html&quot;&gt;clown&lt;/a&gt; (no offense to clowns) just because he is speaking at the same time. It’s a very demotivating competition, since I can’t do anything to win. I want to feel that I’m speaking here because there is some value in my information. I want to know that I’m the chosen one. And I want to feel that conference attendees feel the same. A perfect conference must have one track, a room for 250-300 listeners, and a very well selected list of speakers. I believe that most conferences are shooting themselves in the foot trying to please the audience by inviting too many speakers. Instead, do your homework right—select the best speakers and don’t make listeners walk from track to track cursing you for the mediocre speeches. Choosing speakers is your job! Don’t delegate it to your audience.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;hr /&gt; &lt;p&gt;Did I forget anything?

who were software conference organizers. They were asking about my opinion of the conferences I’ve recently attended. Basically, they were interested to know what I would suggest for improvement. So, I decided to summarize it in a list of the most typical mistakes all conferences keep making and give them some ideas. Remember, I’m judging from a speaker’s position. The most serious mistakes and pieces of advice are at the bottom.</p><figure class="jb_picture"><img itemprop="image" alt="Mi gran noche (2015) by Álex de la Iglesia" src="/images/2016/06/mi-gran-noche.jpg" longdesc="#02c4598a" /><figcaption id="02c4598a">Mi gran noche (2015) by Álex de la Iglesia</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Too formal</strong>. Very often all I’m getting from event organizers is a formal email that my presentation was accepted and then some travel details: “your hotel is here, don’t miss this speaker’s dinner.” That’s it. I don’t know who is behind the conference, what this event is for, etc. At that speaker’s dinner (if I don’t miss it) some details are cleared up. At some conferences, they even communicate with me via some online form and I have to answer there through login/logout. This is rather annoying and turns me off. It would be much better to feel that there is a team with real people, who want to see me as a speaker. I would be way more dedicated and motivated.</p><aside class="quote">Four talks per day is an absolute maximum for a serious listener</aside><p><strong>Short breaks</strong>. Breaks between presentations that are too short give listeners an impression that each particular presentation is not as important as the event as a whole. This really de-motivates me as a speaker. I want to feel valuable. I came to the conference to be heard. I think my speech is the most important and I don’t want people to jump quickly out of the room, just to have enough time to drink coffee and run to the next presentation. 30 minutes between talks is a comfortable time—enough to forget the previous talk and focus on the next one. Also, four talks per day is an absolute maximum for a serious listener.</p><p><strong>No moderator</strong>. There must be someone on the stage who presents the speaker and asks questions if the room is quiet. All academic conferences have that. I don’t understand why most industry events don’t do the same. A speaker must feel comfortable on the stage. Being there alone doesn’t help at all. Also, the moderator will promote me to better engage with the audience.</p><aside class="quote">I'm not only attending your event, but also associating my name with it</aside><p><strong>Boring website</strong>.

They will also be cheaper than proper venues, but you will get what you pay for.</p><p><strong>No introduction</strong>. I believe it’s a job of conference organizers to promote me as a speaker in front of the audience. Not only on the stage, but also online, via Twitter, Facebook, etc. Most conferences don’t do that at all. I come to the stage completely unannounced with almost zero interest from the room. They simply don’t know who I am and why I’m here. The conference must promote us, the speakers, very pro-actively.</p><p><strong>Slow WiFi</strong>. It’s just very annoying.</p><aside class="quote">Just make 5-10 such short intros and I will busy talking to these guys for the whole day</aside><p><strong>No networking</strong>. Conference organizers know all speakers who are attending and most of the listeners. They are at the center of this networking event, but they almost never use that position effectively. They should help me network while I’m there by introducing me to those who I may be interested in. This won’t be hard at all for them. Just tell me “hey, let me introduce you to this guy who is working and speaking about something similar to you.” Just make 5-10 such short intros and I will busy talking to these guys for the whole day. Instead, in most conferences, speakers arrive, speak, drink their coffee and leave. That’s sad.</p><p><strong>No video</strong>. Most conferences don’t record videos and it’s a terrible mistake. They probably think that their events are more important then us, their speakers. It’s not true. I’m speaking in front of 50 people, video recording it on my iPhone, publishing it in my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCr9qCdqXLm2SU0BIs6d_68Q">YouTube channel</a> and getting 500 views in the first week. So, who is more important, your event which was able to attract just 50 people or my YouTube channel that attracted 500? Thus, I would strongly recommend paying a lot of attention to video recording and its quality. Preferably, you should record from two cameras (the speaker and the room) and do video editing afterwards. It’s expensive, but very important.</p><p><strong>Bad Equipment</strong>. I mean sound, light, projectors, screens, microphones, etc. It’s very annoying to see how speakers and the audience suffer from all that technical problems.</p><p><strong>Too small</strong>. It’s very difficult to present when there is less than 100 people in the room. According to my experience, only one out of 10-15 people is actually listening and understanding. It’s an average number. Of course, it depends on the subject, but not too much. This means that if there are 30 people in the room, only a few of them are my active listeners. It’s very difficult to present to just a few people. You simply can’t afford to lose their attention, even for a second. With a hundred people, the situation becomes more manageable. There are 8-12 people who are actively listening. Even if I lose a few of them, it’s not a big deal. The best size of the room is 250 people. That’s the ideal audience for a technical talk.</p><p><strong>Too big</strong>. A very big audience (over 500 people in the room) causes another problem—I completely lose any contact with my listeners. I don’t see their eyes any more. I can’t see their reaction, I don’t understand whether they follow me or not. I’m not a technical speaker any more, but a rock singer. All I can do is turn my presentation into a show and play with their emotions, not their brains. This is actually what most <a href="/2016/05/10/keynote-clowns.html">keynote speakers</a> are usually doing.</p><aside class="quote">A perfect conference must have one track, a room for 250-300 listeners, and a very well selected list of speakers</aside><p><strong>Too many tracks</strong>. Honestly, I think that the very idea of having multiple tracks is very bad. I want the entire conference to attend my talk. I don’t want to lose anyone. Moreover, I don’t want to compete with some <a href="/2016/05/10/keynote-clowns.html">clown</a> (no offense to clowns) just because he is speaking at the same time. It’s a very demotivating competition, since I can’t do anything to win. I want to feel that I’m speaking here because there is some value in my information. I want to know that I’m the chosen one. And I want to feel that conference attendees feel the same. A perfect conference must have one track, a room for 250-300 listeners, and a very well selected list of speakers. I believe that most conferences are shooting themselves in the foot trying to please the audience by inviting too many speakers. Instead, do your homework right—select the best speakers and don’t make listeners walk from track to track cursing you for the mediocre speeches. Choosing speakers is your job! Don’t delegate it to your audience.</p><hr /><p>Did I forget anything?

It’s risky and some people may disagree with you. That’s not good. The goal is to have everybody in the room completely agree with what you’re saying. That’s how you make a good speech. The audience will be comfortable and relaxed, and you will have no risk of being questioned afterwards. A few safe headline examples: “trust is very important” or “software must be stable.” Everybody will be nodding their heads—that’s all you need.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Joke!&lt;/strong&gt; You must make them laugh. You must open with a joke and continue with many of them. Prepare them carefully. Just Google “good keynote jokes” and use what smart people recommend. A well-prepared collection of jokes is much more valuable than the content you will be talking about. Nobody will remember the content, but the jokes will definitely be re-tweeted. When a good speaker is talking, the room is laughing every 60 seconds.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;A well-prepared collection of jokes is much more valuable than the content you will be talking about.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Swear!&lt;/strong&gt; Don’t be too formal and boring, show a slide with a picture of a naked butt every once in a while. Everybody will understand that you’re not only a speaker but also a good friend. Also, your language should be rather loose. Pretend you’re talking to a friend over a pint of beer. Remember, the goal is to be funny.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Repeat!&lt;/strong&gt; Always bring the same content with you, to all &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/06/03/conference-mistakes.html&quot;&gt;conferences&lt;/a&gt;. It’s easier for everybody. First, conference organizers will know for sure what will you be talking about. They can even watch your 4-year-old video-recorded presentation and see exactly what words and slides you’re planning to use. Second, you won’t be nervous, since you’ll be saying the same jokes over and over again. Everybody wins.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kitties!&lt;/strong&gt; Cute kitties. We all love them! Attach them somehow to your content. It is not really important whether they are related or not. You must show love.

It has to be something sweet and adorable.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keep talking!&lt;/strong&gt; A good keynote speech fills the entire 60 minutes, leaving absolutely no time for questions. Actually, a perfect speaker will be interrupted after the 145th slide and will say that if anyone wants to know more, there is always a place near the restroom, let’s go there and continue. Thus, be focused on your slides and try to avoid questions at the end—they may create a negative impression of you if you mess up answering their questions. They came to listen to you, not to ask questions—keep talking.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;hr /&gt; &lt;p&gt;On a more serious note, I’m very disappointed by what I’ve seen in almost all conferences so far.

They make $2-3K a speech and we, the listeners, get absolutely nothing new out of them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Conference organizers keep inviting them, just because of the names. And we keep attending that conferences also just because of the names. But do these names really mean anything? I don’t think so.

I think the problem is bigger.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;!--more--&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;jb_picture&quot;&gt;&lt;img itemprop=&quot;image&quot; alt=&quot;Cossacks of the Kuban (1950) by Ivan Pyryev&quot; src=&quot;/images/2015/10/cossacks-of-the-kuban.jpg&quot; longdesc=&quot;#20e3be03&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption id=&quot;20e3be03&quot;&gt;Cossacks of the Kuban (1950) by Ivan Pyryev&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Have any of you seen this movie: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0041562/&quot;&gt;Cossacks of the Kuban&lt;/a&gt;? It was shot in 1949, when &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stalin&quot;&gt;Joseph Stalin&lt;/a&gt; was in power, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union&quot;&gt;Soviet Union&lt;/a&gt; was literally broke, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II&quot;&gt;WWII&lt;/a&gt; brought people to the point of &lt;strong&gt;starvation&lt;/strong&gt;. However, the film showed something completely opposite—wealthy villages, rich peasants, and tables full of food.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It was &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propaganda&quot;&gt;propaganda&lt;/a&gt; in 1949.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But isn’t it quite similar to what I’ve just seen a few days ago, produced and directed in 2015 by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000631/&quot;&gt;Ridley Scott&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;badge&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.yegor256.com/images/2015/10/ussr-symbol.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width:128px;max-width:100%;&quot; alt=&quot;badge&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;In 1949, the goal of Soviet propaganda was to convince people that their personal situations with a lack of food and lack of future were just their local, personal &lt;strong&gt;exceptions&lt;/strong&gt; to a more general rule. And that rule was that the country was full of food. The country was governed by the principles of socialism, and they were working perfectly.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In 2015, the goal of Hollywood propaganda is to convince us that the organizational and motivational problems in our &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/10/06/how-to-be-good-office-slave.html&quot;&gt;offices&lt;/a&gt; are just local exceptions to the general rule. The rule is simple: project management is not important if we’re all good friends.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;The truth is that you are not going to get anywhere if you follow the spirit of this movie&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ridley Scott is telling us that in a perfect organization, such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nasa.gov/&quot;&gt;NASA&lt;/a&gt;, everybody &lt;strong&gt;loves&lt;/strong&gt; everyone; that’s why they can get a man from Mars without even a map. Do the same in your company and you will be fine. You don’t need risk planning, you just need a hero. Actually, you’d be better off with a couple of heroes who love each other.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That doesn’t work for you? It must be a problem with implementation. Keep trying and smiling.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Make friends, don’t make plans.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is a lie, very similar to the lie we heard in 1949.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The truth is that you are not going to get anywhere if you follow the spirit of this movie. In reality, teamwork must look completely different. There are &lt;a href=&quot;/2017/01/03/how-much-you-love-conflicts.html&quot;&gt;conflicts&lt;/a&gt;, fights, politics, betrayals, back-stabbing, leakage of information, and just primitive incompetence. To manage all this, one can’t just be a &lt;strong&gt;nice guy&lt;/strong&gt; with a big heart. I would even say that being a nice guy is a drawback for any management position in a modern organization. Well, in any organization at any time and in any place.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Project management is &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/03/02/team-morale-myths-and-reality.html&quot;&gt;not&lt;/a&gt; about compassion and sympathy. It is about accurate and routine comparison of risks, probabilities, impacts, and their mitigation plans. It is about &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/09/22/micromanagement.html&quot;&gt;setting rules&lt;/a&gt; and making &lt;strong&gt;decisions&lt;/strong&gt;. It is about making sure these decisions are being executed, precisely and without mistakes. It is about &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/09/16/how-to-fire-someone-right.html&quot;&gt;making sure&lt;/a&gt; those who’ve made mistakes are &lt;strong&gt;punished&lt;/strong&gt; while those who’ve done everything right are &lt;strong&gt;rewarded&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A team of six. In a multi-million-dollar spaceship. Flying to another planet to save one person. Against explicit instructions from upper management. They come back as national heroes. Are you serious?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Have you tried to deploy a new feature on a production server against the direct will of your boss? Try it. No spaceships, no Mars. Just a piece of code and a simple server. Then try to convince your boss that you’re a hero.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I’m sure you get the point.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;picture&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.popsci.com/sites/popsci.com/files/styles/large_1x_/public/psc1015_mt_088.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width:600px;max-width:100%;&quot; alt=&quot;Shooting The Martian (by popsci.com)&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Shooting The Martian (by popsci.com)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;So, why is Ridley Scott &lt;strong&gt;lying&lt;/strong&gt; to us? Why is he giving us a false picture of reality? Intentionally &lt;strong&gt;false&lt;/strong&gt;. He knows better than I do how real management works in real-life organizations. Hollywood is not much different than Silicon Valley in this aspect. So, why is he lying?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;badge&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Germany&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.yegor256.com/images/2015/10/third-reich-symbol.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width:128px;max-width:100%;&quot; alt=&quot;badge&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Why was &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Goebbels&quot;&gt;Joseph Goebbels&lt;/a&gt;, a minister of propaganda in the Third Reich, lying to the German people?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Because that’s what we like to hear, &lt;strong&gt;unfortunately&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is sad, but we don’t want to know the truth. We didn’t want to know about Nazi war crimes—so Joseph Goebbels built a &lt;strong&gt;fake&lt;/strong&gt; reality for us. We don’t want to know about the true principles of management—so Ridley Scott built fake ones for us.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Think about it.&lt;/p&gt; " /> <meta name="keywords" content="next, path, output, content, previous, url, relative_path, id, collection, excerpt, draft, categories, layout, title, date, place, tags, description, keywords, image, jb_picture, slug, ext" /> <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1"/> <meta name="google-site-verification" content="JEj_gQr2CPe2QKGw8XdMz0R7VboQIUbX3FlM-lwTq-8" /> <meta name="author" content="Yegor Bugayenko"> <meta name="article:published_time" content="2015-10-16 00:00:00 +0000"> <meta name="og:site_name" content="Yegor Bugayenko"/> <meta name="og:type" content="article" /> <meta name="og:locale" content="en_US" /> <meta name="twitter:account_id" content="4503599630178231" /> <meta name="twitter:creator" content="@yegor256"/> <meta name="twitter:site" content="@yegor256"/> <meta name="twitter:title" property="og:title" content="What Is the Difference Between Ridley Scott and Joseph Goebbels?"/> <meta name="twitter:description" property="og:description" content="&lt;p&gt;I saw &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3659388/&quot;&gt;The Martian&lt;/a&gt; this weekend, and it triggered a few thoughts.

Keep trying and smiling.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Make friends, don’t make plans.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is a lie, very similar to the lie we heard in 1949.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The truth is that you are not going to get anywhere if you follow the spirit of this movie. In reality, teamwork must look completely different. There are &lt;a href=&quot;/2017/01/03/how-much-you-love-conflicts.html&quot;&gt;conflicts&lt;/a&gt;, fights, politics, betrayals, back-stabbing, leakage of information, and just primitive incompetence. To manage all this, one can’t just be a &lt;strong&gt;nice guy&lt;/strong&gt; with a big heart. I would even say that being a nice guy is a drawback for any management position in a modern organization. Well, in any organization at any time and in any place.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Project management is &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/03/02/team-morale-myths-and-reality.html&quot;&gt;not&lt;/a&gt; about compassion and sympathy. It is about accurate and routine comparison of risks, probabilities, impacts, and their mitigation plans. It is about &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/09/22/micromanagement.html&quot;&gt;setting rules&lt;/a&gt; and making &lt;strong&gt;decisions&lt;/strong&gt;. It is about making sure these decisions are being executed, precisely and without mistakes. It is about &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/09/16/how-to-fire-someone-right.html&quot;&gt;making sure&lt;/a&gt; those who’ve made mistakes are &lt;strong&gt;punished&lt;/strong&gt; while those who’ve done everything right are &lt;strong&gt;rewarded&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A team of six. In a multi-million-dollar spaceship. Flying to another planet to save one person. Against explicit instructions from upper management. They come back as national heroes. Are you serious?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Have you tried to deploy a new feature on a production server against the direct will of your boss? Try it. No spaceships, no Mars. Just a piece of code and a simple server. Then try to convince your boss that you’re a hero.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I’m sure you get the point.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;picture&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.popsci.com/sites/popsci.com/files/styles/large_1x_/public/psc1015_mt_088.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width:600px;max-width:100%;&quot; alt=&quot;Shooting The Martian (by popsci.com)&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Shooting The Martian (by popsci.com)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;So, why is Ridley Scott &lt;strong&gt;lying&lt;/strong&gt; to us? Why is he giving us a false picture of reality? Intentionally &lt;strong&gt;false&lt;/strong&gt;. He knows better than I do how real management works in real-life organizations. Hollywood is not much different than Silicon Valley in this aspect. So, why is he lying?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;badge&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Germany&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.yegor256.com/images/2015/10/third-reich-symbol.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width:128px;max-width:100%;&quot; alt=&quot;badge&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Why was &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Goebbels&quot;&gt;Joseph Goebbels&lt;/a&gt;, a minister of propaganda in the Third Reich, lying to the German people?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Because that’s what we like to hear, &lt;strong&gt;unfortunately&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is sad, but we don’t want to know the truth. We didn’t want to know about Nazi war crimes—so Joseph Goebbels built a &lt;strong&gt;fake&lt;/strong&gt; reality for us. We don’t want to know about the true principles of management—so Ridley Scott built fake ones for us.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Think about it.&lt;/p&gt; "/> <meta name="twitter:url" property="og:url"

I second that. Producers, &lt;a href=&quot;/2017/02/21/say-no-to-google-recruiters.html&quot;&gt;recruiters&lt;/a&gt;, managers, real estate agents, sales agents, lawyers, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://english.stackexchange.com/questions/103448/is-outstaffing-a-real-word&quot;&gt;outstaffers&lt;/a&gt;—what do they all have in common?

To find a programmer, one has to pay about $30K (in Silicon Valley, if a programmer’s salary is, say, $120K a year) to a recruiter. $30,000! What will this money be spent on? Or let me put it this way: How much software will I get for this money? Let me put it even better: Why don’t I give this money to the programmer directly as a bonus for switching companies? Why do &lt;strong&gt;we&lt;/strong&gt; need this &lt;a href=&quot;/2017/02/21/say-no-to-google-recruiters.html&quot;&gt;recruiter&lt;/a&gt; between us—me and the programmer I’m going to hire? Can’t we use this $30,000 more effectively?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Because software systems are not powerful enough yet? Because I can’t find a programmer with a few clicks and I have to delegate this search function to someone for $30K?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Well, yes and no.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;IT recruiters stay between us, stealing our money and protecting that position for themselves&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;On one hand, there are plenty of job sites and rather powerful technologies for finding the right person. There is &lt;a href=&quot;https://careers.stackoverflow.com/&quot;&gt;StackOverflow Careers&lt;/a&gt;, which not only allows me to find a programmer but also see what he or she talks about and the quality of his or her questions and answers. There is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.github.com&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; that demonstrates the code written by a programmer, helping me easily understand its quality. There are professional certifications that show how strong a candidate’s skills are. And there are plenty of other avenues.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On the other hand, these tools are not actively used by the majority of programmers and software companies—mostly because &lt;a href=&quot;/2017/02/21/say-no-to-google-recruiters.html&quot;&gt;IT recruiters&lt;/a&gt; stay between us, &lt;strong&gt;stealing&lt;/strong&gt; our money and protecting that position for themselves. Just like taxi companies remain between passengers and drivers, or real estate agents get in between house owners and house buyers, or &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/10/27/outsourcing-doesnt-work.html&quot;&gt;outstaffing companies&lt;/a&gt; squeeze in the middle of project sponsors and engineers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Imagine if there was no Google and you had to hire a “researcher” every time you needed to find some information. That’s how it worked 50 years ago. Not anymore. Google solved the problem of information discovery. It is fast, it is accurate, and it is free. The researchers are out of business. Are we sorry about it? Well, maybe, but that’s the way it should be. The same will happen with IT recruiters and all those “agents.” They will eventually be out of business and will start doing something that actually adds &lt;strong&gt;some value&lt;/strong&gt; for all of us.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At the moment, they are simply taking away our money, &lt;strong&gt;exploiting&lt;/strong&gt; the fact that we’re lazy, or stupid, or shy, or you name it. For example, it was not obvious in the beginning how to use Google. I know a few people who still don’t know how to do it. I’m sure you know a few, too. They would rather call a friend when they need information than pull up Google.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Say I’m a good friend and Jeff calls me to ask what the weather will be like tomorrow in California. I’ll advise him to Google it, now and every time in the future. I will teach him how to do it. But if I was a lousy friend and wanted Jeff to depend on me forever, I would just browse over to Google, check the weather, and tell Jeff it’ll be cloudy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That’s exactly what recruiters are doing. Their entire business is based on the fact that we’re &lt;strong&gt;not smart&lt;/strong&gt; enough to use existing software systems, publicly available and in most cases very cheap or simply free. Or we’re &lt;strong&gt;too shy&lt;/strong&gt; to apply for a new job ourselves. Or we just &lt;strong&gt;don’t know&lt;/strong&gt; how to write a &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/03/08/pimp-up-your-resume.html&quot;&gt;good resume&lt;/a&gt; and emphasize our skills properly. They are exploiting our weaknesses to make money.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A friend of mine was looking for a house in San Francisco a few months ago. He actually found the house on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.zillow.com&quot;&gt;Zillow&lt;/a&gt; but paid $70,000 to two real estate agents to help him close the deal (the price of the house was close to $1.4 million, with 2.5 percent to each agent). What did these “hard-working” people do to earn his $70,000? They prepared the necessary paperwork and, of course, talked to him for a few weeks.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Can’t we get rid of these two good-for-nothings and delegate their operations to a computer system? Well, we have Zillow, but how much of my friend’s $70,000 found its way to Zillow? Almost nothing (I assume one of the agents paid a few pennies to publish an ad there). Is that fair? Let’s instead give $5,000 out of every real estate transaction to Zillow and let it handle everything, automatically. Without any “agents” involved. Can we? I’m sure we can, and that’s the future.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What will the army of real estate agents do? Well, maybe something useful, like &lt;strong&gt;cleaning streets&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;$25 out of my $40 will be spent not writing code but rather on something else&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;The very existence of this mayonnaise in our modern business environment is a very negative thing. Money is simply not working the way it should. Also, since this mayonnaise is rather expensive, its existence creates a very de-motivating effect on those who are actually delivering value while making a much smaller income. It obviously demonstrates that the entire system is defective and simply not fair.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The same is true about &lt;strong&gt;outstaffing&lt;/strong&gt; companies, which we contract with to gain access to programmers sitting somewhere overseas or much closer. They find developers, hire them full-time, and resell their skills with a 150 percent or greater margin on a part-time or short-term basis. I’ve been getting a few offers from such companies every day.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They want me to pay, say, $40 for each hour while a developer sitting in their &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/10/06/how-to-be-good-office-slave.html&quot;&gt;office&lt;/a&gt; gets like $2,500 per month. This means $25 out of my $40 will be spent &lt;strong&gt;not writing code&lt;/strong&gt; but rather on something else. Also, a programmer will be motivated for the $2,500, not for $7,000. So I will be paying $7K per month and getting software worth $2,500 a month.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I will be paying for a Mercedes-Benz S-Class but getting a Ford Focus. I’m not greedy; I just want my every dollar to be converted into some value. In this scenario, $4,500 will be simply wasted.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The same is true about every single middleman in the market. They make business processes less effective, take away significant amounts of money, and slow down optimizations and innovations. A truly modern and innovative way of doing business is by &lt;strong&gt;directly connecting money and people&lt;/strong&gt; who add value. There should be no one in between except computer systems.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sometimes I hear the comment that people love to work with people, not computers. That’s why we need all that mayonnaise—to make our life &lt;strong&gt;happier&lt;/strong&gt;? It’s true that people love to deal with people—people we really need, people who speak the same language, and people who deliver &lt;strong&gt;real value&lt;/strong&gt;. Not with producers, recruiters, real estate agents, sales agents, outstaffers, lawyers, travel agents, investment brokers, executive officers, or taxi dispatchers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The point of Bruce Willis’s character is that when the sandwich is bad you don’t fix it with a mayonnaise. It won’t help, but only make things worse.&lt;/p&gt; " /> <meta name="keywords" content="next, path, output, content, previous, url, relative_path, id, collection, excerpt, draft, categories, layout, title, date, place, tags, description, keywords, image, jb_picture, slug, ext" /> <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1"/> <meta name="google-site-verification" content="JEj_gQr2CPe2QKGw8XdMz0R7VboQIUbX3FlM-lwTq-8" /> <meta name="author" content="Yegor Bugayenko"> <meta name="article:published_time" content="2015-09-29 00:00:00 +0000"> <meta name="og:site_name" content="Yegor Bugayenko"/> <meta name="og:type" content="article" /> <meta name="og:locale" content="en_US" /> <meta name="twitter:account_id" content="4503599630178231" /> <meta name="twitter:creator" content="@yegor256"/> <meta name="twitter:site" content="@yegor256"/> <meta name="twitter:title" property="og:title" content="You're Just the Mayonnaise in a Bad Sandwich"/> <meta name="twitter:description" property="og:description" content="&lt;p&gt;That’s what a character played by actor Bruce Willis said to Robert DeNiro’s movie producer character in Barry Levinson’s brilliant film &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0486674/&quot;&gt;What Just Happened&lt;/a&gt;.

He also offered me many types of shampoo and a cup of tea. All this reminded me of the work we do as programmers, and I decided to write a short post about it. I’ve already <a href="/2015/01/26/happy-boss-false-objective.html">mentioned before</a> that trying to make a customer happy is a false objective. This hairdresser was a perfect illustrative example of this very mistake. By the way, in the end, I wasn’t happy, and he got no tip. How could this happen if he was so friendly and nice?</p><figure class="jb_picture"><img itemprop="image" alt="The Man Who Wasn&#39;t There (2001) by Coen Brothers" src="/images/2015/02/the-man-who-wasnt-there.jpg" longdesc="#243d0d7c" /><figcaption id="243d0d7c">The Man Who Wasn&#39;t There (2001) by Coen Brothers</figcaption></figure><p>I’m not a hairdresser, and I have very little understanding of how to deal with hair. I came to him because I assumed he knew more about this business than I did. I chose him through the assistance of Yelp. I wanted <em>him</em> to tell me how long the hair on the sides should be and how much should be removed on the top. I expected <em>him</em> to give me his professional judgment and stand by it.</p><p>Instead of asking me how much I wanted removed on the sides, he should have told me there should be less on the sides. This is what a true professional would do. A true professional would give me <em>his</em> vision of the haircut that best suits me and would try to convince me that it was the best choice.</p><aside class="quote">He tried to please me. In the end, he lost.</aside><p>A true professional would not ask me but would <em>tell</em> me instead, because he would understand that my goal was not to boss him around and make him do my hair the way I wanted it. My goal was to get the best out of his professional skill.</p><p>Unfortunately, the guy was either weak or immature. He didn’t argue with me and didn’t try to convince me. He tried to <em>please</em> me. In the end, he lost.</p><p>Exactly the same thing happens when we ask our customers about the technologies they want us to use. I hear this question very often: <em>What language do you want us to use</em> (meaning Java or Ruby or something else)? Or <em>what database should we use?</em> Or <em>how do you want us to design this?</em></p><p>Don’t do that. Don’t lose like that hairdresser. Don’t ask your clients what they want. Instead, <em>learn</em> their business requirements and then <em>suggest</em> the solution you think is the best for them. Then, insist and argue if they don’t agree. <a href="/2016/07/21/convince-me.html">Convince</a> them.
