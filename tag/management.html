Phew!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Do you really understand exactly what these words mean? I don’t.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I would actually suggest we replace them all with the “do the right thing” mantra and call it a day.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Smiling in the office and not cursing at a stupid boss helps, but this is not what soft skills are about.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;I have my own list of soft skills though. I also &lt;a href=&quot;/2018/01/23/sociotech-skills.html&quot;&gt;strongly believe&lt;/a&gt; that tech skills are just a small part of what makes a good programmer, but being empathical and ready to learn is not what the other part consists of. Of course, smiling in the office and not cursing at a stupid boss—helps. But this is not what soft skills are about.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They are about our ability to &lt;em&gt;exchange&lt;/em&gt; deliverables. Tech skills produce deliverables, soft skills turn them into a final product, which is working software. Here is a short list, in no particular order:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drawing&lt;/strong&gt;. Talking works great when you’re discussing your next vacation with your partner. In a software team your ability to explain your thoughts with a diagram seriously increases your usefulness.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Writing&lt;/strong&gt;. Again, talking is great, when your chaotic team is being managed by an hysterical boss who just read a book about unconditional love. In a more disciplined environment your ability to put your thoughts in writing do make a difference for mutual success.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reporting&lt;/strong&gt;. A good programmer knows not only how to fix a bug but, more importantly, how to report it &lt;a href=&quot;/2018/04/24/right-way-to-report-bugs.html&quot;&gt;the right way&lt;/a&gt;, so that the project benefits. An ability to describe a technical problem in simple words is a crucial soft skill.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Volunteering&lt;/strong&gt;. Open source is an important part of any software project. You have to know how to work with an open source community, by giving them something back for the software they provide. Sometimes you will have to report problems to them, sometimes even submit pull requests, and maybe even create your own open source products. You will need a lot of non-tech skills to do that.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Charging&lt;/strong&gt;. Programmers make money by writing code. Very often projects fail because important people quit due to a money conflict. They don’t know how to resolve that, how to manage their financial objectives, how to ask for a raise, or how to change the paying schedule. I blame programmers for that. We, technical people, have to know how to manage our financial relationship with our projects.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Relaxing&lt;/strong&gt;. Many projects fail because its programmers burn out. This happens, very often, because they don’t know how to manage their time right: when to work and when to relax. Again, I blame programmers. We have to know how to manage our own peace of mind.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Asking&lt;/strong&gt;. Not your friends, but StackOverflow and other public sources. The software development world is getting global and the knowledge your project team possess is just a tiny fraction of what the world knows about the problem you are solving. You have to know how to ask the world. This is the soft skill you need to have to be a good developer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tweeting&lt;/strong&gt;. Here comes your ability to share your thoughts and achievements in social networks. If you stay mute and net-social-phobic, you are not really helping your project. This is the skill you won’t learn in a few days. I would suggest you take a look at my &lt;a href=&quot;/256-bloghacks.html&quot;&gt;256 Bloghacks&lt;/a&gt; book.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Testing&lt;/strong&gt;. Here I mean not only writing automated tests, which is a tech skill, but an ability to communicate with testers, to make sure their feedback improves the quality of the software under development. There is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378720613000967&quot;&gt;well known&lt;/a&gt; developer-tester conflict, which good programmers know how to deal with.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Still working in a single master branch? Still an amateur.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Branching&lt;/strong&gt;. Still working in a single &lt;code&gt;master&lt;/code&gt; branch? Still an amateur. You have to learn how to use multiple branches, how to resolve conflicts between them, and what is the difference between merge and rebase. This is a soft skill, since it doesn’t have anything to do with the quality of your code but it seriously affects your professionalism as a software developer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Failing&lt;/strong&gt;. Most projects fail, one way or another. Technical failures are not the primary source of our troubles. We fail due to management incompetence most frequently. Good programmers know how to deal with failures, by provoking (aka Fail Fast), predicting (aka Risk Management), and embracing them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Delivering&lt;/strong&gt;. Continuous integration, delivery pipeline, build automation, staging, green/blue deployments, etc.—if you think that all these things concern the DevOps department only, you are wrong. You have to understand how your lines of code reach your users. The bigger the product, the longer the pipeline, the more people it involves, and the more soft skills it requires to be smooth.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Intriguing&lt;/strong&gt;. Any project is a part of a bigger political game, one way or the other. If you isolate yourself from intrigue, claiming that your job is to write code—you are not a good programmer. A good programmer understands where the money is coming from, who the primary shareholders are, and which ass to kiss and when.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Did I forget anything important?&lt;/p&gt; " /> <meta name="keywords" content="next, path, output, content, previous, url, relative_path, id, collection, excerpt, draft, categories, layout, title, date, tags, place, description, keywords, image, jb_picture, slug, ext" /> <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1"/> <meta name="google-site-verification" content="JEj_gQr2CPe2QKGw8XdMz0R7VboQIUbX3FlM-lwTq-8" /> <meta name="author" content="Yegor Bugayenko"> <meta name="article:published_time" content="2018-08-29 00:00:00 +0000"> <meta name="og:site_name" content="Yegor Bugayenko"/> <meta name="og:type" content="article" /> <meta name="og:locale" content="en_US" /> <meta name="twitter:account_id" content="4503599630178231" /> <meta name="twitter:creator" content="@yegor256"/> <meta name="twitter:site" content="@yegor256"/> <meta name="twitter:title" property="og:title" content="Soft Skills Demystified"/> <meta name="twitter:description" property="og:description" content="&lt;p&gt;There are tech skills and there are soft skills.

Of course, smiling in the office and not cursing at a stupid boss—helps. But this is not what soft skills are about.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They are about our ability to &lt;em&gt;exchange&lt;/em&gt; deliverables. Tech skills produce deliverables, soft skills turn them into a final product, which is working software. Here is a short list, in no particular order:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drawing&lt;/strong&gt;. Talking works great when you’re discussing your next vacation with your partner. In a software team your ability to explain your thoughts with a diagram seriously increases your usefulness.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Writing&lt;/strong&gt;. Again, talking is great, when your chaotic team is being managed by an hysterical boss who just read a book about unconditional love. In a more disciplined environment your ability to put your thoughts in writing do make a difference for mutual success.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reporting&lt;/strong&gt;. A good programmer knows not only how to fix a bug but, more importantly, how to report it &lt;a href=&quot;/2018/04/24/right-way-to-report-bugs.html&quot;&gt;the right way&lt;/a&gt;, so that the project benefits. An ability to describe a technical problem in simple words is a crucial soft skill.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Volunteering&lt;/strong&gt;. Open source is an important part of any software project. You have to know how to work with an open source community, by giving them something back for the software they provide. Sometimes you will have to report problems to them, sometimes even submit pull requests, and maybe even create your own open source products. You will need a lot of non-tech skills to do that.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Charging&lt;/strong&gt;. Programmers make money by writing code. Very often projects fail because important people quit due to a money conflict. They don’t know how to resolve that, how to manage their financial objectives, how to ask for a raise, or how to change the paying schedule. I blame programmers for that. We, technical people, have to know how to manage our financial relationship with our projects.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Relaxing&lt;/strong&gt;. Many projects fail because its programmers burn out. This happens, very often, because they don’t know how to manage their time right: when to work and when to relax. Again, I blame programmers. We have to know how to manage our own peace of mind.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Asking&lt;/strong&gt;. Not your friends, but StackOverflow and other public sources. The software development world is getting global and the knowledge your project team possess is just a tiny fraction of what the world knows about the problem you are solving. You have to know how to ask the world. This is the soft skill you need to have to be a good developer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tweeting&lt;/strong&gt;. Here comes your ability to share your thoughts and achievements in social networks. If you stay mute and net-social-phobic, you are not really helping your project. This is the skill you won’t learn in a few days. I would suggest you take a look at my &lt;a href=&quot;/256-bloghacks.html&quot;&gt;256 Bloghacks&lt;/a&gt; book.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Testing&lt;/strong&gt;. Here I mean not only writing automated tests, which is a tech skill, but an ability to communicate with testers, to make sure their feedback improves the quality of the software under development. There is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378720613000967&quot;&gt;well known&lt;/a&gt; developer-tester conflict, which good programmers know how to deal with.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Still working in a single master branch? Still an amateur.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Branching&lt;/strong&gt;. Still working in a single &lt;code&gt;master&lt;/code&gt; branch? Still an amateur. You have to learn how to use multiple branches, how to resolve conflicts between them, and what is the difference between merge and rebase. This is a soft skill, since it doesn’t have anything to do with the quality of your code but it seriously affects your professionalism as a software developer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Failing&lt;/strong&gt;. Most projects fail, one way or another. Technical failures are not the primary source of our troubles. We fail due to management incompetence most frequently. Good programmers know how to deal with failures, by provoking (aka Fail Fast), predicting (aka Risk Management), and embracing them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Delivering&lt;/strong&gt;. Continuous integration, delivery pipeline, build automation, staging, green/blue deployments, etc.—if you think that all these things concern the DevOps department only, you are wrong. You have to understand how your lines of code reach your users. The bigger the product, the longer the pipeline, the more people it involves, and the more soft skills it requires to be smooth.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Intriguing&lt;/strong&gt;. Any project is a part of a bigger political game, one way or the other. If you isolate yourself from intrigue, claiming that your job is to write code—you are not a good programmer. A good programmer understands where the money is coming from, who the primary shareholders are, and which ass to kiss and when.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Did I forget anything important?&lt;/p&gt; "/> <meta

This is the skill you won’t learn in a few days. I would suggest you take a look at my <a href="/256-bloghacks.html">256 Bloghacks</a> book.</p><p><strong>Testing</strong>. Here I mean not only writing automated tests, which is a tech skill, but an ability to communicate with testers, to make sure their feedback improves the quality of the software under development. There is a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378720613000967">well known</a> developer-tester conflict, which good programmers know how to deal with.</p><aside class="quote">Still working in a single master branch? Still an amateur.</aside><p><strong>Branching</strong>. Still working in a single <code>master</code> branch? Still an amateur. You have to learn how to use multiple branches, how to resolve conflicts between them, and what is the difference between merge and rebase. This is a soft skill, since it doesn’t have anything to do with the quality of your code but it seriously affects your professionalism as a software developer.</p><p><strong>Failing</strong>. Most projects fail, one way or another. Technical failures are not the primary source of our troubles. We fail due to management incompetence most frequently. Good programmers know how to deal with failures, by provoking (aka Fail Fast), predicting (aka Risk Management), and embracing them.</p><p><strong>Delivering</strong>. Continuous integration, delivery pipeline, build automation, staging, green/blue deployments, etc.—if you think that all these things concern the DevOps department only, you are wrong. You have to understand how your lines of code reach your users. The bigger the product, the longer the pipeline, the more people it involves, and the more soft skills it requires to be smooth.</p><p><strong>Intriguing</strong>. Any project is a part of a bigger political game, one way or the other. If you isolate yourself from intrigue, claiming that your job is to write code—you are not a good programmer. A good programmer understands where the money is coming from, who the primary shareholders are, and which ass to kiss and when.</p><p>Did I forget anything important?</p></div></article></div><div class="wrapper"> <related-posts /></div><div class="disqus" role="complementary"><p class="disqus_hint"> Please, use <a href="https://help.disqus.com/commenting/what-html-tags-are-allowed-within-comments">syntax highlighting</a> in your comments, to make them more readable.</p><div id="disqus_thread" class="disqus-thread"> <a>&nbsp;</a></div><script> var disqus_config = function () { this.page.url = document.location.href.split('?')[0].split('#')[0].replace('https://', 'http://'); this.page.identifier = this.page.url; }; (function() { var d = document, s = d.createElement('script'); s.src = '//yegor256.disqus.com/embed.js'; s.setAttribute('data-timestamp', +new Date()); (d.head || d.body).appendChild(s); })(); </script> <noscript><div><p class="red"> JavaScript is disabled in your browser, that's why you can't see comments under this post.</p></div></noscript></div><div class="wrapper"> <footer class="footer"><p> &copy; <span itemscope="" itemprop="copyrightHolder" itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"> <span itemprop="name">Yegor Bugayenko</span> </span> 2014&ndash;<span itemprop="copyrightYear">2018</span></p></footer></div></section><div class="wrapper unprintable" style="text-align:center;margin-top:2em;"> <a href="http://www.sixnines.io/h/3ba1652f"> <img src="//www.sixnines.io/b/3ba1652f?style=flat" alt="sixnines availability badge"/> </a></div><script src="//code.jquery.com/jquery-1.9.0.min.js"></script> <script src="/js/all.js?c998b88f617"></script> <script>var disqus_shortname = 'yegor256';</script> <script id="dsq-count-scr" src="//yegor256.disqus.com/count.js" async="async"></script> <script> (function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){ (i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o), m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m) })(window,document,'script','//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga'); ga('create', 'UA-1963507-32', 'auto'); ga('send', 'pageview'); </script> <script> Cd=document;Cr="&"+Math.random();Cp="&s=1"; Cd.cookie="b=b";if(Cd.cookie)Cp+="&c=1"; Cp+="&t="+(new Date()).getTimezoneOffset(); if(self!=top)Cp+="&f=1"; </script> <script> if(navigator.javaEnabled())Cp+="&j=1"; </script> <script> if(typeof(screen)!='undefined')Cp+="&w="+screen.width+"&h="+ screen.height+"&d="+(screen.colorDepth?screen.colorDepth:screen.pixelDepth); </script> <script> Cd.write("<img src='//c.hit.ua/hit?i=95870&g=0&x=2"+Cp+Cr+ "&r="+escape(Cd.referrer)+"&u="+escape(window.location.href)+ "' border='0' wi"+"dth='1' he"+"ight='1'/>"); </script> <script type="application/ld+json"> { "@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Person", "name": "Yegor Bugayenko", "url": "https://www.yegor256.com", "sameAs": [ "https://www.facebook.com/yegor256", "https://instagram.com/yegor256", "https://www.linkedin.com/in/yegor256", "https://twitter.com/yegor256", "https://github.com/yegor256", "https://www.pinterest.com/yegor256/" ] } </script> </body> </html> <!DOCTYPE html> <html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/WebSite"> <head> <meta charset="utf-8"/> <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Here is how it goes, over and over again.

Well, you can blame everybody around you, but first of all you should blame the code base itself. How do you blame it? You report its low quality by creating new tickets, which may sound like this:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;“The class X is not sufficiently documented, I don’t understand how it works.”&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;“The method X is too complex, I don’t know what it does.”&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;“The algorithm X is messy, I can’t figure out what it does.”&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;“The library X is used here, but I don’t understand why you don’t use library Y.”&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;“The rules of class naming are not clear, document them please.”&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;“The principle of data organization is not obvious, document it.”&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, don’t make the mistake many programmers are making when we tell them that tickets are the only &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/10/07/stop-chatting-start-coding.html&quot;&gt;right way&lt;/a&gt; to solve problems. They start asking questions and seeking help in the tickets, just like this:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;“How can I unit test class X, please explain.”&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;“Please help me create class X.”&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;“Where should I put class X, in which package?”&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;“Which library should I use for doing X?”&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;The project is &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/02/16/it-is-not-a-school.html&quot;&gt;not a school&lt;/a&gt;, it’s not interested in making you smarter or more of an expert in its code. Nobody will explain anything to &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt;, because it’s a waste of money and time. What the project will do instead is fix its code base so that it becomes cleaner and more obvious for you &lt;em&gt;and everybody else&lt;/em&gt;. Thus, never ask for explanation or help, ask for documentation and source code fixes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;You can blame everybody around you, but first of all you should blame the code base itself.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;What do you do next? You sit and wait, until those tickets are resolved. Who will resolve them? You don’t care. That’s a problem for the project manager. Maybe he/she will even assign those tickets back to you and it will be your problem to resolve them. But if that happens, the scope of work will be different for you. You won’t need to fix the bug anymore, you will have to document some functionality or refactor some module.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You will have other problems in this new and smaller scope. You will create new tickets, blaming everybody around you, and they also may come back to you. And so on and so forth. Ultimately, the scope of a ticket will be as small as it’s possible to fix in 30 minutes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;See the algorithm? I’m sure you do, but it’s very difficult to apply it to real life and real software projects, for a few obvious psychological reasons:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You are ashamed&lt;/strong&gt;. You are trained to feel guilty when you are not smart enough. What can I say?

You want to complete the entire ticket, solve the entire problem, and understand the entire scope. What can I say? This won’t be solved while the project continues to pay you &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/07/21/hourly-pay-modern-slavery.html&quot;&gt;by the hour/month&lt;/a&gt;.

You just don’t care about the quality of code at all. You don’t want it to look clean, you can’t even tell what clean is or what messy is. You just want them to pay you by the end of the month. In this case you won’t even know what tickets to report. What can I say? I guess you have to try and find another job. Maybe a &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/01/05/how-to-punish-employees.html&quot;&gt;manager&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You are afraid&lt;/strong&gt;.

Not at all.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I truly believe that quality is not what programmers should care about. They must care only about speed—close tasks as soon as possible— which means &lt;a href=&quot;/2018/01/09/micro-budgeting.html&quot;&gt;make money&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Won’t this attitude ruin the project and turn the code base into a mess?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Yes, it will.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If the project doesn’t care about its quality either.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There must be a permanent conflict between a project and its programmers: 1) the project must be configured to reject anything that lowers the quality of its artifacts and 2) programmers must be interested in making changes to those artifacts. The project cares about the quality, the programmers care about fast delivery of modifications.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What do I mean by saying that a project rejects low quality? Here is a list of preventive measures it may take to make it impossible to jeopardize the quality:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/2014/07/24/rultor-automated-merging.html&quot;&gt;Automated&lt;/a&gt; pre-flight builds;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/2014/07/21/read-only-master-branch.html&quot;&gt;Read-only master branch&lt;/a&gt;;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;High test coverage bar;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/2018/01/16/educational-aspect-of-static-analysis.html&quot;&gt;Mandatory&lt;/a&gt; static analysis;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Multi-step code reviews.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;What do I mean by saying that programmers must be interested in making changes? They have to be &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/09/24/why-monetary-awards-dont-work.html&quot;&gt;motivated&lt;/a&gt; to close tasks. Not just to &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/10/06/how-to-be-good-office-slave.html&quot;&gt;be in the project&lt;/a&gt;, but to deliver. Here is what they can do in order to close tasks faster:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/2015/01/15/how-to-cut-corners.html&quot;&gt;Cut corners&lt;/a&gt;;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Make changes &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/02/09/serious-code-reviewer.html&quot;&gt;smaller&lt;/a&gt;;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/2015/02/16/it-is-not-a-school.html&quot;&gt;Don’t study&lt;/a&gt; the code, just modify it;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Don’t feel responsible for all code, just focus on the relevant units/classes;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Don’t be afraid to &lt;a href=&quot;/2017/03/24/tdd-that-works.html&quot;&gt;break things&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;If we put these two interests in conflict, we will get a high-quality product, which is growing very fast. The project will enforce quality, programmers will push the code forward, making changes fast and frequently.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, most projects have a very different philosophy. They delegate quality control to programmers, hoping that they “won’t do evil.” This leads to frustration, distress, constant fear of mistakes, long delays, blaming, and shaming. Both the project and its programmers lose.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;If we put these two interests in conflict, we will get a high-quality product, which is growing very fast.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;Programmers must not be responsible for the quality! They must not care what they may, or will, break. They must not care how good the code they write is. They must not “feel responsible” for the overall result. Instead, they must be focused on making money for their families by writing the largest amount of code and closing more tickets.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Not because they are ignorant and selfish, but because this is the right balance of responsibilities. This is how the project will get the most out of its developers—by freeing their minds of unnecessary and unproductive quality worries and letting them focus on what they do best—writing code.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Of course, not every project will be able to configure itself in the most effective way. Most projects don’t even know how to do it. In those projects, if you, as a developer, floor the speed pedal, you will most likely ruin their code base in a few days. That’s why the recommendations above are only applicable to those who really know what they are doing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zerocracy.com&quot;&gt;We&lt;/a&gt; know what we are doing in our projects. We don’t let any developers touch any parts of our code, unless the “quality wall” is high and strong enough. How high is that wall in your projects?

Usually, the former includes the latter, but not always. Coding produces lines of code, while software development creates products. Unfortunately, the majority of programmers joining &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zerocracy.com&quot;&gt;Zerocracy&lt;/a&gt; now are &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/10/26/hacker-vs-programmer-mentality.html&quot;&gt;coders&lt;/a&gt;. Even though they claim to be developers, in reality they are lacking the very important &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sociotechnical_system&quot;&gt;sociotechnical&lt;/a&gt; skills that differentiate product creators from lines-of-code writers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;!--more--&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;jb_picture&quot;&gt;&lt;img itemprop=&quot;image&quot; alt=&quot;Hard Men (1996) by J.K.

Amalou&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Let me show you the symptoms first.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Let’s call him Mario. He is a very skilled Java developer, as his &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/03/08/pimp-up-your-resume.html&quot;&gt;resume&lt;/a&gt; says. He’s been in the industry for ten years or so, done a few enterprise projects; he seems to be very seasoned. We give him access to the project and assign a few GitHub tickets.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Dude, I love you like a brother, but I don't have time to answer your questions.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;In a few hours I get a Facebook message a page long. It says that he is very glad to be on the project, but &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/02/16/it-is-not-a-school.html&quot;&gt;doesn’t understand&lt;/a&gt; a thing yet and needs help. Here is a list of questions he prepared and he’s ready for a phone call to get them answered.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I reply: “Dude, I love you like a brother, but I don’t have time to answer your questions. Not because I’m lazy or don’t appreciate your work… Actually, yes, exactly because of that. I am lazy and don’t want to answer any questions over Messenger. My answers will be totally wasted, if you, for example, quit the project tomorrow. Or if someone else joins us in a week and has exactly the same set of questions. Do I have to explain all over again? I’m too &lt;del&gt;old&lt;/del&gt; lazy for that.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He most probably thinks that I’m an &lt;a href=&quot;/testimonials.html&quot;&gt;arrogant prick&lt;/a&gt;, but what can he do? He reads &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/10/07/stop-chatting-start-coding.html&quot;&gt;my article&lt;/a&gt; on this very subject and says “OK, I got it.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In half an hour Mario submits a ticket to another (!) repository. The title is “The problem” and the description says “Help me understand the project.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What do I do, as an architect of the project? I close the ticket with a quick message: “Please, make your tickets more specific.” My response is just one step away from “Get lost,” but what else can I say? Mario doesn’t know &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/11/24/principles-of-bug-tracking.html&quot;&gt;how to use&lt;/a&gt; the ticketing system. He’s most probably been working all his life in a &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/10/06/how-to-be-good-office-slave.html&quot;&gt;cozy office&lt;/a&gt;, where everybody around was his friend. Not even using chat, just asking questions across the table. I’m asking him to do something he has never done before. Of course, he doesn’t know how. He feels ashamed, I suspect.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;The bottom line is that Mario is not a software developer, he's a coder.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;What happens next? He comes right back at me in Messenger, with the same set of questions. Actually, his reaction will depend on his personality. It may either be anger, confusion, or &lt;a href=&quot;/2018/01/09/micro-budgeting.html&quot;&gt;something else&lt;/a&gt;. But the bottom line is that Mario is not a software developer, he’s a coder. He doesn’t understand the dynamics of a modern software project, he doesn’t know how to use its &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/08/23/communication-maturity.html&quot;&gt;communication&lt;/a&gt; instruments, and he has no sociotechnical skills:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Searching for, and finding, information&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Submitting questions, collecting answers&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Adding knowledge to the repository&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Submitting code changes&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Arguing in writing, reviewing changes&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Closing tickets and preventing them from closing&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Maintaining discipline in repositories&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;The same happens to almost everybody who joins us, unfortunately.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A modern software project is much more a social activity than code writing.

Usually, the former includes the latter, but not always. Coding produces lines of code, while software development creates products. Unfortunately, the majority of programmers joining &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zerocracy.com&quot;&gt;Zerocracy&lt;/a&gt; now are &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/10/26/hacker-vs-programmer-mentality.html&quot;&gt;coders&lt;/a&gt;. Even though they claim to be developers, in reality they are lacking the very important &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sociotechnical_system&quot;&gt;sociotechnical&lt;/a&gt; skills that differentiate product creators from lines-of-code writers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;!--more--&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;jb_picture&quot;&gt;&lt;img itemprop=&quot;image&quot; alt=&quot;Hard Men (1996) by J.K.

Amalou&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Let me show you the symptoms first.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Let’s call him Mario. He is a very skilled Java developer, as his &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/03/08/pimp-up-your-resume.html&quot;&gt;resume&lt;/a&gt; says. He’s been in the industry for ten years or so, done a few enterprise projects; he seems to be very seasoned. We give him access to the project and assign a few GitHub tickets.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Dude, I love you like a brother, but I don't have time to answer your questions.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;In a few hours I get a Facebook message a page long. It says that he is very glad to be on the project, but &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/02/16/it-is-not-a-school.html&quot;&gt;doesn’t understand&lt;/a&gt; a thing yet and needs help. Here is a list of questions he prepared and he’s ready for a phone call to get them answered.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I reply: “Dude, I love you like a brother, but I don’t have time to answer your questions. Not because I’m lazy or don’t appreciate your work… Actually, yes, exactly because of that. I am lazy and don’t want to answer any questions over Messenger. My answers will be totally wasted, if you, for example, quit the project tomorrow. Or if someone else joins us in a week and has exactly the same set of questions. Do I have to explain all over again? I’m too &lt;del&gt;old&lt;/del&gt; lazy for that.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He most probably thinks that I’m an &lt;a href=&quot;/testimonials.html&quot;&gt;arrogant prick&lt;/a&gt;, but what can he do? He reads &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/10/07/stop-chatting-start-coding.html&quot;&gt;my article&lt;/a&gt; on this very subject and says “OK, I got it.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In half an hour Mario submits a ticket to another (!) repository. The title is “The problem” and the description says “Help me understand the project.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What do I do, as an architect of the project? I close the ticket with a quick message: “Please, make your tickets more specific.” My response is just one step away from “Get lost,” but what else can I say? Mario doesn’t know &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/11/24/principles-of-bug-tracking.html&quot;&gt;how to use&lt;/a&gt; the ticketing system. He’s most probably been working all his life in a &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/10/06/how-to-be-good-office-slave.html&quot;&gt;cozy office&lt;/a&gt;, where everybody around was his friend. Not even using chat, just asking questions across the table. I’m asking him to do something he has never done before. Of course, he doesn’t know how. He feels ashamed, I suspect.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;The bottom line is that Mario is not a software developer, he's a coder.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;What happens next? He comes right back at me in Messenger, with the same set of questions. Actually, his reaction will depend on his personality. It may either be anger, confusion, or &lt;a href=&quot;/2018/01/09/micro-budgeting.html&quot;&gt;something else&lt;/a&gt;. But the bottom line is that Mario is not a software developer, he’s a coder. He doesn’t understand the dynamics of a modern software project, he doesn’t know how to use its &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/08/23/communication-maturity.html&quot;&gt;communication&lt;/a&gt; instruments, and he has no sociotechnical skills:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Searching for, and finding, information&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Submitting questions, collecting answers&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Adding knowledge to the repository&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Submitting code changes&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Arguing in writing, reviewing changes&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Closing tickets and preventing them from closing&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Maintaining discipline in repositories&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;The same happens to almost everybody who joins us, unfortunately.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A modern software project is much more a social activity than code writing.

Usually, the former includes the latter, but not always. Coding produces lines of code, while software development creates products. Unfortunately, the majority of programmers joining <a href="https://www.zerocracy.com">Zerocracy</a> now are <a href="/2014/10/26/hacker-vs-programmer-mentality.html">coders</a>. Even though they claim to be developers, in reality they are lacking the very important <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sociotechnical_system">sociotechnical</a> skills that differentiate product creators from lines-of-code writers.</p><figure class="jb_picture"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hard Men (1996) by J.K.

He is a very skilled Java developer, as his <a href="/2016/03/08/pimp-up-your-resume.html">resume</a> says. He’s been in the industry for ten years or so, done a few enterprise projects; he seems to be very seasoned. We give him access to the project and assign a few GitHub tickets.</p><aside class="quote">Dude, I love you like a brother, but I don't have time to answer your questions.</aside><p>In a few hours I get a Facebook message a page long. It says that he is very glad to be on the project, but <a href="/2015/02/16/it-is-not-a-school.html">doesn’t understand</a> a thing yet and needs help. Here is a list of questions he prepared and he’s ready for a phone call to get them answered.</p><p>I reply: “Dude, I love you like a brother, but I don’t have time to answer your questions. Not because I’m lazy or don’t appreciate your work… Actually, yes, exactly because of that. I am lazy and don’t want to answer any questions over Messenger. My answers will be totally wasted, if you, for example, quit the project tomorrow. Or if someone else joins us in a week and has exactly the same set of questions. Do I have to explain all over again? I’m too <del>old</del> lazy for that.”</p><p>He most probably thinks that I’m an <a href="/testimonials.html">arrogant prick</a>, but what can he do? He reads <a href="/2014/10/07/stop-chatting-start-coding.html">my article</a> on this very subject and says “OK, I got it.”</p><p>In half an hour Mario submits a ticket to another (!) repository. The title is “The problem” and the description says “Help me understand the project.”</p><p>What do I do, as an architect of the project? I close the ticket with a quick message: “Please, make your tickets more specific.” My response is just one step away from “Get lost,” but what else can I say? Mario doesn’t know <a href="/2014/11/24/principles-of-bug-tracking.html">how to use</a> the ticketing system. He’s most probably been working all his life in a <a href="/2015/10/06/how-to-be-good-office-slave.html">cozy office</a>, where everybody around was his friend. Not even using chat, just asking questions across the table. I’m asking him to do something he has never done before. Of course, he doesn’t know how. He feels ashamed, I suspect.</p><aside class="quote">The bottom line is that Mario is not a software developer, he's a coder.</aside><p>What happens next? He comes right back at me in Messenger, with the same set of questions. Actually, his reaction will depend on his personality. It may either be anger, confusion, or <a href="/2018/01/09/micro-budgeting.html">something else</a>. But the bottom line is that Mario is not a software developer, he’s a coder. He doesn’t understand the dynamics of a modern software project, he doesn’t know how to use its <a href="/2016/08/23/communication-maturity.html">communication</a> instruments, and he has no sociotechnical skills:</p><ul> <li>Searching for, and finding, information</li> <li>Submitting questions, collecting answers</li> <li>Adding knowledge to the repository</li> <li>Submitting code changes</li> <li>Arguing in writing, reviewing changes</li> <li>Closing tickets and preventing them from closing</li> <li>Maintaining discipline in repositories</li></ul><p>The same happens to almost everybody who joins us, unfortunately.</p><p>A modern software project is much more a social activity than code writing.

Keeping us busy is the key objective of these creatures and this is what makes them so annoying. To the contrary, &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/05/24/who-is-project-manager.html&quot;&gt;effective managers&lt;/a&gt; make sure we are &lt;em&gt;productive&lt;/em&gt;, meaning that our results satisfy their expectations. They are not interested in knowing what we are doing to deliver them—they manage the project, instead of managing us. And the first step to making the project manageable is to decompose its scope into smaller pieces.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;!--more--&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;jb_picture&quot;&gt;&lt;img itemprop=&quot;image&quot; alt=&quot;Carlito&amp;#39;s Way (1993) by Brian De Palma&quot; src=&quot;/images/2017/11/carlitos-way.jpg&quot; longdesc=&quot;#fa318a0d&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption id=&quot;fa318a0d&quot;&gt;Carlito&amp;#39;s Way (1993) by Brian De Palma&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Imagine you want to re-design your apartment, having a few thousand dollars for this job. You hire a group of people and give them all your money up front. They ask you to come back in two months, when everything will be ready. You say “OK” and wait for two months. I’m sure you already know what I’m getting at—this project most probably will be a failure, to some extent. In the worst case you won’t see these guys ever, they will just steal your money. In the best case, they will do something that will look “nice,” but not as nice as you expected.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;why-do-we-micromanage&quot;&gt;Why do we micromanage?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;What do you do in order to increase your chances of getting the best case scenario? That’s right, you micromanage them: you visit them every day, you ask them the famous “What are you doing now?” question, you push them when they are getting lazy, you control, you dominate, you annoy, you “stay on top,” you play the guilt card when they miss or forget, you &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/01/05/how-to-punish-employees.html&quot;&gt;punish&lt;/a&gt; them every way you can.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;The more aggressive you are, the higher the chances you win.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;You don’t do that because you’re evil. You just know that otherwise they will trash your apartment, will forget things, will miss something, will make mistakes, will spend more time and money than they are supposed to, will choose wrong fabrics, will purchase the furniture you don’t like, and will do many other things you’re well aware of if you’ve ever dealt with interior designers and house builders.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The more aggressive you are, the higher the chances you win.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And it’s not because you are evil. You’re not evil, you’re stupid (not you personally, my dear and respected reader, but you get the point).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;youtube&quot;&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhDmHkMAYnM&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;box&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uhDmHkMAYnM/mqdefault.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;YouTube video #uhDmHkMAYnM&quot; /&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;play&quot;&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;icon icon-play&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;div&gt;Micro-management vs. micro-tasking (webinar #25); 7 June 2017.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;The problem is that the project is not manageable. That’s why you have to resort to the last possible measure—micromanagement. Why is the project not manageable? Because its scope is not broken down into pieces. It contains a large single job called “Redesign The Apartment.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One of the key success factors for manageability is the famous 0/100 rule, which requires any task to be either “in progress” or “complete.” There can be nothing in the middle. When such a rule is in place, the task can be delegated to its performer and they can become responsible for its completion, they can be trusted.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We can’t “trust” our single large task to the performer, simply because it’s too big to be trusted. If they fail, the cost of failure will be too high. We have to take a &lt;em&gt;micro&lt;/em&gt;-scope and get into the task to manage it from the inside, annoying its performers, whom we are supposed to trust. The micromanagement we do is &lt;em&gt;inevitable&lt;/em&gt;, because the scope is not broken down.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scope decomposition was invented mostly in order to solve this very problem: to make the project more manageable. We need small tasks in the scope in order to be able to delegate them and never go inside in order to check what’s going on there, who is doing what, why, and where.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The smaller the tasks we can break the scope into, the better.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;how-small-can-tasks-be&quot;&gt;How small can tasks be?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;In our projects we break project scope into tasks of 30 minutes each. This may sound too extreme for you, but it works for us. We call them micro-tasks. We started to practice micro-tasking about seven years ago. We experimented with different task sizes, from 10 hours to 15 minutes, but eventually came down to 30 minutes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When tasks are bigger, we lose the manageability and simply get back to macro-tasking. When tasks are smaller, the context switching overhead becomes too annoying.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In our experience, a senior programmer, if fully dedicated to a project, completes 6-10 tasks a day. This means that they spend 3-5 hours working, while the rest of the time is spent on doing something else. This is a much more effective use of work time than we can achieve with traditional macro-tasking management, where programmers barely work for two hours a day, spending the rest of their time on something else (my personal observation).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;what-obstacles-did-we-have&quot;&gt;What obstacles did we have?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you decide to go for micro-tasking, you will most likely have the same or similar obstacles that we’ve had. Here is a short list of them and my advice, which may help if one day you decide to break a “Develop a Mobile App” task into, say, 2,500+ micro tasks:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vagueness&lt;/strong&gt;. Definition of done, exit criteria, requirements, expectations—there are many names, which are all about our inability to define what exactly we expect programmers to do. Software development by definition includes a lot of unknowns, creativity, experiments, and risks. Programmers will tell you that they can’t guarantee anything in most cases, and can’t really give any valid promises. We solve that by &lt;a href=&quot;/2010/03/04/pdd.html&quot;&gt;PDD&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Distraction&lt;/strong&gt;. Programmers are used to doing many different things at the same time: they write code, help others, watch YouTube, scroll Facebook, swear at Reddit, and read my blog. Initially most of them won’t like the idea of having explicit tasks in front of them, simply because they put a structure on their work time, making it much more visible to the management. They will tell you that they have many other things to do aside from your bloody tasks. We solve that by &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/04/17/how-xdsd-is-different.html&quot;&gt;paying by result&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/10/07/stop-chatting-start-coding.html&quot;&gt;prohibition of chitchats&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;They are simply spoiled by the traditional macro-tasking where they are paid by the month and nobody really controls their results.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Laziness&lt;/strong&gt;. Just like that apartment designers, programmers also love to get paid and do nothing. Who doesn’t, right? They will tell you that their work is more complicated than you think, that they need much more time, that they need to investigate the problem first, that reading documentation also takes a lot of time, etc. They are simply spoiled by the &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/10/06/how-to-be-good-office-slave.html&quot;&gt;traditional macro-tasking&lt;/a&gt; where they are paid by the month and nobody really controls their results. They are used to being &lt;del&gt;office slaves&lt;/del&gt; lazy. We solve that by &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/04/17/how-xdsd-is-different.html&quot;&gt;paying by result&lt;/a&gt; and the lazy ones simply quit.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Responsibility&lt;/strong&gt;. Micro-tasking will make individual results visible. When tasks are large people tend to work with them in groups and it’s unclear exactly who is responsible for failures and successes. Smaller tasks emphasize mistakes and make people “pay” for them. Not necessarily with cash, but definitely some way or other. Most programmers will find this concept very new and disturbing—they’ve almost never paid for their own mistakes before and never had their own tasks. The responsibility was always spread across the group. We solve that by &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/09/24/why-monetary-awards-dont-work.html&quot;&gt;monetary rewards and punishments&lt;/a&gt;, which make them very motivated and failure-ready.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Resentment&lt;/strong&gt;. This is one of the most popular and the most annoying of problems: they will tell you that they are “not monkeys.” They will actually combine all problems listed above and say that the right way to solve them is to give programmers freedom and let them do their job, since they are smart enough and don’t need any management from the top. And they will mostly be saying it quite honestly, with no intent to manipulate. The thing is that they are used to macro-tasking and believe that this is the only and the right way. I’m trying to solve this by writing this very blog post.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;There could be something else, but this is a more or less an exhaustive list of the problems we were faced with.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;where-micro-tasking-didnt-work&quot;&gt;Where micro-tasking didn’t work&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Obviously, any approach has its pros and cons. Micro-tasking seems to be the most effective management paradigm for us. However, it’s not applicable everywhere, according to our experience. There are territories where we failed to apply it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prototyping&lt;/strong&gt;. Every project or a new big feature starts with a prototype, which requires one or two people sitting next to each other, thinking, and experimenting. We tried to break this piece of work into smaller parts, but failed. It &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/10/06/software-project-lifecycle.html&quot;&gt;seems&lt;/a&gt; that this process has to be done as a single solid work package.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UI/UX&lt;/strong&gt;. We were mostly working with server-side Java/Ruby/C++ projects for the last few years and didn’t have many opportunities to apply micro-tasking to the UI/UX jobs. However, whatever we did try never really worked: graphic designers weren’t able to decompose their tasks into smaller parts.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Customers&lt;/strong&gt;. We &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/04/26/incremental-requirements-with-requs.html&quot;&gt;tried&lt;/a&gt; to decompose the task of eliciting requirements from our clients and failed a few times. Maybe our clients were stupid (I doubt that), maybe requirements were too complex, or maybe our system analysts were not professional enough. The bottom line is that we realized that such a task must be done as a solid piece of work, without any decomposition.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fire-fighting&lt;/strong&gt;. When the speed of delivery is the most important concern, micro-tasking doesn’t work for us. The overhead for dispatching and specifying tasks was taking too much time. When something is really urgent, we have to do the traditional macro-tasking and just “make it work.” Then we get back to micro-tasking.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Everything else, including programming, unit testing, manual testing, performance/load testing, integration testing, deployment, code review, documentation, and even training, can and must be managed via micro tasks.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;what-benefits-do-we-get&quot;&gt;What benefits do we get?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The most important benefit of micro-tasking is that the project becomes more manageable, as was mentioned above. Here is a more detailed break down:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Money works&lt;/strong&gt;. When tasks are very small, we can use &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/09/24/why-monetary-awards-dont-work.html&quot;&gt;good old dollar bills&lt;/a&gt; to motivate programmers. We can throw away literally &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/03/02/team-morale-myths-and-reality.html&quot;&gt;all other&lt;/a&gt; instruments.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We pay less&lt;/strong&gt;. We seriously lower our expenses, even though hourly rates of our programmers are &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/10/29/how-much-do-you-cost.html&quot;&gt;higher&lt;/a&gt; than many other projects can afford. I did a more or less &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/04/11/cost-of-loc.html&quot;&gt;detailed analysis&lt;/a&gt; a few years ago, which demonstrated that our projects were 30 (!) times more cost efficient than traditional ones.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Motivation is high&lt;/strong&gt;. Despite a very common stereotype that small and isolated tasks demotivate their performers, we see quite the opposite reaction: programmers are excited when it finally becomes possible to work within well-defined and explicit boundaries, independently, and in isolation. Not all of them, &lt;a href=&quot;/2018/01/09/micro-budgeting.html&quot;&gt;though&lt;/a&gt;. My personal observation is: only 25% of them can understand and enjoy micro-tasking. Others are either not professional enough or spoiled by &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/10/06/how-to-be-good-office-slave.html&quot;&gt;office slavery&lt;/a&gt;, where it’s possible to do almost nothing and stay very respected and well rewarded.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Turnover is not painful&lt;/strong&gt;. To make micro-tasking possible the management has to learn how to specify them: explicitly, unambiguously, and fast. When such a high level of transparency, formality, and agility (at the same time) is achieved, the project becomes less dependent on &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/12/29/turnover-is-good-for-maintainability.html&quot;&gt;experts&lt;/a&gt;. We lose the fear of losing people, because almost everything we need to know about the project is inside our task tracking system and project documentation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Easier to parallel&lt;/strong&gt;. Smaller tasks are easier to delegate to a larger amount of programmers. In some projects we sometimes have over 40 programmers at the same time, while the amount of tasks is relatively small (up to 200).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Metrics work&lt;/strong&gt;. When one programmer closes 40-50 tasks per week and another one closes 5-10, it does mean something, keeping in mind that all tasks are almost equal in size. We use this metric (and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.0crat.com/gang&quot;&gt;a few others&lt;/a&gt;) to make organizational and discipline decisions. In a macro-tasking environment almost no HR metrics really work.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quality is enforceable&lt;/strong&gt;. Large amounts of small tasks implies that we constantly and frequently close them. Each closure is an important point for quality control. That’s exactly where we have the ability to say “No” and reject the deliverables that violate our quality standards. With big tasks this “No” is much more painful for programmers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Risks are acceptable&lt;/strong&gt;. It’s impossible to accept the risk of the entire apartment redesign failure, since its cost is too high—a few thousand dollars. However, it is absolutely affordable to accept a risk of a kitchen lamp installation. Even if it falls and breaks, we will spend a few dollars and buy a new one. We don’t need to control the “lamp person”—we have a luxury to delegate and trust.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;The benefits programmers get overlap with our benefits. If they are professional and motivated enough they find it effective and productive to work with micro tasks, which are always well defined and properly paid.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;are-we-monkeys-or-not&quot;&gt;Are we monkeys or not?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now the most typical complaint we hear about micro-tasking is: “It is for junior programmers who are OK with being code monkeys.” To be honest, I also thought so a few years ago, when we started to experiment with &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/04/17/how-xdsd-is-different.html&quot;&gt;XDSD&lt;/a&gt;. What I quickly found out is that the most professional and self-motivated developers were enjoying micro-tasking, while their less mature and less skilled colleagues were finding it difficult to keep up.&lt;/p&gt; " /> <meta name="keywords" content="next, path, output, content, previous, url, relative_path, id, collection, excerpt, draft, categories, layout, title, date, place, tags, description, keywords, image, jb_picture, buffer, slug, ext" /> <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1"/> <meta name="google-site-verification" content="JEj_gQr2CPe2QKGw8XdMz0R7VboQIUbX3FlM-lwTq-8" /> <meta name="author" content="Yegor Bugayenko"> <meta name="article:published_time" content="2017-11-28 00:00:00 +0000"> <meta name="og:site_name" content="Yegor Bugayenko"/> <meta name="og:type" content="article" /> <meta name="og:locale" content="en_US" /> <meta name="twitter:account_id" content="4503599630178231" /> <meta name="twitter:creator" content="@yegor256"/> <meta name="twitter:site" content="@yegor256"/> <meta name="twitter:title" property="og:title" content="How Micro Is Your Tasking?"/> <meta name="twitter:description" property="og:description" content="&lt;p&gt;“What are you doing now?”—when you hear this question from your boss, be aware: you’re dealing with a &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/09/22/micromanagement.html&quot;&gt;micromanager&lt;/a&gt;. Keeping us busy is the key objective of these creatures and this is what makes them so annoying. To the contrary, &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/05/24/who-is-project-manager.html&quot;&gt;effective managers&lt;/a&gt; make sure we are &lt;em&gt;productive&lt;/em&gt;, meaning that our results satisfy their expectations. They are not interested in knowing what we are doing to deliver them—they manage the project, instead of managing us. And the first step to making the project manageable is to decompose its scope into smaller pieces.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;!--more--&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;jb_picture&quot;&gt;&lt;img itemprop=&quot;image&quot; alt=&quot;Carlito&amp;#39;s Way (1993) by Brian De Palma&quot; src=&quot;/images/2017/11/carlitos-way.jpg&quot; longdesc=&quot;#fa318a0d&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption id=&quot;fa318a0d&quot;&gt;Carlito&amp;#39;s Way (1993) by Brian De Palma&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Imagine you want to re-design your apartment, having a few thousand dollars for this job. You hire a group of people and give them all your money up front. They ask you to come back in two months, when everything will be ready. You say “OK” and wait for two months. I’m sure you already know what I’m getting at—this project most probably will be a failure, to some extent. In the worst case you won’t see these guys ever, they will just steal your money. In the best case, they will do something that will look “nice,” but not as nice as you expected.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;why-do-we-micromanage&quot;&gt;Why do we micromanage?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;What do you do in order to increase your chances of getting the best case scenario? That’s right, you micromanage them: you visit them every day, you ask them the famous “What are you doing now?” question, you push them when they are getting lazy, you control, you dominate, you annoy, you “stay on top,” you play the guilt card when they miss or forget, you &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/01/05/how-to-punish-employees.html&quot;&gt;punish&lt;/a&gt; them every way you can.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;The more aggressive you are, the higher the chances you win.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;You don’t do that because you’re evil. You just know that otherwise they will trash your apartment, will forget things, will miss something, will make mistakes, will spend more time and money than they are supposed to, will choose wrong fabrics, will purchase the furniture you don’t like, and will do many other things you’re well aware of if you’ve ever dealt with interior designers and house builders.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The more aggressive you are, the higher the chances you win.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And it’s not because you are evil. You’re not evil, you’re stupid (not you personally, my dear and respected reader, but you get the point).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;youtube&quot;&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhDmHkMAYnM&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;box&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uhDmHkMAYnM/mqdefault.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;YouTube video #uhDmHkMAYnM&quot; /&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;play&quot;&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;icon icon-play&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;div&gt;Micro-management vs. micro-tasking (webinar #25); 7 June 2017.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;The problem is that the project is not manageable. That’s why you have to resort to the last possible measure—micromanagement. Why is the project not manageable? Because its scope is not broken down into pieces. It contains a large single job called “Redesign The Apartment.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One of the key success factors for manageability is the famous 0/100 rule, which requires any task to be either “in progress” or “complete.” There can be nothing in the middle. When such a rule is in place, the task can be delegated to its performer and they can become responsible for its completion, they can be trusted.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We can’t “trust” our single large task to the performer, simply because it’s too big to be trusted. If they fail, the cost of failure will be too high. We have to take a &lt;em&gt;micro&lt;/em&gt;-scope and get into the task to manage it from the inside, annoying its performers, whom we are supposed to trust. The micromanagement we do is &lt;em&gt;inevitable&lt;/em&gt;, because the scope is not broken down.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scope decomposition was invented mostly in order to solve this very problem: to make the project more manageable. We need small tasks in the scope in order to be able to delegate them and never go inside in order to check what’s going on there, who is doing what, why, and where.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The smaller the tasks we can break the scope into, the better.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;how-small-can-tasks-be&quot;&gt;How small can tasks be?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;In our projects we break project scope into tasks of 30 minutes each. This may sound too extreme for you, but it works for us. We call them micro-tasks. We started to practice micro-tasking about seven years ago. We experimented with different task sizes, from 10 hours to 15 minutes, but eventually came down to 30 minutes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When tasks are bigger, we lose the manageability and simply get back to macro-tasking.

I did a more or less &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/04/11/cost-of-loc.html&quot;&gt;detailed analysis&lt;/a&gt; a few years ago, which demonstrated that our projects were 30 (!) times more cost efficient than traditional ones.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Motivation is high&lt;/strong&gt;. Despite a very common stereotype that small and isolated tasks demotivate their performers, we see quite the opposite reaction: programmers are excited when it finally becomes possible to work within well-defined and explicit boundaries, independently, and in isolation. Not all of them, &lt;a href=&quot;/2018/01/09/micro-budgeting.html&quot;&gt;though&lt;/a&gt;. My personal observation is: only 25% of them can understand and enjoy micro-tasking. Others are either not professional enough or spoiled by &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/10/06/how-to-be-good-office-slave.html&quot;&gt;office slavery&lt;/a&gt;, where it’s possible to do almost nothing and stay very respected and well rewarded.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Turnover is not painful&lt;/strong&gt;. To make micro-tasking possible the management has to learn how to specify them: explicitly, unambiguously, and fast. When such a high level of transparency, formality, and agility (at the same time) is achieved, the project becomes less dependent on &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/12/29/turnover-is-good-for-maintainability.html&quot;&gt;experts&lt;/a&gt;. We lose the fear of losing people, because almost everything we need to know about the project is inside our task tracking system and project documentation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Easier to parallel&lt;/strong&gt;. Smaller tasks are easier to delegate to a larger amount of programmers. In some projects we sometimes have over 40 programmers at the same time, while the amount of tasks is relatively small (up to 200).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Metrics work&lt;/strong&gt;. When one programmer closes 40-50 tasks per week and another one closes 5-10, it does mean something, keeping in mind that all tasks are almost equal in size. We use this metric (and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.0crat.com/gang&quot;&gt;a few others&lt;/a&gt;) to make organizational and discipline decisions. In a macro-tasking environment almost no HR metrics really work.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quality is enforceable&lt;/strong&gt;. Large amounts of small tasks implies that we constantly and frequently close them. Each closure is an important point for quality control. That’s exactly where we have the ability to say “No” and reject the deliverables that violate our quality standards. With big tasks this “No” is much more painful for programmers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Risks are acceptable&lt;/strong&gt;. It’s impossible to accept the risk of the entire apartment redesign failure, since its cost is too high—a few thousand dollars. However, it is absolutely affordable to accept a risk of a kitchen lamp installation. Even if it falls and breaks, we will spend a few dollars and buy a new one. We don’t need to control the “lamp person”—we have a luxury to delegate and trust.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;The benefits programmers get overlap with our benefits. If they are professional and motivated enough they find it effective and productive to work with micro tasks, which are always well defined and properly paid.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;are-we-monkeys-or-not&quot;&gt;Are we monkeys or not?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now the most typical complaint we hear about micro-tasking is: “It is for junior programmers who are OK with being code monkeys.” To be honest, I also thought so a few years ago, when we started to experiment with &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/04/17/how-xdsd-is-different.html&quot;&gt;XDSD&lt;/a&gt;. What I quickly found out is that the most professional and self-motivated developers were enjoying micro-tasking, while their less mature and less skilled colleagues were finding it difficult to keep up.&lt;/p&gt; "/> <meta name="twitter:url" property="og:url" content="https://www.yegor256.com/2017/11/28/microtasking.html"/> <meta name="telegram:channel" content="AAAAAEJFMRzsRTRxM3ec6A"/> <link

question from your boss, be aware: you’re dealing with a <a href="/2015/09/22/micromanagement.html">micromanager</a>. Keeping us busy is the key objective of these creatures and this is what makes them so annoying. To the contrary, <a href="/2016/05/24/who-is-project-manager.html">effective managers</a> make sure we are <em>productive</em>, meaning that our results satisfy their expectations. They are not interested in knowing what we are doing to deliver them—they manage the project, instead of managing us. And the first step to making the project manageable is to decompose its scope into smaller pieces.</p><figure class="jb_picture"><img itemprop="image" alt="Carlito&#39;s Way (1993) by Brian De Palma" src="/images/2017/11/carlitos-way.jpg" longdesc="#fa318a0d" /><figcaption id="fa318a0d">Carlito&#39;s Way (1993) by Brian De Palma</figcaption></figure><p>Imagine you want to re-design your apartment, having a few thousand dollars for this job. You hire a group of people and give them all your money up front. They ask you to come back in two months, when everything will be ready. You say “OK” and wait for two months. I’m sure you already know what I’m getting at—this project most probably will be a failure, to some extent. In the worst case you won’t see these guys ever, they will just steal your money. In the best case, they will do something that will look “nice,” but not as nice as you expected.</p><h2 id="why-do-we-micromanage">Why do we micromanage?</h2><p>What do you do in order to increase your chances of getting the best case scenario? That’s right, you micromanage them: you visit them every day, you ask them the famous “What are you doing now?” question, you push them when they are getting lazy, you control, you dominate, you annoy, you “stay on top,” you play the guilt card when they miss or forget, you <a href="/2016/01/05/how-to-punish-employees.html">punish</a> them every way you can.</p><aside class="quote">The more aggressive you are, the higher the chances you win.</aside><p>You don’t do that because you’re evil.

That’s why you have to resort to the last possible measure—micromanagement. Why is the project not manageable? Because its scope is not broken down into pieces. It contains a large single job called “Redesign The Apartment.”</p><p>One of the key success factors for manageability is the famous 0/100 rule, which requires any task to be either “in progress” or “complete.” There can be nothing in the middle. When such a rule is in place, the task can be delegated to its performer and they can become responsible for its completion, they can be trusted.</p><p>We can’t “trust” our single large task to the performer, simply because it’s too big to be trusted. If they fail, the cost of failure will be too high. We have to take a <em>micro</em>-scope and get into the task to manage it from the inside, annoying its performers, whom we are supposed to trust. The micromanagement we do is <em>inevitable</em>, because the scope is not broken down.</p><p>Scope decomposition was invented mostly in order to solve this very problem: to make the project more manageable. We need small tasks in the scope in order to be able to delegate them and never go inside in order to check what’s going on there, who is doing what, why, and where.</p><p>The smaller the tasks we can break the scope into, the better.</p><h2 id="how-small-can-tasks-be">How small can tasks be?</h2><p>In our projects we break project scope into tasks of 30 minutes each. This may sound too extreme for you, but it works for us. We call them micro-tasks. We started to practice micro-tasking about seven years ago. We experimented with different task sizes, from 10 hours to 15 minutes, but eventually came down to 30 minutes.</p><p>When tasks are bigger, we lose the manageability and simply get back to macro-tasking. When tasks are smaller, the context switching overhead becomes too annoying.</p><p>In our experience, a senior programmer, if fully dedicated to a project, completes 6-10 tasks a day. This means that they spend 3-5 hours working, while the rest of the time is spent on doing something else. This is a much more effective use of work time than we can achieve with traditional macro-tasking management, where programmers barely work for two hours a day, spending the rest of their time on something else (my personal observation).</p><h2 id="what-obstacles-did-we-have">What obstacles did we have?</h2><p>If you decide to go for micro-tasking, you will most likely have the same or similar obstacles that we’ve had. Here is a short list of them and my advice, which may help if one day you decide to break a “Develop a Mobile App” task into, say, 2,500+ micro tasks:</p><ul> <li><p><strong>Vagueness</strong>. Definition of done, exit criteria, requirements, expectations—there are many names, which are all about our inability to define what exactly we expect programmers to do. Software development by definition includes a lot of unknowns, creativity, experiments, and risks. Programmers will tell you that they can’t guarantee anything in most cases, and can’t really give any valid promises. We solve that by <a href="/2010/03/04/pdd.html">PDD</a>.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Distraction</strong>. Programmers are used to doing many different things at the same time: they write code, help others, watch YouTube, scroll Facebook, swear at Reddit, and read my blog. Initially most of them won’t like the idea of having explicit tasks in front of them, simply because they put a structure on their work time, making it much more visible to the management. They will tell you that they have many other things to do aside from your bloody tasks. We solve that by <a href="/2014/04/17/how-xdsd-is-different.html">paying by result</a> and <a href="/2014/10/07/stop-chatting-start-coding.html">prohibition of chitchats</a>.</p></li></ul><aside class="quote">They are simply spoiled by the traditional macro-tasking where they are paid by the month and nobody really controls their results.</aside><ul> <li><p><strong>Laziness</strong>. Just like that apartment designers, programmers also love to get paid and do nothing. Who doesn’t, right? They will tell you that their work is more complicated than you think, that they need much more time, that they need to investigate the problem first, that reading documentation also takes a lot of time, etc. They are simply spoiled by the <a href="/2015/10/06/how-to-be-good-office-slave.html">traditional macro-tasking</a> where they are paid by the month and nobody really controls their results. They are used to being <del>office slaves</del> lazy. We solve that by <a href="/2014/04/17/how-xdsd-is-different.html">paying by result</a> and the lazy ones simply quit.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Responsibility</strong>. Micro-tasking will make individual results visible. When tasks are large people tend to work with them in groups and it’s unclear exactly who is responsible for failures and successes. Smaller tasks emphasize mistakes and make people “pay” for them. Not necessarily with cash, but definitely some way or other. Most programmers will find this concept very new and disturbing—they’ve almost never paid for their own mistakes before and never had their own tasks. The responsibility was always spread across the group. We solve that by <a href="/2014/09/24/why-monetary-awards-dont-work.html">monetary rewards and punishments</a>, which make them very motivated and failure-ready.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Resentment</strong>. This is one of the most popular and the most annoying of problems: they will tell you that they are “not monkeys.” They will actually combine all problems listed above and say that the right way to solve them is to give programmers freedom and let them do their job, since they are smart enough and don’t need any management from the top. And they will mostly be saying it quite honestly, with no intent to manipulate. The thing is that they are used to macro-tasking and believe that this is the only and the right way. I’m trying to solve this by writing this very blog post.</p></li></ul><p>There could be something else, but this is a more or less an exhaustive list of the problems we were faced with.</p><h2 id="where-micro-tasking-didnt-work">Where micro-tasking didn’t work</h2><p>Obviously, any approach has its pros and cons. Micro-tasking seems to be the most effective management paradigm for us. However, it’s not applicable everywhere, according to our experience. There are territories where we failed to apply it.</p><ul> <li><p><strong>Prototyping</strong>. Every project or a new big feature starts with a prototype, which requires one or two people sitting next to each other, thinking, and experimenting. We tried to break this piece of work into smaller parts, but failed. It <a href="/2014/10/06/software-project-lifecycle.html">seems</a> that this process has to be done as a single solid work package.</p></li> <li><p><strong>UI/UX</strong>. We were mostly working with server-side Java/Ruby/C++ projects for the last few years and didn’t have many opportunities to apply micro-tasking to the UI/UX jobs. However, whatever we did try never really worked: graphic designers weren’t able to decompose their tasks into smaller parts.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Customers</strong>. We <a href="/2014/04/26/incremental-requirements-with-requs.html">tried</a> to decompose the task of eliciting requirements from our clients and failed a few times. Maybe our clients were stupid (I doubt that), maybe requirements were too complex, or maybe our system analysts were not professional enough. The bottom line is that we realized that such a task must be done as a solid piece of work, without any decomposition.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Fire-fighting</strong>. When the speed of delivery is the most important concern, micro-tasking doesn’t work for us. The overhead for dispatching and specifying tasks was taking too much time. When something is really urgent, we have to do the traditional macro-tasking and just “make it work.” Then we get back to micro-tasking.</p></li></ul><p>Everything else, including programming, unit testing, manual testing, performance/load testing, integration testing, deployment, code review, documentation, and even training, can and must be managed via micro tasks.</p><h2 id="what-benefits-do-we-get">What benefits do we get?</h2><p>The most important benefit of micro-tasking is that the project becomes more manageable, as was mentioned above. Here is a more detailed break down:</p><ul> <li><p><strong>Money works</strong>. When tasks are very small, we can use <a href="/2014/09/24/why-monetary-awards-dont-work.html">good old dollar bills</a> to motivate programmers. We can throw away literally <a href="/2015/03/02/team-morale-myths-and-reality.html">all other</a> instruments.</p></li> <li><p><strong>We pay less</strong>. We seriously lower our expenses, even though hourly rates of our programmers are <a href="/2014/10/29/how-much-do-you-cost.html">higher</a> than many other projects can afford. I did a more or less <a href="/2014/04/11/cost-of-loc.html">detailed analysis</a> a few years ago, which demonstrated that our projects were 30 (!) times more cost efficient than traditional ones.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Motivation is high</strong>. Despite a very common stereotype that small and isolated tasks demotivate their performers, we see quite the opposite reaction: programmers are excited when it finally becomes possible to work within well-defined and explicit boundaries, independently, and in isolation. Not all of them, <a href="/2018/01/09/micro-budgeting.html">though</a>. My personal observation is: only 25% of them can understand and enjoy micro-tasking. Others are either not professional enough or spoiled by <a href="/2015/10/06/how-to-be-good-office-slave.html">office slavery</a>, where it’s possible to do almost nothing and stay very respected and well rewarded.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Turnover is not painful</strong>. To make micro-tasking possible the management has to learn how to specify them: explicitly, unambiguously, and fast. When such a high level of transparency, formality, and agility (at the same time) is achieved, the project becomes less dependent on <a href="/2015/12/29/turnover-is-good-for-maintainability.html">experts</a>. We lose the fear of losing people, because almost everything we need to know about the project is inside our task tracking system and project documentation.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Easier to parallel</strong>. Smaller tasks are easier to delegate to a larger amount of programmers. In some projects we sometimes have over 40 programmers at the same time, while the amount of tasks is relatively small (up to 200).</p></li> <li><p><strong>Metrics work</strong>. When one programmer closes 40-50 tasks per week and another one closes 5-10, it does mean something, keeping in mind that all tasks are almost equal in size. We use this metric (and <a href="https://www.0crat.com/gang">a few others</a>) to make organizational and discipline decisions. In a macro-tasking environment almost no HR metrics really work.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Quality is enforceable</strong>. Large amounts of small tasks implies that we constantly and frequently close them. Each closure is an important point for quality control. That’s exactly where we have the ability to say “No” and reject the deliverables that violate our quality standards. With big tasks this “No” is much more painful for programmers.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Risks are acceptable</strong>. It’s impossible to accept the risk of the entire apartment redesign failure, since its cost is too high—a few thousand dollars. However, it is absolutely affordable to accept a risk of a kitchen lamp installation. Even if it falls and breaks, we will spend a few dollars and buy a new one.

That’s why you have to resort to the last possible measure—micromanagement. Why is the project not manageable? Because its scope is not broken down into pieces. It contains a large single job called “Redesign The Apartment.”</p><p>One of the key success factors for manageability is the famous 0/100 rule, which requires any task to be either “in progress” or “complete.” There can be nothing in the middle. When such a rule is in place, the task can be delegated to its performer and they can become responsible for its completion, they can be trusted.</p><p>We can’t “trust” our single large task to the performer, simply because it’s too big to be trusted. If they fail, the cost of failure will be too high. We have to take a <em>micro</em>-scope and get into the task to manage it from the inside, annoying its performers, whom we are supposed to trust. The micromanagement we do is <em>inevitable</em>, because the scope is not broken down.</p><p>Scope decomposition was invented mostly in order to solve this very problem: to make the project more manageable. We need small tasks in the scope in order to be able to delegate them and never go inside in order to check what’s going on there, who is doing what, why, and where.</p><p>The smaller the tasks we can break the scope into, the better.</p><h2 id="how-small-can-tasks-be">How small can tasks be?</h2><p>In our projects we break project scope into tasks of 30 minutes each. This may sound too extreme for you, but it works for us. We call them micro-tasks. We started to practice micro-tasking about seven years ago. We experimented with different task sizes, from 10 hours to 15 minutes, but eventually came down to 30 minutes.</p><p>When tasks are bigger, we lose the manageability and simply get back to macro-tasking. When tasks are smaller, the context switching overhead becomes too annoying.</p><p>In our experience, a senior programmer, if fully dedicated to a project, completes 6-10 tasks a day. This means that they spend 3-5 hours working, while the rest of the time is spent on doing something else. This is a much more effective use of work time than we can achieve with traditional macro-tasking management, where programmers barely work for two hours a day, spending the rest of their time on something else (my personal observation).</p><h2 id="what-obstacles-did-we-have">What obstacles did we have?</h2><p>If you decide to go for micro-tasking, you will most likely have the same or similar obstacles that we’ve had. Here is a short list of them and my advice, which may help if one day you decide to break a “Develop a Mobile App” task into, say, 2,500+ micro tasks:</p><ul> <li><p><strong>Vagueness</strong>. Definition of done, exit criteria, requirements, expectations—there are many names, which are all about our inability to define what exactly we expect programmers to do. Software development by definition includes a lot of unknowns, creativity, experiments, and risks. Programmers will tell you that they can’t guarantee anything in most cases, and can’t really give any valid promises. We solve that by <a href="/2010/03/04/pdd.html">PDD</a>.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Distraction</strong>. Programmers are used to doing many different things at the same time: they write code, help others, watch YouTube, scroll Facebook, swear at Reddit, and read my blog. Initially most of them won’t like the idea of having explicit tasks in front of them, simply because they put a structure on their work time, making it much more visible to the management. They will tell you that they have many other things to do aside from your bloody tasks. We solve that by <a href="/2014/04/17/how-xdsd-is-different.html">paying by result</a> and <a href="/2014/10/07/stop-chatting-start-coding.html">prohibition of chitchats</a>.</p></li></ul><aside class="quote">They are simply spoiled by the traditional macro-tasking where they are paid by the month and nobody really controls their results.</aside><ul> <li><p><strong>Laziness</strong>. Just like that apartment designers, programmers also love to get paid and do nothing. Who doesn’t, right? They will tell you that their work is more complicated than you think, that they need much more time, that they need to investigate the problem first, that reading documentation also takes a lot of time, etc. They are simply spoiled by the <a href="/2015/10/06/how-to-be-good-office-slave.html">traditional macro-tasking</a> where they are paid by the month and nobody really controls their results. They are used to being <del>office slaves</del> lazy. We solve that by <a href="/2014/04/17/how-xdsd-is-different.html">paying by result</a> and the lazy ones simply quit.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Responsibility</strong>. Micro-tasking will make individual results visible. When tasks are large people tend to work with them in groups and it’s unclear exactly who is responsible for failures and successes. Smaller tasks emphasize mistakes and make people “pay” for them. Not necessarily with cash, but definitely some way or other. Most programmers will find this concept very new and disturbing—they’ve almost never paid for their own mistakes before and never had their own tasks. The responsibility was always spread across the group. We solve that by <a href="/2014/09/24/why-monetary-awards-dont-work.html">monetary rewards and punishments</a>, which make them very motivated and failure-ready.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Resentment</strong>. This is one of the most popular and the most annoying of problems: they will tell you that they are “not monkeys.” They will actually combine all problems listed above and say that the right way to solve them is to give programmers freedom and let them do their job, since they are smart enough and don’t need any management from the top. And they will mostly be saying it quite honestly, with no intent to manipulate. The thing is that they are used to macro-tasking and believe that this is the only and the right way. I’m trying to solve this by writing this very blog post.</p></li></ul><p>There could be something else, but this is a more or less an exhaustive list of the problems we were faced with.</p><h2 id="where-micro-tasking-didnt-work">Where micro-tasking didn’t work</h2><p>Obviously, any approach has its pros and cons. Micro-tasking seems to be the most effective management paradigm for us. However, it’s not applicable everywhere, according to our experience. There are territories where we failed to apply it.</p><ul> <li><p><strong>Prototyping</strong>. Every project or a new big feature starts with a prototype, which requires one or two people sitting next to each other, thinking, and experimenting. We tried to break this piece of work into smaller parts, but failed. It <a href="/2014/10/06/software-project-lifecycle.html">seems</a> that this process has to be done as a single solid work package.</p></li> <li><p><strong>UI/UX</strong>. We were mostly working with server-side Java/Ruby/C++ projects for the last few years and didn’t have many opportunities to apply micro-tasking to the UI/UX jobs. However, whatever we did try never really worked: graphic designers weren’t able to decompose their tasks into smaller parts.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Customers</strong>. We <a href="/2014/04/26/incremental-requirements-with-requs.html">tried</a> to decompose the task of eliciting requirements from our clients and failed a few times. Maybe our clients were stupid (I doubt that), maybe requirements were too complex, or maybe our system analysts were not professional enough. The bottom line is that we realized that such a task must be done as a solid piece of work, without any decomposition.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Fire-fighting</strong>. When the speed of delivery is the most important concern, micro-tasking doesn’t work for us. The overhead for dispatching and specifying tasks was taking too much time. When something is really urgent, we have to do the traditional macro-tasking and just “make it work.” Then we get back to micro-tasking.</p></li></ul><p>Everything else, including programming, unit testing, manual testing, performance/load testing, integration testing, deployment, code review, documentation, and even training, can and must be managed via micro tasks.</p><h2 id="what-benefits-do-we-get">What benefits do we get?</h2><p>The most important benefit of micro-tasking is that the project becomes more manageable, as was mentioned above. Here is a more detailed break down:</p><ul> <li><p><strong>Money works</strong>. When tasks are very small, we can use <a href="/2014/09/24/why-monetary-awards-dont-work.html">good old dollar bills</a> to motivate programmers. We can throw away literally <a href="/2015/03/02/team-morale-myths-and-reality.html">all other</a> instruments.</p></li> <li><p><strong>We pay less</strong>. We seriously lower our expenses, even though hourly rates of our programmers are <a href="/2014/10/29/how-much-do-you-cost.html">higher</a> than many other projects can afford. I did a more or less <a href="/2014/04/11/cost-of-loc.html">detailed analysis</a> a few years ago, which demonstrated that our projects were 30 (!) times more cost efficient than traditional ones.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Motivation is high</strong>. Despite a very common stereotype that small and isolated tasks demotivate their performers, we see quite the opposite reaction: programmers are excited when it finally becomes possible to work within well-defined and explicit boundaries, independently, and in isolation. Not all of them, <a href="/2018/01/09/micro-budgeting.html">though</a>. My personal observation is: only 25% of them can understand and enjoy micro-tasking. Others are either not professional enough or spoiled by <a href="/2015/10/06/how-to-be-good-office-slave.html">office slavery</a>, where it’s possible to do almost nothing and stay very respected and well rewarded.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Turnover is not painful</strong>. To make micro-tasking possible the management has to learn how to specify them: explicitly, unambiguously, and fast. When such a high level of transparency, formality, and agility (at the same time) is achieved, the project becomes less dependent on <a href="/2015/12/29/turnover-is-good-for-maintainability.html">experts</a>. We lose the fear of losing people, because almost everything we need to know about the project is inside our task tracking system and project documentation.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Easier to parallel</strong>. Smaller tasks are easier to delegate to a larger amount of programmers. In some projects we sometimes have over 40 programmers at the same time, while the amount of tasks is relatively small (up to 200).</p></li> <li><p><strong>Metrics work</strong>. When one programmer closes 40-50 tasks per week and another one closes 5-10, it does mean something, keeping in mind that all tasks are almost equal in size. We use this metric (and <a href="https://www.0crat.com/gang">a few others</a>) to make organizational and discipline decisions. In a macro-tasking environment almost no HR metrics really work.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Quality is enforceable</strong>. Large amounts of small tasks implies that we constantly and frequently close them. Each closure is an important point for quality control. That’s exactly where we have the ability to say “No” and reject the deliverables that violate our quality standards. With big tasks this “No” is much more painful for programmers.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Risks are acceptable</strong>. It’s impossible to accept the risk of the entire apartment redesign failure, since its cost is too high—a few thousand dollars. However, it is absolutely affordable to accept a risk of a kitchen lamp installation. Even if it falls and breaks, we will spend a few dollars and buy a new one. We don’t need to control the “lamp person”—we have a luxury to delegate and trust.</p></li></ul><p>The benefits programmers get overlap with our benefits.

You look at their &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/03/08/pimp-up-your-resume.html&quot;&gt;resumes&lt;/a&gt; and feel excited. They know JavaScript, and DevOps, and GitHub, and even Big Data. They definitely are the best. Moreover, they’ve been in this business for ten years. What else do you need, right?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Finally, you lose when you realize that it's their software, not yours.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;Second, you &lt;em&gt;pay&lt;/em&gt; them.

You &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/01/26/happy-boss-false-objective.html&quot;&gt;feel excited&lt;/a&gt; to see how your money turns into the software that works. They demonstrate new versions regularly. There are bugs, of course, but this is how it &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/06/18/good-programmers-bug-free.html&quot;&gt;should be&lt;/a&gt;, right? They &lt;a href=&quot;/2017/01/10/how-to-teach-customers.html&quot;&gt;explain&lt;/a&gt; everything to you and you keep paying.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Finally, you &lt;em&gt;lose&lt;/em&gt; when you realize that it’s their software, &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/05/04/how-to-protect-business-idea.html&quot;&gt;not yours&lt;/a&gt;.

Your frustration is enormous and you’re ready to go back to the first step—you trust these new guys, because they definitely seem legit, not like those previous crooks.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Seems familiar?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What is the alternative, you ask?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Don’t trust.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Instead, before you start a project, hire an &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/12/18/independent-technical-reviews.html&quot;&gt;independent expert&lt;/a&gt;, who will regularly (ideally, every two weeks) review everything these guys are doing and tell you where and how you &lt;em&gt;may&lt;/em&gt; lose.

Simply put, what should I do in order for a task to be considered as completed?</p><aside class="quote">I hate to be afraid, especially if I don't really know what I'm supposed to be afraid of.</aside><p><strong>Responsibility borders</strong>. I hate to be afraid, especially if I don’t really know what I’m supposed to be afraid of. I want to know what my possible <a href="/2016/01/05/how-to-punish-employees.html">punishments</a> are and when they will occur. I need to know the <a href="/2015/10/13/competition-without-rules.html">rules of the game</a>. Say I commit a bug into the code and we lose $100,000. What will happen to me? Or say I don’t finish a task by the deadline. Or I don’t answer an email. Or I miss a bug during a code review. Or I break the <code>master</code> branch. What are the consequences? Their clear explanation will seriously boost my motivation.</p><p><strong>Open source</strong>. I’m a big fan of <a href="/2015/12/22/why-dont-you-contribute-to-open-source.html">open source</a>. If you are not, I most probably won’t like working for you. If your company makes some code open and I am part of that process, that will seriously affect my motivation, because I will achieve two goals at the same time: make money and become more popular in the open source world. Working in purely closed software projects is a demotivating factor for me.</p><p><strong>Project visibility</strong>. I’d love to see my name close to a project that is visible to the world. And it doesn’t necessarily have to be Google or Facebook. Actually, in those companies regular programmers are way less visible than in smaller startups. So, unless you make me VP of Engineering, I won’t consider a position in a big company interesting in that respect. The most interesting project would be a small startup with an ambitious goal and high exposure in the media. Being there even as a regular programmer will motivate me a lot.</p><p><strong>Clear hierarchy</strong>. Yes, I’ve heard about <a href="/2016/02/18/holacracy-autocracy.html">holacracy</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flat_organization">flat</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flat_organization#Self-managing_teams">self-managing</a> teams, and other modern ideas. I hate them all. I believe that any management is based on <a href="/2016/09/27/command-control-innovate.html">power and force</a>, and the best way to avoid negative aspects of these rather violent concepts is to organize and structure them. Without a clear and well defined hierarchy of roles a team very quickly turns into a <a href="/2015/10/13/competition-without-rules.html">snake pit</a>, with politics, backstabbing and behind-the-scenes games. So, if you can’t tell me exactly who is my boss and what the chain of command is in the group, I simply won’t consider this place seriously and won’t be motivated.</p><p><strong>No Agile/Scrum, please</strong>. Do I need to say <a href="/2016/07/11/mistakes-in-agile-manifesto.html">anything</a> else here?</p><p><strong>Payment structure</strong>. I hate to guess about money, I prefer to know the numbers and the logic behind them. I want to know <a href="/2014/09/24/why-monetary-awards-dont-work.html">exactly</a> how much I’m going to get and when. I want to know when the numbers will go up and how I can affect that. Also, I’d like to know the payment policy of the company and, ideally, salaries or rates of the people around me. Jealousy, which arises with the surprising information that someone is getting more than I do, doesn’t motivate at all, even if my pay is <a href="/2014/10/29/how-much-do-you-cost.html">decent</a>. It would be much easier for me if I knew everything from the first day.</p><aside class="quote">I hate working for big ideas, if they are not mine.</aside><p><strong>Business transparency</strong>. I hate working for big ideas, if they are not mine. Mostly because I know that almost all of them <a href="/2016/01/12/good-programmers-dont-work-for-equity.html">fail</a>. Working for a failure and <a href="/2015/03/02/team-morale-myths-and-reality.html">being told</a> that our future is bright doesn’t really motivate me, at all. That’s why I would expect you to tell me honestly why a meeting with investors took three hours instead of one and why the door was so tightly closed. Also, I would want to know why our CTO quit a few weeks ago and now works for our competitors. I’d like to know our honest situation in the market and why the web traffic stats are going down. In other words, I’m either a <a href="/2015/10/06/how-to-be-good-office-slave.html">slave</a> kept in the dark, or I know <a href="/2015/03/02/team-morale-myths-and-reality.html">the truth</a> and I’m motivated (no matter how ugly the truth is).</p><p><strong>Payments per results</strong>. I haven’t seen this anywhere, except with my own projects, but I believe it’s how good teams should be structured: everybody must be paid <a href="/2015/07/21/hourly-pay-modern-slavery.html">for results</a>, not per hour/week/month/year. If you want me to be truly motivated you have to invent a payment structure where my paychecks will correspond to my results. I do realize that this may require you to change the entire management system, so I don’t absolutely insist. But you have to remember that as long as you pay me only for my time I will try to do my best to <del>steal from you</del> use it for my <a href="/2017/01/24/career-advice.html">own benefit</a>.</p><p><strong>Career path</strong>. I have no problem starting as a junior developer, but I have to know exactly what my future is and when it will happen. I want to become a CTO, no matter what. And it’s not about the title. It’s about the amount of technical <a href="/2014/10/12/who-is-software-architect.html">authority</a> and <a href="/2015/05/11/software-architect-responsibilities.html">responsibility</a> I will have. I want it all. If I don’t see a clear path to achieve that, I will be very demotivated and will treat my job as temporary. I will always be looking for a <a href="/2017/01/24/career-advice.html">better place</a>, where it’s easier to become a CTO. So it’s your job to make that career growth obvious for me. If it will never be possible for me to become the CTO, make that obvious too. The truth is better anyway.</p><aside class="quote">A strong manager is someone who is ready to fight for their own ideas, rights, thoughts, and decisions.</aside><p><strong>A strong boss</strong>. This is probably the most important requirement I would have. I can’t work under a <a href="/2015/09/22/micromanagement.html">weak manager</a>, it will seriously demotivate me from the first day. I will probably write another blog post about what a “strong manager” is, but in a nutshell it’s someone who is ready to fight for his or her own ideas, rights, thoughts, decisions, etc. A weak manager is one who is swimming with the current. Working under such a manager is a huge frustration and a waste of time. I will be demotivated and no amount of money will keep me interested.</p><p>These things don’t matter at all, I won’t even ask about them:</p><ul> <li>Mission and vision of the company</li> <li>Business domain</li> <li>Tech stack</li> <li>Location</li> <li>Company size or structure</li> <li>Race, gender, sexual orientation, religious or political beliefs of people in the team</li> <li>Financial status of the company</li></ul><p>Of course, I don’t think that this list is applicable for everybody. Other programmers may have some other points or may disagree with mine.</p><p>P.S. I would most probably stay away from a business involved in something I consider unethical, like corruption, gambling, crime, etc.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">What motivates you best of all? <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/motivation?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#motivation</a></p>--- Yegor Bugayenko (@yegor256) <a href="https://twitter.com/yegor256/status/1003355914555002881?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 3, 2018</a></blockquote> <script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p><nav class="buttons notranslate desktop-only"> <a href="http://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://www.yegor256.com/2017/09/19/what-motivates-me.html" title="Share on Facebook" class="button" rel="nofollow"> <span class="count count-facebook">0</span> <i class="icon icon-facebook notranslate" aria-hidden="true"></i> </a> <a href="https://twitter.com/share?url=https://www.yegor256.com/2017/09/19/what-motivates-me.html&amp;text=What+Motivates+Me+as+a+Programmer" title="Share on Twitter" class="button" rel="nofollow"> <span class="count count-twitter">0</span> <i class="icon icon-twitter notranslate" aria-hidden="true"></i> </a> <a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=https://www.yegor256.com/2017/09/19/what-motivates-me.html" title="Share on Google+" class="button" rel="nofollow"> <span class="count count-googleplus">0</span> <i class="icon icon-googleplus notranslate" aria-hidden="true"></i> </a> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/cws/share?url=https://www.yegor256.com/2017/09/19/what-motivates-me.html" title="Share on LinkedIn" class="button" rel="nofollow"> <span class="count count-linkedin">0</span> <i class="icon icon-linkedin notranslate" aria-hidden="true"></i> </a> <a href="http://reddit.com/submit?url=https://www.yegor256.com/2017/09/19/what-motivates-me.html%3F2017-38&amp;title=What+Motivates+Me+as+a+Programmer" title="Share on Reddit" class="button" rel="nofollow"> <span class="count count-reddit">0</span> <i class="icon icon-reddit notranslate" aria-hidden="true"></i> </a> <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/submitlink?u=https://www.yegor256.com/2017/09/19/what-motivates-me.html%3F2017-38&amp;t=What+Motivates+Me+as+a+Programmer" title="Share on Hacker News" class="button" rel="nofollow"> <span class="count count-hackernews">0</span> <i class="icon icon-hackernews notranslate" aria-hidden="true"></i> </a> </nav> </header> <article class="main" itemprop="articleBody"><div ><p>I wrote a number of <a href="/tag/sarcasm.html">sarcastic articles</a> about management and motivation, where some traditional and very popular practices were criticized.

Without a clear and well defined hierarchy of roles a team very quickly turns into a <a href="/2015/10/13/competition-without-rules.html">snake pit</a>, with politics, backstabbing and behind-the-scenes games. So, if you can’t tell me exactly who is my boss and what the chain of command is in the group, I simply won’t consider this place seriously and won’t be motivated.</p><p><strong>No Agile/Scrum, please</strong>. Do I need to say <a href="/2016/07/11/mistakes-in-agile-manifesto.html">anything</a> else here?</p><p><strong>Payment structure</strong>. I hate to guess about money, I prefer to know the numbers and the logic behind them. I want to know <a href="/2014/09/24/why-monetary-awards-dont-work.html">exactly</a> how much I’m going to get and when. I want to know when the numbers will go up and how I can affect that. Also, I’d like to know the payment policy of the company and, ideally, salaries or rates of the people around me. Jealousy, which arises with the surprising information that someone is getting more than I do, doesn’t motivate at all, even if my pay is <a href="/2014/10/29/how-much-do-you-cost.html">decent</a>. It would be much easier for me if I knew everything from the first day.</p><aside class="quote">I hate working for big ideas, if they are not mine.</aside><p><strong>Business transparency</strong>. I hate working for big ideas, if they are not mine. Mostly because I know that almost all of them <a href="/2016/01/12/good-programmers-dont-work-for-equity.html">fail</a>. Working for a failure and <a href="/2015/03/02/team-morale-myths-and-reality.html">being told</a> that our future is bright doesn’t really motivate me, at all. That’s why I would expect you to tell me honestly why a meeting with investors took three hours instead of one and why the door was so tightly closed. Also, I would want to know why our CTO quit a few weeks ago and now works for our competitors. I’d like to know our honest situation in the market and why the web traffic stats are going down. In other words, I’m either a <a href="/2015/10/06/how-to-be-good-office-slave.html">slave</a> kept in the dark, or I know <a href="/2015/03/02/team-morale-myths-and-reality.html">the truth</a> and I’m motivated (no matter how ugly the truth is).</p><p><strong>Payments per results</strong>. I haven’t seen this anywhere, except with my own projects, but I believe it’s how good teams should be structured: everybody must be paid <a href="/2015/07/21/hourly-pay-modern-slavery.html">for results</a>, not per hour/week/month/year. If you want me to be truly motivated you have to invent a payment structure where my paychecks will correspond to my results. I do realize that this may require you to change the entire management system, so I don’t absolutely insist. But you have to remember that as long as you pay me only for my time I will try to do my best to <del>steal from you</del> use it for my <a href="/2017/01/24/career-advice.html">own benefit</a>.</p><p><strong>Career path</strong>. I have no problem starting as a junior developer, but I have to know exactly what my future is and when it will happen. I want to become a CTO, no matter what. And it’s not about the title. It’s about the amount of technical <a href="/2014/10/12/who-is-software-architect.html">authority</a> and <a href="/2015/05/11/software-architect-responsibilities.html">responsibility</a> I will have. I want it all. If I don’t see a clear path to achieve that, I will be very demotivated and will treat my job as temporary. I will always be looking for a <a href="/2017/01/24/career-advice.html">better place</a>, where it’s easier to become a CTO. So it’s your job to make that career growth obvious for me. If it will never be possible for me to become the CTO, make that obvious too. The truth is better anyway.</p><aside class="quote">A strong manager is someone who is ready to fight for their own ideas, rights, thoughts, and decisions.</aside><p><strong>A strong boss</strong>. This is probably the most important requirement I would have. I can’t work under a <a href="/2015/09/22/micromanagement.html">weak manager</a>, it will seriously demotivate me from the first day. I will probably write another blog post about what a “strong manager” is, but in a nutshell it’s someone who is ready to fight for his or her own ideas, rights, thoughts, decisions, etc. A weak manager is one who is swimming with the current. Working under such a manager is a huge frustration and a waste of time.

Not that I think we shouldn’t be nice. Not at all. But I do think that “being nice” is not a solution for organizational, management, marketing, sales, or business development problems. Moreover, in most cases it is actually &lt;em&gt;not safe&lt;/em&gt; for founders to be nice.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;!--more--&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;jb_picture&quot;&gt;&lt;img itemprop=&quot;image&quot; alt=&quot;Scarecrow (1973) by Jerry Schatzberg&quot; src=&quot;/images/2017/08/scarecrow.jpg&quot; longdesc=&quot;#04c96f77&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption id=&quot;04c96f77&quot;&gt;Scarecrow (1973) by Jerry Schatzberg&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Graham in his article quotes a founder who explains his worries about being “fundamentally soft-hearted and tending to give away too much for free.” Then he suggests the founder should not worry too much, because “as long as you build something good enough to spread by word of mouth, you’ll have a hyperlinear growth curve.” In other words, don’t worry about your &lt;em&gt;softness&lt;/em&gt; and instead focus on building a great product—your efforts will be appreciated. But will this really work in the modern world?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It will, provided you’re a talented mathematician, or a composer, or maybe a writer, where your success doesn’t really depend on people close to you, like employees, partners, and investors. However, developing a business is a different story, where success mostly depends on your ability to generate &lt;em&gt;profit&lt;/em&gt;, which, by definition, is “taking more and returning less.” What kind of a soft heart will be happy to do that?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;In a nutshell, we are either soft-hearted or successful.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://foolishnessfile.com/soft-hearted-mistakes/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;7 Soft Hearted Mistakes Startup Founders Make&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; perfectly summarizes how softness may become a weakness, if we fail to take it under control. In a nutshell, we are either soft-hearted or successful. This “weakness” is affecting more people every year, since the entire world, especially its &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/thinking-man/millennial-men-have-gone-soft--but-its-not-our-fault/&quot;&gt;male part&lt;/a&gt;, is tending to soften up, mostly thanks to the rapidly growing quality of life.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For some of us, who, like that founder, are “fundamentally soft-hearted,” doing business and generating profit is a very stressful activity. We have to do what goes against our inner self and take advantage of others. Telling us that it is perfectly safe to “be nice” in this situation is not ethical—this disarms us and makes us vulnerable in front of those who don’t have the “disease of soft-heartedness.” Is there a better recipe out there to heal our illness?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Even though I’m trying to think of myself as not a weak person, I have plenty of soft-heartedness disease symptoms. For example, I feel guilty when:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;I fire an employee&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;I negotiate someone down&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;I punish someone&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;I don’t pick up the phone&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;I say “No” to an offer&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;I don’t trust people&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;I break up with a girl&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;I don’t return my mom’s calls&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Any successful business person, including Paul Graham, who deals with hundreds of startups every year, would tell you that in order to achieve something you have to take many steps that will make many people around you &lt;em&gt;unhappy&lt;/em&gt;. You have to fire people, say “No” to them, punish them, never return their phone calls, and rarely trust anyone. But we’re “fundamentally soft-hearted” and simply can’t do that every day—it’s too stressful for us. However, we also want to be successful in business! We don’t want to be mathematicians, or composers, or just Java programmers. We want to move up in business. What do we do?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Let me share the recipe I found for myself.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;The only possible way to get rid of guilt is to replace it with a greater guilt.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;Obviously, we develop soft-heartedness when we grow up, mostly under the influence of our parents. As kids we quickly learn that in order to survive and have something to eat we must make those grown-ups happy, or at least not disappoint them. Later on we call this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevenberglas/2012/06/07/6-signs-you-are-suffering-from-guilt-and-probably-dont-know-it/#2920e0b67a24&quot;&gt;guilt-driven behavior&lt;/a&gt; “soft-heartedness” and become &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lifehack.org/articles/communication/8-problems-you-face-when-you-have-soft-heart.html&quot;&gt;proud of it&lt;/a&gt;. But I believe it’s unfixable. Those who were traumatized by guilt in their childhood will never be able to offend somebody and walk away without any negative feelings. They are scarred forever.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The only possible way to get rid of guilt is to replace it with a greater guilt. For example, you just bought two ice cream cups and a friend asks you to give him one. You can’t say “No” because you would feel guilty for making him unhappy. But you remember that your mom told you to buy two cups and bring both of them home. You would feel even more guilt if you made your mom unhappy. So you say “No” to your friend and run home. Of course, you also can’t eat the ice cream yourself, even though you want it—you are afraid to make your mother unhappy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The same principle may be applied to business. But instead of having a controlling parent you can define your own “rules of doing business.” Those rules will be stronger than any particular situation you’re facing at any particular moment. For example, you can decide when and why you answer your emails and phone calls, what &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/09/16/how-to-fire-someone-right.html&quot;&gt;should happen&lt;/a&gt; for your employee to be discharged, how exactly you &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/01/05/how-to-punish-employees.html&quot;&gt;punish&lt;/a&gt; your employees, how your relationship with partners are &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/05/17/convertible-notes.html&quot;&gt;structured&lt;/a&gt;, etc. This document, or set of documents, will be more important for you than any particular person or situation. You will feel much more guilt for disobeying the rules than for making someone unhappy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At least this is what works for me. Call it self-discipline or a systematic approach to doing business, but in reality it’s just a countermeasure against guilt.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To summarize, and to answer the question whether it is safe for a business person to be nice, I would say that it is very unsafe. But &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; being nice is obviously not a solution either, because anyone asking this question clearly wants to be nice. Thus, the only solution I managed to find is a personal code of conduct, which helps me be effective and not stressed at the same time.&lt;/p&gt; " /> <meta name="keywords" content="next, path, output, content, previous, url, relative_path, id, collection, excerpt, draft, categories, layout, title, date, place, tags, description, keywords, image, jb_picture, buffer, slug, ext" /> <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1"/> <meta name="google-site-verification" content="JEj_gQr2CPe2QKGw8XdMz0R7VboQIUbX3FlM-lwTq-8" /> <meta name="author" content="Yegor Bugayenko"> <meta name="article:published_time" content="2017-08-22 00:00:00 +0000"> <meta name="og:site_name" content="Yegor Bugayenko"/> <meta name="og:type" content="article" /> <meta name="og:locale" content="en_US" /> <meta name="twitter:account_id" content="4503599630178231" /> <meta name="twitter:creator" content="@yegor256"/> <meta name="twitter:site" content="@yegor256"/> <meta name="twitter:title" property="og:title" content="To Be Nice or Not to Be Nice?"/> <meta name="twitter:description" property="og:description" content="&lt;p&gt;I stumbled upon this two-year-old article &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.paulgraham.com/safe.html&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why It’s Safe for Founders to Be Nice&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, written by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/paulg&quot;&gt;Paul Graham&lt;/a&gt; (a co-founder of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ycombinator.com/&quot;&gt;Y Combinator&lt;/a&gt;), whom I honestly respect, and I decided to explain why I disagree.

href="http://www.ycombinator.com/">Y Combinator</a>), whom I honestly respect, and I decided to explain why I disagree. Not that I think we shouldn’t be nice. Not at all. But I do think that “being nice” is not a solution for organizational, management, marketing, sales, or business development problems. Moreover, in most cases it is actually <em>not safe</em> for founders to be nice.</p><figure class="jb_picture"><img itemprop="image" alt="Scarecrow (1973) by Jerry Schatzberg" src="/images/2017/08/scarecrow.jpg" longdesc="#04c96f77" /><figcaption id="04c96f77">Scarecrow (1973) by Jerry Schatzberg</figcaption></figure><p>Graham in his article quotes a founder who explains his worries about being “fundamentally soft-hearted and tending to give away too much for free.” Then he suggests the founder should not worry too much, because “as long as you build something good enough to spread by word of mouth, you’ll have a hyperlinear growth curve.” In other words, don’t worry about your <em>softness</em> and instead focus on building a great product—your efforts will be appreciated. But will this really work in the modern world?</p><p>It will, provided you’re a talented mathematician, or a composer, or maybe a writer, where your success doesn’t really depend on people close to you, like employees, partners, and investors. However, developing a business is a different story, where success mostly depends on your ability to generate <em>profit</em>, which, by definition, is “taking more and returning less.” What kind of a soft heart will be happy to do that?</p><aside class="quote">In a nutshell, we are either soft-hearted or successful.</aside><p><a href="http://foolishnessfile.com/soft-hearted-mistakes/"><em>7 Soft Hearted Mistakes Startup Founders Make</em></a> perfectly summarizes how softness may become a weakness, if we fail to take it under control. In a nutshell, we are either soft-hearted or successful. This “weakness” is affecting more people every year, since the entire world, especially its <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/thinking-man/millennial-men-have-gone-soft--but-its-not-our-fault/">male part</a>, is tending to soften up, mostly thanks to the rapidly growing quality of life.</p><p>For some of us, who, like that founder, are “fundamentally soft-hearted,” doing business and generating profit is a very stressful activity. We have to do what goes against our inner self and take advantage of others. Telling us that it is perfectly safe to “be nice” in this situation is not ethical—this disarms us and makes us vulnerable in front of those who don’t have the “disease of soft-heartedness.” Is there a better recipe out there to heal our illness?</p><p>Even though I’m trying to think of myself as not a weak person, I have plenty of soft-heartedness disease symptoms. For example, I feel guilty when:</p><ul> <li>I fire an employee</li> <li>I negotiate someone down</li> <li>I punish someone</li> <li>I don’t pick up the phone</li> <li>I say “No” to an offer</li> <li>I don’t trust people</li> <li>I break up with a girl</li> <li>I don’t return my mom’s calls</li></ul><p>Any successful business person, including Paul Graham, who deals with hundreds of startups every year, would tell you that in order to achieve something you have to take many steps that will make many people around you <em>unhappy</em>. You have to fire people, say “No” to them, punish them, never return their phone calls, and rarely trust anyone. But we’re “fundamentally soft-hearted” and simply can’t do that every day—it’s too stressful for us. However, we also want to be successful in business! We don’t want to be mathematicians, or composers, or just Java programmers. We want to move up in business. What do we do?</p><p>Let me share the recipe I found for myself.</p><aside class="quote">The only possible way to get rid of guilt is to replace it with a greater guilt.</aside><p>Obviously, we develop soft-heartedness when we grow up, mostly under the influence of our parents. As kids we quickly learn that in order to survive and have something to eat we must make those grown-ups happy, or at least not disappoint them. Later on we call this <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevenberglas/2012/06/07/6-signs-you-are-suffering-from-guilt-and-probably-dont-know-it/#2920e0b67a24">guilt-driven behavior</a> “soft-heartedness” and become <a href="http://www.lifehack.org/articles/communication/8-problems-you-face-when-you-have-soft-heart.html">proud of it</a>. But I believe it’s unfixable. Those who were traumatized by guilt in their childhood will never be able to offend somebody and walk away without any negative feelings. They are scarred forever.</p><p>The only possible way to get rid of guilt is to replace it with a greater guilt. For example, you just bought two ice cream cups and a friend asks you to give him one. You can’t say “No” because you would feel guilty for making him unhappy. But you remember that your mom told you to buy two cups and bring both of them home. You would feel even more guilt if you made your mom unhappy. So you say “No” to your friend and run home. Of course, you also can’t eat the ice cream yourself, even though you want it—you are afraid to make your mother unhappy.</p><p>The same principle may be applied to business. But instead of having a controlling parent you can define your own “rules of doing business.” Those rules will be stronger than any particular situation you’re facing at any particular moment. For example, you can decide when and why you answer your emails and phone calls, what <a href="/2015/09/16/how-to-fire-someone-right.html">should happen</a> for your employee to be discharged, how exactly you <a href="/2016/01/05/how-to-punish-employees.html">punish</a> your employees, how your relationship with partners are <a href="/2016/05/17/convertible-notes.html">structured</a>, etc. This document, or set of documents, will be more important for you than any particular person or situation. You will feel much more guilt for disobeying the rules than for making someone unhappy.</p><p>At least this is what works for me. Call it self-discipline or a systematic approach to doing business, but in reality it’s just a countermeasure against guilt.</p><p>To summarize, and to answer the question whether it is safe for a business person to be nice, I would say that it is very unsafe. But <em>not</em> being nice is obviously not a solution either, because anyone asking this question clearly wants to be nice. Thus, the only solution I managed to find is a personal code of conduct, which helps me be effective and not stressed at the same time.</p></p><nav class="buttons notranslate desktop-only"> <a href="http://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://www.yegor256.com/2017/08/22/to-be-nice-or-not.html" title="Share on Facebook" class="button" rel="nofollow"> <span class="count count-facebook">0</span> <i class="icon icon-facebook notranslate" aria-hidden="true"></i> </a> <a href="https://twitter.com/share?url=https://www.yegor256.com/2017/08/22/to-be-nice-or-not.html&amp;text=To+Be+Nice+or+Not+to+Be+Nice%3F" title="Share on Twitter" class="button" rel="nofollow"> <span class="count count-twitter">0</span> <i class="icon icon-twitter notranslate" aria-hidden="true"></i> </a> <a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=https://www.yegor256.com/2017/08/22/to-be-nice-or-not.html" title="Share on Google+" class="button" rel="nofollow"> <span class="count count-googleplus">0</span> <i class="icon icon-googleplus notranslate" aria-hidden="true"></i> </a> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/cws/share?url=https://www.yegor256.com/2017/08/22/to-be-nice-or-not.html" title="Share on LinkedIn" class="button" rel="nofollow"> <span class="count count-linkedin">0</span> <i class="icon icon-linkedin notranslate" aria-hidden="true"></i> </a> <a href="http://reddit.com/submit?url=https://www.yegor256.com/2017/08/22/to-be-nice-or-not.html%3F2017-34&amp;title=To+Be+Nice+or+Not+to+Be+Nice%3F" title="Share on Reddit" class="button" rel="nofollow"> <span class="count count-reddit">0</span> <i class="icon icon-reddit notranslate" aria-hidden="true"></i> </a> <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/submitlink?u=https://www.yegor256.com/2017/08/22/to-be-nice-or-not.html%3F2017-34&amp;t=To+Be+Nice+or+Not+to+Be+Nice%3F" title="Share on Hacker News" class="button" rel="nofollow"> <span class="count count-hackernews">0</span> <i class="icon icon-hackernews notranslate" aria-hidden="true"></i> </a> </nav> </header> <article class="main" itemprop="articleBody"><div ><p>I stumbled upon this two-year-old article <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/safe.html"><em>Why It’s Safe for Founders to Be Nice</em></a>, written by <a href="https://twitter.com/paulg">Paul Graham</a> (a co-founder of <a href="http://www.ycombinator.com/">Y Combinator</a>), whom I honestly respect, and I decided to explain why I disagree.

Thus, the only solution I managed to find is a personal code of conduct, which helps me be effective and not stressed at the same time.</p></div></article></div><div class="wrapper"> <related-posts /></div><div class="disqus" role="complementary"><p class="disqus_hint"> Please, use <a href="https://help.disqus.com/commenting/what-html-tags-are-allowed-within-comments">syntax highlighting</a> in your comments, to make them more readable.</p><div id="disqus_thread" class="disqus-thread"> <a>&nbsp;</a></div><script> var disqus_config = function () { this.page.url = document.location.href.split('?')[0].split('#')[0].replace('https://', 'http://'); this.page.identifier = this.page.url; }; (function() { var d = document, s = d.createElement('script'); s.src = '//yegor256.disqus.com/embed.js'; s.setAttribute('data-timestamp', +new Date()); (d.head || d.body).appendChild(s); })(); </script> <noscript><div><p class="red"> JavaScript is disabled in your browser, that's why you can't see comments under this post.</p></div></noscript></div><div class="wrapper"> <footer class="footer"><p> &copy; <span itemscope="" itemprop="copyrightHolder" itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"> <span itemprop="name">Yegor Bugayenko</span> </span> 2014&ndash;<span itemprop="copyrightYear">2018</span></p></footer></div></section><div class="wrapper unprintable" style="text-align:center;margin-top:2em;"> <a href="http://www.sixnines.io/h/3ba1652f"> <img src="//www.sixnines.io/b/3ba1652f?style=flat" alt="sixnines availability badge"/> </a></div><script src="//code.jquery.com/jquery-1.9.0.min.js"></script> <script src="/js/all.js?c998b88f617"></script> <script>var disqus_shortname = 'yegor256';</script> <script id="dsq-count-scr" src="//yegor256.disqus.com/count.js" async="async"></script> <script> (function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){ (i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o), m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m) })(window,document,'script','//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga'); ga('create', 'UA-1963507-32', 'auto'); ga('send', 'pageview'); </script> <script> Cd=document;Cr="&"+Math.random();Cp="&s=1"; Cd.cookie="b=b";if(Cd.cookie)Cp+="&c=1"; Cp+="&t="+(new Date()).getTimezoneOffset(); if(self!=top)Cp+="&f=1"; </script> <script> if(navigator.javaEnabled())Cp+="&j=1"; </script> <script> if(typeof(screen)!='undefined')Cp+="&w="+screen.width+"&h="+ screen.height+"&d="+(screen.colorDepth?screen.colorDepth:screen.pixelDepth); </script> <script> Cd.write("<img src='//c.hit.ua/hit?i=95870&g=0&x=2"+Cp+Cr+ "&r="+escape(Cd.referrer)+"&u="+escape(window.location.href)+ "' border='0' wi"+"dth='1' he"+"ight='1'/>"); </script> <script type="application/ld+json"> { "@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Person", "name": "Yegor Bugayenko", "url": "https://www.yegor256.com", "sameAs": [ "https://www.facebook.com/yegor256", "https://instagram.com/yegor256", "https://www.linkedin.com/in/yegor256", "https://twitter.com/yegor256", "https://github.com/yegor256", "https://www.pinterest.com/yegor256/" ] } </script> </body> </html> <!DOCTYPE html> <html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/WebSite"> <head> <meta charset="utf-8"/> <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;No secret, &lt;del&gt;we&lt;/del&gt; you all have managers.

It’s hardly achievable to its full extent, but you can get very close. Doing something useful two hours a week and collecting a paycheck for forty hours is what a professional engineer must aim for. The other 38 hours you will spend on your own projects, your open source ideas, your education, your dreams.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The biggest problem on the road to this success is the manager, who is hired exactly to prevent this from happening. Managers use multiple instruments to catch you and force you to give them your &lt;em&gt;time&lt;/em&gt;. Here is what I did in these situations against a really annoying manager I once had:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tasks&lt;/strong&gt;. Believe it or not he would assign some coding tasks to me. I would do them very slowly or not do them at all. With a serious shortage of programmers on the market and my relatively good profile he wasn’t able to fire me. So he had to put up with the fact that I simply didn’t write any code, no matter how many tasks were assigned. Very soon he gave up this idea and stopped giving me anything. I basically created an image of a very skilled engineer who didn’t write code. No matter how much you asked.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Guilt is a very powerful management instrument.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meetings&lt;/strong&gt;. At the beginning he was calling me to all possible meetings, because he thought that I was very smart. I was even smarter than he thought: in each meeting I expressed my opinions in a very aggressive and conflict-provoking way. And I always had enough opinions to express. Very soon he stopped calling me to those hours-long meetings because I was simply ruining them, making strong points, and never “being nice.” Then, when he stopped calling, I pretended to be offended, as if I really wanted to contribute and yet they were all ignoring me. Guilt is a very powerful management instrument, you know.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reports&lt;/strong&gt;. From time to time he was interested to know what was going on, mostly by email or in Slack chat. I always had a very long list of things I was “working on,” which were absolutely cryptic to him. He was not a programmer and didn’t have enough courage to verify my claims. Any time he asked what I was busy with, I sent him something like “HDFS reconfig for Docker image” or “Integration tests for JAX-RS endpoints.” He was happy to see that I was very busy and he left me alone for another week or two. Actually, I would recommend you send such reports to your managers pro-actively, before they even ask. This will make them feel even more comfortable.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Morning Stand-ups&lt;/strong&gt;. These are annoying and very dangerous, because other programmers may catch your lies about “HDFS and Docker.” The best defense is offense: I always acted very interested in what other people were working on. I always asked additional questions too, making them afraid of me. It worked. They never bothered me with their suspicions. Try not to avoid the stand-up meetings—if a manager sees you there they assume that you’re actually working.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advice&lt;/strong&gt;. He would ask me for technical advice, to help him make his decisions. This is rather risky, because eventually you have to be responsible for the advice you give, especially if you are a lead developer or an architect. The best way to avoid this risk is to transfer responsibility to someone else. I was always trying to ask somebody in the team to help me: to analyze the problem and create a short email/report with pros and cons. Junior programmers are usually very interested in doing such a favor for someone more senior. Then, I just forwarded that email to the manager. Very soon he stopped coming to me for the analysis and asked the junior guys directly.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Emails&lt;/strong&gt;. Long email threads are very annoying especially in big teams. I never read them. You should not read them either, if you value your time. However, you can’t just ignore them because everybody will feel that you are either lazy or a sociopath. Neither of which is in your favor. What I always did was pick up on any message from the thread and reply to it, with a question. It’s called &lt;em&gt;trolling&lt;/em&gt;. You provoke others to keep the conversation going, even though you’re not interested in it at all. A few emails like that a day and people will think that you’re on top of everything in the team.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Coaching&lt;/strong&gt;. My manager would ask me every now and then to train new programmers and to help them out. This too was very risky, since the new guys usually decided that I was their friend and would talk to me about everything, consuming my time. To prevent this from happening I would always try to introduce them to somebody else—their new friend. Everybody, if they don’t understand the consequences, is happy to talk to junior programmers and to patronize them. I just had to forward those juniors immediately to the right person.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Personal meetings&lt;/strong&gt;. This was the most annoying part of all: face-to-face meetings with the manager. He asked me how happy I was in the team, what my plans were, what problems I saw, etc. I was not able to say “Well, I’m happy that you guys are still paying me and my biggest problem is that you annoy me far too often.” Instead I had to invent plans, ideas, problems, and things that I wasn’t happy about. I always kept a list of such things ready, in case a manager ever called me for a meeting.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That was my strategy.

Most of them are manageable.</p><figure class="jb_picture"><img itemprop="image" alt="The Intouchables (2011) by Olivier Nakache" src="/images/2017/07/intouchables.jpg" longdesc="#ae07a826" /><figcaption id="ae07a826">The Intouchables (2011) by Olivier Nakache</figcaption></figure><p>First of all, remember your goal: do <em>nothing</em> and <em>get paid</em>.

I basically created an image of a very skilled engineer who didn’t write code. No matter how much you asked.</p><aside class="quote">Guilt is a very powerful management instrument.</aside><p><strong>Meetings</strong>. At the beginning he was calling me to all possible meetings, because he thought that I was very smart. I was even smarter than he thought: in each meeting I expressed my opinions in a very aggressive and conflict-provoking way. And I always had enough opinions to express. Very soon he stopped calling me to those hours-long meetings because I was simply ruining them, making strong points, and never “being nice.” Then, when he stopped calling, I pretended to be offended, as if I really wanted to contribute and yet they were all ignoring me. Guilt is a very powerful management instrument, you know.</p><p><strong>Reports</strong>. From time to time he was interested to know what was going on, mostly by email or in Slack chat. I always had a very long list of things I was “working on,” which were absolutely cryptic to him. He was not a programmer and didn’t have enough courage to verify my claims. Any time he asked what I was busy with, I sent him something like “HDFS reconfig for Docker image” or “Integration tests for JAX-RS endpoints.” He was happy to see that I was very busy and he left me alone for another week or two. Actually, I would recommend you send such reports to your managers pro-actively, before they even ask. This will make them feel even more comfortable.</p><p><strong>Morning Stand-ups</strong>. These are annoying and very dangerous, because other programmers may catch your lies about “HDFS and Docker.” The best defense is offense: I always acted very interested in what other people were working on. I always asked additional questions too, making them afraid of me. It worked. They never bothered me with their suspicions. Try not to avoid the stand-up meetings—if a manager sees you there they assume that you’re actually working.</p><p><strong>Advice</strong>. He would ask me for technical advice, to help him make his decisions. This is rather risky, because eventually you have to be responsible for the advice you give, especially if you are a lead developer or an architect. The best way to avoid this risk is to transfer responsibility to someone else. I was always trying to ask somebody in the team to help me: to analyze the problem and create a short email/report with pros and cons. Junior programmers are usually very interested in doing such a favor for someone more senior. Then, I just forwarded that email to the manager. Very soon he stopped coming to me for the analysis and asked the junior guys directly.</p><p><strong>Emails</strong>. Long email threads are very annoying especially in big teams. I never read them. You should not read them either, if you value your time. However, you can’t just ignore them because everybody will feel that you are either lazy or a sociopath. Neither of which is in your favor. What I always did was pick up on any message from the thread and reply to it, with a question. It’s called <em>trolling</em>. You provoke others to keep the conversation going, even though you’re not interested in it at all. A few emails like that a day and people will think that you’re on top of everything in the team.</p><p><strong>Coaching</strong>. My manager would ask me every now and then to train new programmers and to help them out. This too was very risky, since the new guys usually decided that I was their friend and would talk to me about everything, consuming my time. To prevent this from happening I would always try to introduce them to somebody else—their new friend. Everybody, if they don’t understand the consequences, is happy to talk to junior programmers and to patronize them. I just had to forward those juniors immediately to the right person.</p><p><strong>Personal meetings</strong>. This was the most annoying part of all: face-to-face meetings with the manager. He asked me how happy I was in the team, what my plans were, what problems I saw, etc. I was not able to say “Well, I’m happy that you guys are still paying me and my biggest problem is that you annoy me far too often.” Instead I had to invent plans, ideas, problems, and things that I wasn’t happy about. I always kept a list of such things ready, in case a manager ever called me for a meeting.</p><p>That was my strategy.

Traditional &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/05/24/who-is-project-manager.html&quot;&gt;project management&lt;/a&gt; with its critical path method, contingency reserves, cause-and-effect diagrams, work breakdown structures, policies, procedures, and plans, is dead. &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/07/11/mistakes-in-agile-manifesto.html&quot;&gt;Agile&lt;/a&gt;, Scrum, Kanban, and others, are dancing on its grave, with motivational speeches, burndown rates, sprints, &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/01/08/morning-standup-meetings.html&quot;&gt;standups&lt;/a&gt;, and smoothies. The world doesn’t need managers anymore, it needs leaders. And you must be one. PMBOK and RUP on your bookshelf must be replaced with Elon Musk and Peter Thiel biographies.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be a Committer&lt;/strong&gt;. Not a &lt;a href=&quot;https://git-scm.com/&quot;&gt;Git&lt;/a&gt; committer, obviously—that’s for junior programmers. You have to commit yourself to the project, just like Tim Cook &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2016/12/19/apples-tim-cook-assures-employees-that-it-is-committed-to-the-mac-and-that-great-desktops-are-coming/&quot;&gt;committed&lt;/a&gt; to MacBooks. Technically, this means: staying in the office till late, taking no vacations, wearing a branded t-shirt, never discussing a salary or any money at all, and being a proud patriot, no matter how ugly the product is. In other words, being a &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/10/06/how-to-be-good-office-slave.html&quot;&gt;good slave&lt;/a&gt; and showing your team a good example. Don’t worry about the future, when projects fail good committers just commit &lt;del&gt;suicide&lt;/del&gt; themselves to new projects.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be a Friend&lt;/strong&gt;. Explicit and non-ambiguous work orders are not popular any more—they create tension and destroy &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/03/02/team-morale-myths-and-reality.html&quot;&gt;team morale&lt;/a&gt;. Guilt-driven management is much more subtle and elegant: you turn your subordinates into a family and then say: “I count on you as a friend.” Who can refuse a friend? And not even a friend, but a mom. This is who they will associate you with when the guilt kicks in—with their mothers. They won’t disobey, won’t quit, and will never ask for &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/12/06/how-to-pay-programmers-less.html&quot;&gt;more money&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Don't worry about the future, when projects fail good committers just commit themselves to new projects.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be Responsible&lt;/strong&gt;. In the brick-and-mortar management era responsibility was &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/09/24/why-monetary-awards-dont-work.html&quot;&gt;measurable&lt;/a&gt; by what you earn if you succeed and how you suffer if you fail. Luckily, the world has recently learned that this was a mistake we’d been making for &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/09/27/command-control-innovate.html&quot;&gt;a hundreds years&lt;/a&gt;. We don’t suffer any more. Being responsible now means something completely different. We wear stickers on our MacBooks, we fall in love with “extremely talented people,” we participate, engage, celebrate, and champion excellence. And, of course, now it is &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/11/21/ringelmann-effect-vs-agile.html&quot;&gt;always&lt;/a&gt; “We” instead of “I”: “We are responsible,” “It is our project,” “We can,” “Our goal is to do it together!” Of course, when the project fails you find a new one, with a &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/07/21/hourly-pay-modern-slavery.html&quot;&gt;bigger salary&lt;/a&gt; and a new group of extremely talented people, and become very responsible again.

Not a &lt;a href=&quot;https://git-scm.com/&quot;&gt;Git&lt;/a&gt; committer, obviously—that’s for junior programmers. You have to commit yourself to the project, just like Tim Cook &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2016/12/19/apples-tim-cook-assures-employees-that-it-is-committed-to-the-mac-and-that-great-desktops-are-coming/&quot;&gt;committed&lt;/a&gt; to MacBooks.

They won’t disobey, won’t quit, and will never ask for &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/12/06/how-to-pay-programmers-less.html&quot;&gt;more money&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Don't worry about the future, when projects fail good committers just commit themselves to new projects.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be Responsible&lt;/strong&gt;.

Luckily, the world has recently learned that this was a mistake we’d been making for &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/09/27/command-control-innovate.html&quot;&gt;a hundreds years&lt;/a&gt;. We don’t suffer any more. Being responsible now means something completely different. We wear stickers on our MacBooks, we fall in love with “extremely talented people,” we participate, engage, celebrate, and champion excellence. And, of course, now it is &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/11/21/ringelmann-effect-vs-agile.html&quot;&gt;always&lt;/a&gt; “We” instead of “I”: “We are responsible,” “It is our project,” “We can,” “Our goal is to do it together!” Of course, when the project fails you find a new one, with a &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/07/21/hourly-pay-modern-slavery.html&quot;&gt;bigger salary&lt;/a&gt; and a new group of extremely talented people, and become very responsible again.

And, of course, now it is <a href="/2015/11/21/ringelmann-effect-vs-agile.html">always</a> “We” instead of “I”: “We are responsible,” “It is our project,” “We can,” “Our goal is to do it together!” Of course, when the project fails you find a new one, with a <a href="/2015/07/21/hourly-pay-modern-slavery.html">bigger salary</a> and a new group of extremely talented people, and become very responsible again.

You must remember that keeping people happy is more important than their results, effectiveness and productivity. As an organic manager you must never offend your team with any negativity, finger-pointing, or <a href="/2015/01/05/how-to-be-honest-and-keep-customer.html">honesty</a>. You must think positively and always find a balance somewhere between “you guys are good” and “you’re just fantastic.” You must be their full-hearted <del>clown</del> cheerleader! Truth hurts and modern management is not about hurting people, it’s about making them happy. You must be a permanent source of good news, funny stories, and smiles, shielding your <del>slaves</del> people from the reality and its threats.</p><aside class="quote">Truth hurts and modern management is not about hurting people, it's about making them happy.</aside><p><strong>Be Politically Correct</strong>. How many <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/why-people-are-using-the-term-latinx_us_57753328e4b0cc0fa136a159">latinx</a> are in your team? What about gays and transsexuals? You’re not sure? That’s wrong. You have to count. You don’t know how to segregate bi-sexuals from “normal” people and black females from white males? Well, do the research, there must be some “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mischling_Test">mischling tests</a>” you could do. You have to learn how to count and pay attention to the numbers. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/28/uber-first-diversity-report/">Uber</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/01/krablr-releases-first-diversity-report/">others</a> already do. Diversity, equality, and tolerance: these metrics are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKcWu0tsiZM">quickly replacing</a> outdated performance and productivity appraisals.</p><p><strong>Be Reward-Focused</strong>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leon_Trotsky">Trotsky</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Revolution_Betrayed">said</a> in 1937 that people would eventually work not out of greed or poverty, but because they just enjoy it. He would be happy to see that his prophesy finally <a href="https://techbeacon.com/13-ways-motivate-software-engineers">came true</a>: programmers don’t work for money any more. They <a href="https://www.verywell.com/what-is-intrinsic-motivation-2795385">work</a> for challenge, respect, curiosity, recognition, cooperation, and free beer on Fridays. As a modern eco-manager you must stop humiliating them with old-fashioned <a href="/2014/09/24/why-monetary-awards-dont-work.html">dollar bills</a> and start inspiring them with these <a href="/2015/03/02/team-morale-myths-and-reality.html">intrinsic rewards</a> and free cookies. You will <a href="/2016/12/06/how-to-pay-programmers-less.html">save some money</a> too.</p><p><strong>Be Equal</strong>. <a href="/2016/02/18/holacracy-autocracy.html">Holacracy</a> is quickly replacing military-style management hierarchies, which proved to be depressing and hurtful to human feelings. Modern managers don’t even like to be called “managers.” Instead, they <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/joshlinkner/2014/12/04/the-21-most-creative-job-titles/#2b863a112933">demand</a> we call them ambassadors, curators, cheerleaders, and catalysts. You must be very creative in hiding your actual career ladder position, in order not to irritate and hurt your team. Of course, you will still use fear and guilt to keep your <a href="/2015/10/06/how-to-be-good-office-slave.html">slaves</a> under control, but new eco-titles will help you keep them less aware of what’s going on.</p><aside class="quote">You still use fear and guilt to keep your slaves under control, but new eco-titles help you keep them less aware of what's going on.</aside><p><strong>Be a Leader</strong>. Traditional <a href="/2016/05/24/who-is-project-manager.html">project management</a> with its critical path method, contingency reserves, cause-and-effect diagrams, work breakdown structures, policies, procedures, and plans, is dead. <a href="/2016/07/11/mistakes-in-agile-manifesto.html">Agile</a>, Scrum, Kanban, and others, are dancing on its grave, with motivational speeches, burndown rates, sprints, <a href="/2015/01/08/morning-standup-meetings.html">standups</a>, and smoothies. The world doesn’t need managers anymore, it needs leaders. And you must be one. PMBOK and RUP on your bookshelf must be replaced with Elon Musk and Peter Thiel biographies.</p><p><strong>Be a Committer</strong>. Not a <a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a> committer, obviously—that’s for junior programmers. You have to commit yourself to the project, just like Tim Cook <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/12/19/apples-tim-cook-assures-employees-that-it-is-committed-to-the-mac-and-that-great-desktops-are-coming/">committed</a> to MacBooks. Technically, this means: staying in the office till late, taking no vacations, wearing a branded t-shirt, never discussing a salary or any money at all, and being a proud patriot, no matter how ugly the product is. In other words, being a <a href="/2015/10/06/how-to-be-good-office-slave.html">good slave</a> and showing your team a good example. Don’t worry about the future, when projects fail good committers just commit <del>suicide</del> themselves to new projects.</p><p><strong>Be a Friend</strong>. Explicit and non-ambiguous work orders are not popular any more—they create tension and destroy <a href="/2015/03/02/team-morale-myths-and-reality.html">team morale</a>. Guilt-driven management is much more subtle and elegant: you turn your subordinates into a family and then say: “I count on you as a friend.” Who can refuse a friend? And not even a friend, but a mom. This is who they will associate you with when the guilt kicks in—with their mothers. They won’t disobey, won’t quit, and will never ask for <a href="/2016/12/06/how-to-pay-programmers-less.html">more money</a>.</p><aside class="quote">Don't worry about the future, when projects fail good committers just commit themselves to new projects.</aside><p><strong>Be Responsible</strong>. In the brick-and-mortar management era responsibility was <a href="/2014/09/24/why-monetary-awards-dont-work.html">measurable</a> by what you earn if you succeed and how you suffer if you fail. Luckily, the world has recently learned that this was a mistake we’d been making for <a href="/2016/09/27/command-control-innovate.html">a hundreds years</a>. We don’t suffer any more. Being responsible now means something completely different. We wear stickers on our MacBooks, we fall in love with “extremely talented people,” we participate, engage, celebrate, and champion excellence.

The main principle is similar to the one we use for traditional meetings: Make it fun. Otherwise we will switch to Facebook or PokerStars while the manager is still &lt;del&gt;acting&lt;/del&gt; talking in her window.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Third, we replace Post-it stickies and Scrum boards with tickets and tasks in &lt;a href=&quot;https://trello.com/&quot;&gt;Trello&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-best-alternatives-to-Trello&quot;&gt;any other&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;task tracker&lt;/strong&gt;. We keep everybody busy learning new tools and filling them with data.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Fourth, and most importantly, we replace office chit-chats with &lt;a href=&quot;https://slack.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Slack&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; channels or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hipchat.com/&quot;&gt;HipChat&lt;/a&gt; groups. Instead of being in the office at 9 a.m., everybody will have the ability to demonstrate the level of their &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presenteeism&quot;&gt;presenteeism&lt;/a&gt; using emojis.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Your life, as a developer, will be very different on a team that works remotely. It will be full of real freedom. However, there will be certain problems:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s Harder to Prove Innocence&lt;/strong&gt;. How does your &lt;a href=&quot;/2017/06/06/gluten-free-management.html&quot;&gt;manager&lt;/a&gt; know you’re actually working, not watching TV, playing with your kids, or grooming your favorite open source pets? In the office, it’s easier; you just sit in front of the monitor and the boss is happy. At home or in a coffee shop, you are guilty by default until you prove the opposite by creating new tickets, posting emojis to Slack, and sending emails with multiple CCs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s Harder to Find Information&lt;/strong&gt;. In the office, you can always ask your question out loud for the most knowledgeable person to help you. Remotely, however, you will have to search Wiki pages, Google Docs, and, god forbid, Git logs. Be prepared for almost nobody to be interested in sharing knowledge or teaching you remotely—what is the point if nobody sees him doing it? You will be on your own in front of that year-old documentation made by someone fired right after writing it up.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s Harder to Avoid Overtime&lt;/strong&gt;. In the office, you just walk away with everybody else when time is up. Remotely, you will have phone calls and Slack discussions in the middle of the night on Sunday, especially if the team is distributed across multiple time zones. Everybody will expect 24-7 availability because you’re working from home. And changing the status to “Do not disturb” in Skype will only offend them and seriously damage your reputation. In a work-from-home environment, good programmers are those who are always online.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s Harder to Defend Yourself&lt;/strong&gt;. You won’t know where to expect the next bout of trouble from. In the office, you can visually observe the territory, smell conflict in the air, see how people move, what they talk about, and who is the next victim. Remotely, you’re sitting in isolation, extracting pieces of information from Slack. You can easily become the next victim without even noticing it. Simply put, they will stab you in the back while you’re writing Java and thinking about a new unit test.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s Harder Not to Waste Time&lt;/strong&gt;. It sounds counter-intuitive, but while sitting at home, you waste much more time than in the office. Meetings will be called more frequently, and they will be less effective, thanks to constant issues with scheduling, quality of connection, software failure, and of course a lack of online communication skills. The manager will call more meetings largely in order to convince himself that the team is actually working; hearing your voice many times a day is a perfect confirmation that you are busy and he is a good manager.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Remote work will happen automatically as soon as everybody starts getting their paychecks for the results they deliver, not the time they spend.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;On a more serious note, I believe that working remotely only makes things &lt;em&gt;worse&lt;/em&gt; when the motivation of the team is still based on &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/07/21/hourly-pay-modern-slavery.html&quot;&gt;hourly pay&lt;/a&gt;. A slave working remotely is still a slave. Moreover, this slave is harder to manage and control. First, we have to switch to a results-based payment model and then go remote. Actually, remote work will happen automatically as soon as everybody starts getting their paychecks for the results they deliver, not the time they spend. They will simply stop showing up at the office, but their results will keep coming to the project, without any web cameras or Slack channels.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s no surprise that many big companies have already decided to stop this telecommuting nonsense and put their slaves back behind closed doors; take &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2014/02/19/Leaving-Google&quot;&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://money.cnn.com/2013/02/25/technology/yahoo-work-from-home/index.html?iid=EL&quot;&gt;Yahoo&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://money.cnn.com/2013/03/05/technology/best-buy-work-from-home/index.html&quot;&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; for example.&lt;/p&gt; " /> <meta name="keywords" content="next, path, output, content, previous, url, relative_path, id, collection, excerpt, draft, categories, layout, title, date, place, tags, description, keywords, image, jb_picture, slug, ext" /> <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1"/> <meta name="google-site-verification" content="JEj_gQr2CPe2QKGw8XdMz0R7VboQIUbX3FlM-lwTq-8" /> <meta name="author" content="Yegor Bugayenko"> <meta name="article:published_time" content="2017-05-02 00:00:00 +0000"> <meta name="og:site_name" content="Yegor Bugayenko"/> <meta name="og:type" content="article" /> <meta name="og:locale" content="en_US" /> <meta name="twitter:account_id" content="4503599630178231" /> <meta name="twitter:creator" content="@yegor256"/> <meta name="twitter:site" content="@yegor256"/> <meta name="twitter:title" property="og:title" content="A Remote Slave Is Still a Slave"/> <meta name="twitter:description" property="og:description" content="&lt;p&gt;Working remotely is definitely a trend, according to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bls.gov/opub/ted/2016/24-percent-of-employed-people-did-some-or-all-of-their-work-at-home-in-2015.htm&quot;&gt;BLS&lt;/a&gt; and my personal observations. “Let them work from home” seems to be the silver bullet for every second startup and even some big companies like &lt;a href=&quot;https://open.bufferapp.com/remote-team-connect/&quot;&gt;Buffer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/billion-dollar-tech-company-offices-email-glenn-leibowitz&quot;&gt;Automattic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.groovehq.com/blog/remote-work-tips&quot;&gt;Groove&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/laurashin/2017/01/31/work-from-home-in-2017-the-top-100-companies-offering-remote-jobs/&quot;&gt;many others&lt;/a&gt;.

Otherwise we will switch to Facebook or PokerStars while the manager is still &lt;del&gt;acting&lt;/del&gt; talking in her window.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Third, we replace Post-it stickies and Scrum boards with tickets and tasks in &lt;a href=&quot;https://trello.com/&quot;&gt;Trello&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-best-alternatives-to-Trello&quot;&gt;any other&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;task tracker&lt;/strong&gt;. We keep everybody busy learning new tools and filling them with data.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Fourth, and most importantly, we replace office chit-chats with &lt;a href=&quot;https://slack.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Slack&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; channels or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hipchat.com/&quot;&gt;HipChat&lt;/a&gt; groups. Instead of being in the office at 9 a.m., everybody will have the ability to demonstrate the level of their &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presenteeism&quot;&gt;presenteeism&lt;/a&gt; using emojis.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Your life, as a developer, will be very different on a team that works remotely. It will be full of real freedom. However, there will be certain problems:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s Harder to Prove Innocence&lt;/strong&gt;. How does your &lt;a href=&quot;/2017/06/06/gluten-free-management.html&quot;&gt;manager&lt;/a&gt; know you’re actually working, not watching TV, playing with your kids, or grooming your favorite open source pets? In the office, it’s easier; you just sit in front of the monitor and the boss is happy. At home or in a coffee shop, you are guilty by default until you prove the opposite by creating new tickets, posting emojis to Slack, and sending emails with multiple CCs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s Harder to Find Information&lt;/strong&gt;. In the office, you can always ask your question out loud for the most knowledgeable person to help you. Remotely, however, you will have to search Wiki pages, Google Docs, and, god forbid, Git logs. Be prepared for almost nobody to be interested in sharing knowledge or teaching you remotely—what is the point if nobody sees him doing it? You will be on your own in front of that year-old documentation made by someone fired right after writing it up.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s Harder to Avoid Overtime&lt;/strong&gt;. In the office, you just walk away with everybody else when time is up. Remotely, you will have phone calls and Slack discussions in the middle of the night on Sunday, especially if the team is distributed across multiple time zones. Everybody will expect 24-7 availability because you’re working from home. And changing the status to “Do not disturb” in Skype will only offend them and seriously damage your reputation. In a work-from-home environment, good programmers are those who are always online.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s Harder to Defend Yourself&lt;/strong&gt;. You won’t know where to expect the next bout of trouble from. In the office, you can visually observe the territory, smell conflict in the air, see how people move, what they talk about, and who is the next victim. Remotely, you’re sitting in isolation, extracting pieces of information from Slack. You can easily become the next victim without even noticing it. Simply put, they will stab you in the back while you’re writing Java and thinking about a new unit test.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s Harder Not to Waste Time&lt;/strong&gt;. It sounds counter-intuitive, but while sitting at home, you waste much more time than in the office. Meetings will be called more frequently, and they will be less effective, thanks to constant issues with scheduling, quality of connection, software failure, and of course a lack of online communication skills. The manager will call more meetings largely in order to convince himself that the team is actually working; hearing your voice many times a day is a perfect confirmation that you are busy and he is a good manager.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Remote work will happen automatically as soon as everybody starts getting their paychecks for the results they deliver, not the time they spend.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;On a more serious note, I believe that working remotely only makes things &lt;em&gt;worse&lt;/em&gt; when the motivation of the team is still based on &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/07/21/hourly-pay-modern-slavery.html&quot;&gt;hourly pay&lt;/a&gt;. A slave working remotely is still a slave. Moreover, this slave is harder to manage and control. First, we have to switch to a results-based payment model and then go remote. Actually, remote work will happen automatically as soon as everybody starts getting their paychecks for the results they deliver, not the time they spend. They will simply stop showing up at the office, but their results will keep coming to the project, without any web cameras or Slack channels.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s no surprise that many big companies have already decided to stop this telecommuting nonsense and put their slaves back behind closed doors; take &lt;a

The main principle is similar to the one we use for traditional meetings: Make it fun. Otherwise we will switch to Facebook or PokerStars while the manager is still <del>acting</del> talking in her window.</p></li> <li><p>Third, we replace Post-it stickies and Scrum boards with tickets and tasks in <a href="https://trello.com/">Trello</a> or <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-best-alternatives-to-Trello">any other</a> <strong>task tracker</strong>. We keep everybody busy learning new tools and filling them with data.</p></li> <li><p>Fourth, and most importantly, we replace office chit-chats with <a href="https://slack.com/"><strong>Slack</strong></a> channels or <a href="https://www.hipchat.com/">HipChat</a> groups. Instead of being in the office at 9 a.m., everybody will have the ability to demonstrate the level of their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presenteeism">presenteeism</a> using emojis.</p></li></ul><p>Your life, as a developer, will be very different on a team that works remotely. It will be full of real freedom. However, there will be certain problems:</p><p><strong>It’s Harder to Prove Innocence</strong>. How does your <a href="/2017/06/06/gluten-free-management.html">manager</a> know you’re actually working, not watching TV, playing with your kids, or grooming your favorite open source pets? In the office, it’s easier; you just sit in front of the monitor and the boss is happy. At home or in a coffee shop, you are guilty by default until you prove the opposite by creating new tickets, posting emojis to Slack, and sending emails with multiple CCs.</p><p><strong>It’s Harder to Find Information</strong>. In the office, you can always ask your question out loud for the most knowledgeable person to help you. Remotely, however, you will have to search Wiki pages, Google Docs, and, god forbid, Git logs. Be prepared for almost nobody to be interested in sharing knowledge or teaching you remotely—what is the point if nobody sees him doing it? You will be on your own in front of that year-old documentation made by someone fired right after writing it up.</p><p><strong>It’s Harder to Avoid Overtime</strong>. In the office, you just walk away with everybody else when time is up. Remotely, you will have phone calls and Slack discussions in the middle of the night on Sunday, especially if the team is distributed across multiple time zones. Everybody will expect 24-7 availability because you’re working from home. And changing the status to “Do not disturb” in Skype will only offend them and seriously damage your reputation. In a work-from-home environment, good programmers are those who are always online.</p><p><strong>It’s Harder to Defend Yourself</strong>. You won’t know where to expect the next bout of trouble from. In the office, you can visually observe the territory, smell conflict in the air, see how people move, what they talk about, and who is the next victim. Remotely, you’re sitting in isolation, extracting pieces of information from Slack. You can easily become the next victim without even noticing it. Simply put, they will stab you in the back while you’re writing Java and thinking about a new unit test.</p><p><strong>It’s Harder Not to Waste Time</strong>. It sounds counter-intuitive, but while sitting at home, you waste much more time than in the office. Meetings will be called more frequently, and they will be less effective, thanks to constant issues with scheduling, quality of connection, software failure, and of course a lack of online communication skills. The manager will call more meetings largely in order to convince himself that the team is actually working; hearing your voice many times a day is a perfect confirmation that you are busy and he is a good manager.</p><aside class="quote">Remote work will happen automatically as soon as everybody starts getting their paychecks for the results they deliver, not the time they spend.</aside><p>On a more serious note, I believe that working remotely only makes things <em>worse</em> when the motivation of the team is still based on <a href="/2015/07/21/hourly-pay-modern-slavery.html">hourly pay</a>. A slave working remotely is still a slave. Moreover, this slave is harder to manage and control. First, we have to switch to a results-based payment model and then go remote. Actually, remote work will happen automatically as soon as everybody starts getting their paychecks for the results they deliver, not the time they spend.

There are many examples of the “just works” mentality.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Take Perl, a programming language famous for its ability to do anything in three different ways. This means that there is no one “right” way. I’m not a Perl expert; that’s why I’ll have you look at this Ruby code instead:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot; data-lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;b&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;m&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;Hello!&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;We can rewrite it like this:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot; data-lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;m&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;b&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;Hello!&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Or this:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot; data-lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;m&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;Hello!&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;And one more:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot; data-lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;m&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;b&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;Hello&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kp&quot;&gt;nil&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Which one is “right?” Are there any Perl developers? Can you suggest some other way to achieve the same result?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Not surprisingly, in Java (a stricter language than Ruby), there is only one way to do it:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot; data-lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;m&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Hello!&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Well, I guess I’m wrong; there are two, actually. Here is the second one:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot; data-lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;m&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Hello!&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;What does this variety of options give us, as programmers? I guess the answer seriously depends on what we, the programmers, are doing with the code: writing or reading it. Also, it depends on our &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/10/26/hacker-vs-programmer-mentality.html&quot;&gt;attitude&lt;/a&gt; toward the software we’re creating; we either &lt;em&gt;own&lt;/em&gt; it (hacker mentality) or &lt;em&gt;build&lt;/em&gt; it (designer mentality).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If we’re &lt;em&gt;writing&lt;/em&gt; it, and we love to think about ourselves as code owners, we definitely will need that arsenal of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntactic_sugar&quot;&gt;syntactic sugar&lt;/a&gt; weapons. We need them to prove to ourselves that we’re smart and, of course, to show off in front of our friends and that soulless Ruby interpreter.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On the other hand, if we’re designers and happen to &lt;em&gt;read&lt;/em&gt; the code that is full of sugar, which “just works,” we’ll be very annoyed and frustrated. Well, maybe I have to speak for myself, but I definitely will be.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Simply put, higher quality comes from simpler languages.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;This overly-sugared Ruby syntax is a perfect example of “works vs. good” positioning. Ruby philosophy is this: It doesn’t matter how you write it, as long as it works. Java philosophy is different; it’s much closer to: Make it right and it will work. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_and_weak_typing&quot;&gt;weak&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_system#Dynamic_type_checking_and_runtime_type_information&quot;&gt;dynamic&lt;/a&gt; typing in Ruby vs. the strong and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_system#Static_type_checking&quot;&gt;static&lt;/a&gt; one in Java also prove my point.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In general, I believe that the more flexible the programming language is, the lower the &lt;em&gt;maintainability&lt;/em&gt;—the key quality characteristic—of the code it produces. Simply put, higher quality comes from simpler languages.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The same is true for the entire software development: The more restrictions we put on programmers and the fewer options they have for their “syntax creativity,” the higher the quality of the software they write. Static analyzers like &lt;a href=&quot;http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net/&quot;&gt;Checkstyle&lt;/a&gt; for Java or &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop&quot;&gt;Rubocop&lt;/a&gt; for Ruby attempt to solve that problem and prohibit us from using certain language features, but they lag far behind. We are very “creative.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now, let’s get back to the original OOP question: Why do we need to improve anything if it works the way it is? Here is the answer: Modern OOP (as in Java, Ruby, and C++) doesn’t produce quality code because it doesn’t have a strong and properly restricted paradigm. It just has too many “features,” which were mostly introduced by C++ and remained there for our mutual “convenience.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They indeed work, but the maintainability of the software we produce is very low. Well, it’s way lower than it could be, if our “creativity” would be restricted.&lt;/p&gt; " /> <meta name="keywords" content="next, path, output, content, previous, url, relative_path, id, collection, excerpt, draft, categories, layout, title, date, place, tags, description, keywords, image, jb_picture, slug, ext" /> <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1"/> <meta name="google-site-verification" content="JEj_gQr2CPe2QKGw8XdMz0R7VboQIUbX3FlM-lwTq-8" /> <meta name="author" content="Yegor Bugayenko"> <meta name="article:published_time" content="2017-04-11 00:00:00 +0000"> <meta name="og:site_name" content="Yegor Bugayenko"/> <meta name="og:type" content="article" /> <meta name="og:locale" content="en_US" /> <meta name="twitter:account_id" content="4503599630178231" /> <meta name="twitter:creator" content="@yegor256"/> <meta name="twitter:site" content="@yegor256"/> <meta name="twitter:title" property="og:title" content="Flexibility Equates to Lower Quality"/> <meta name="twitter:description" property="og:description" content="&lt;p&gt;There are two opposing mindsets: “If it works, it’s good” vs. “If it’s good, it works;” or “Make it work” vs. “Make it right.” I’m talking about the software source code.

I’m not a Perl expert; that’s why I’ll have you look at this Ruby code instead:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot; data-lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;b&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;m&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;Hello!&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;We can rewrite it like this:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot; data-lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;m&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;b&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;Hello!&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Or this:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot; data-lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;m&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;Hello!&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;And one more:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot; data-lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;m&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;b&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;Hello&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kp&quot;&gt;nil&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Which one is “right?” Are there any Perl developers? Can you suggest some other way to achieve the same result?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Not surprisingly, in Java (a stricter language than Ruby), there is only one way to do it:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot; data-lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;m&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Hello!&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Well, I guess I’m wrong; there are two, actually. Here is the second one:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot; data-lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;m&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Hello!&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;What does this variety of options give us, as programmers? I guess the answer seriously depends on what we, the programmers, are doing with the code: writing or reading it. Also, it depends on our &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/10/26/hacker-vs-programmer-mentality.html&quot;&gt;attitude&lt;/a&gt; toward the software we’re creating; we either &lt;em&gt;own&lt;/em&gt; it (hacker mentality) or &lt;em&gt;build&lt;/em&gt; it (designer mentality).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If we’re &lt;em&gt;writing&lt;/em&gt; it, and we love to think about ourselves as code owners, we definitely will need that arsenal of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntactic_sugar&quot;&gt;syntactic sugar&lt;/a&gt; weapons. We need them to prove to ourselves that we’re smart and, of course, to show off in front of our friends and that soulless Ruby interpreter.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On the other hand, if we’re designers and happen to &lt;em&gt;read&lt;/em&gt; the code that is full of sugar, which “just works,” we’ll be very annoyed and frustrated. Well, maybe I have to speak for myself, but I definitely will be.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Simply put, higher quality comes from simpler languages.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;This overly-sugared Ruby syntax is a perfect example of “works vs. good” positioning. Ruby philosophy is this: It doesn’t matter how you write it, as long as it works. Java philosophy is different; it’s much closer to: Make it right and it will work. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_and_weak_typing&quot;&gt;weak&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_system#Dynamic_type_checking_and_runtime_type_information&quot;&gt;dynamic&lt;/a&gt; typing in Ruby vs. the strong and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_system#Static_type_checking&quot;&gt;static&lt;/a&gt; one in Java also prove my point.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In general, I believe that the more flexible the programming language is, the lower the &lt;em&gt;maintainability&lt;/em&gt;—the key quality characteristic—of the code it produces. Simply put, higher quality comes from simpler languages.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The same is true for the entire software development: The more restrictions we put on programmers and the fewer options they have for their “syntax creativity,” the higher the quality of the software they write. Static analyzers like &lt;a href=&quot;http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net/&quot;&gt;Checkstyle&lt;/a&gt; for Java or &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop&quot;&gt;Rubocop&lt;/a&gt; for Ruby attempt to solve that problem and prohibit us from using certain language features, but they lag far behind. We are very “creative.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now, let’s get back to the original OOP question: Why do we need to improve anything if it works the way it is? Here is the answer: Modern OOP (as in Java, Ruby, and C++) doesn’t produce quality code because it doesn’t have a strong and properly restricted paradigm. It just has too many “features,” which were mostly introduced by C++ and remained there for our mutual “convenience.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They indeed work, but the maintainability of the software we produce is very low. Well, it’s way lower than it could be, if our “creativity” would be restricted.&lt;/p&gt; "/> <meta name="twitter:url" property="og:url"

I’ve been hearing this almost every day in blog comments: Why do we need all those <em>new</em> OOP principles if our code works just fine without them? What is the point of introducing a new way, which is supposed to be “better,” if the existing, traditional, semi-object, semi-procedural, not-so-perfect approach <strong>just works</strong>?</p><figure class="jb_picture"><img itemprop="image" alt="Scarface (1983) by Brian De Palma" src="/images/2017/04/scarface.jpg" longdesc="#efc1df03" /><figcaption id="efc1df03">Scarface (1983) by Brian De Palma</figcaption></figure><p>Let’s try to think bigger. And not just about object-oriented programming, but in general about software development. There are many examples of the “just works” mentality.</p><p>Take Perl, a programming language famous for its ability to do anything in three different ways. This means that there is no one “right” way. I’m not a Perl expert; that’s why I’ll have you look at this Ruby code instead:</p><figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span></span><span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">b</span>
  <span class="n">m</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s1">&#39;Hello!&#39;</span>
<span class="k">end</span></code></pre></figure><p>We can rewrite it like this:</p><figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span></span><span class="n">m</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">b</span>
  <span class="s1">&#39;Hello!&#39;</span>
<span class="k">end</span></code></pre></figure><p>Or this:</p><figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span></span><span class="n">m</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s1">&#39;Hello!&#39;</span> <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">b</span></code></pre></figure><p>And one more:</p><figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span></span><span class="n">m</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">b</span> <span class="p">?</span> <span class="s1">&#39;Hello&#39;</span> <span class="p">:</span> <span class="kp">nil</span></code></pre></figure><p>Which one is “right?” Are there any Perl developers? Can you suggest some other way to achieve the same result?</p><p>Not surprisingly, in Java (a stricter language than Ruby), there is only one way to do it:</p><figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span></span><span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">b</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="n">m</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Hello!&quot;</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure><p>Well, I guess I’m wrong; there are two, actually. Here is the second one:</p><figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span></span><span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">b</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="n">m</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Hello!&quot;</span><span class="p">;</span></code></pre></figure><p>What does this variety of options give us, as programmers? I guess the answer seriously depends on what we, the programmers, are doing with the code: writing or reading it. Also, it depends on our <a href="/2014/10/26/hacker-vs-programmer-mentality.html">attitude</a> toward the software we’re creating; we either <em>own</em> it (hacker mentality) or <em>build</em> it (designer mentality).</p><p>If we’re <em>writing</em> it, and we love to think about ourselves as code owners, we definitely will need that arsenal of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntactic_sugar">syntactic sugar</a> weapons. We need them to prove to ourselves that we’re smart and, of course, to show off in front of our friends and that soulless Ruby interpreter.</p><p>On the other hand, if we’re designers and happen to <em>read</em> the code that is full of sugar, which “just works,” we’ll be very annoyed and frustrated. Well, maybe I have to speak for myself, but I definitely will be.</p><aside class="quote">Simply put, higher quality comes from simpler languages.</aside><p>This overly-sugared Ruby syntax is a perfect example of “works vs. good” positioning. Ruby philosophy is this: It doesn’t matter how you write it, as long as it works. Java philosophy is different; it’s much closer to: Make it right and it will work. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_and_weak_typing">weak</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_system#Dynamic_type_checking_and_runtime_type_information">dynamic</a> typing in Ruby vs. the strong and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_system#Static_type_checking">static</a> one in Java also prove my point.</p><p>In general, I believe that the more flexible the programming language is, the lower the <em>maintainability</em>—the key quality characteristic—of the code it produces. Simply put, higher quality comes from simpler languages.</p><p>The same is true for the entire software development: The more restrictions we put on programmers and the fewer options they have for their “syntax creativity,” the higher the quality of the software they write. Static analyzers like <a href="http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net/">Checkstyle</a> for Java or <a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop">Rubocop</a> for Ruby attempt to solve that problem and prohibit us from using certain language features, but they lag far behind. We are very “creative.”</p><p>Now, let’s get back to the original OOP question: Why do we need to improve anything if it works the way it is? Here is the answer: Modern OOP (as in Java, Ruby, and C++) doesn’t produce quality code because it doesn’t have a strong and properly restricted paradigm. It just has too many “features,” which were mostly introduced by C++ and remained there for our mutual “convenience.”</p><p>They indeed work, but the maintainability of the software we produce is very low.

A professional and well-managed team loves conflicts and creates them on a daily basis. A professional project manager provokes conflicts and makes sure none of them end in a consensus. Does that sound strange? It’s not sarcasm. Read on.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;!--more--&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;jb_picture&quot;&gt;&lt;img itemprop=&quot;image&quot; alt=&quot;Being Flynn (2012) by Paul Weitz&quot; src=&quot;/images/2017/01/being-flynn.jpg&quot; longdesc=&quot;#929ab07e&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption id=&quot;929ab07e&quot;&gt;Being Flynn (2012) by Paul Weitz&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Have you ever heard the term “win-win?” Do you know what it means? My guess is that most of my readers aren’t exactly sure what this is about, even though it’s used very often. Let me explain. In any conflict, there are three possible outcomes: lose-lose, win-lose, and win-win. The first one is the worst, and the last one is the best. Here is an example.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Say your wife wants to watch a movie, and you want to watch a baseball game. That’s a conflict. It starts with a confrontation of &lt;em&gt;positions&lt;/em&gt;. Your position is, “I want this game,” while her position is, “I want this movie.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;youtube&quot;&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWLpAZqvqSc&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;box&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GWLpAZqvqSc/mqdefault.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;YouTube video #GWLpAZqvqSc&quot; /&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;play&quot;&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;icon icon-play&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;div&gt;How to Deal With Conflicts in a Software Team (Webinar #21); 8 February 2017.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;The easiest way is to hold to these positions no matter what, but very soon your conflict will turn into a fight and maybe eventually a divorce.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Project management offers a few &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict_resolution&quot;&gt;conflict resolution techniques&lt;/a&gt; that can help you and your wife get out of this confrontation without asking the police for help. No matter which technique you use, the result will be either lose-lose, win-lose, or win-win.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;lose-lose&quot;&gt;Lose-Lose&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compromise&quot;&gt;Compromise&lt;/a&gt; is the worst outcome, and it’s known as lose-lose. For example, you both agree on watching the news—that’s a compromise. Neither of you will get what you wanted, a movie or a baseball game. You both lose. Who gains in this case? You neighbors and the police, since there will be no fight. Will the problem really be solved? No. You both will hate each other even more, because neither of your desires were satisfied. The divorce is still coming closer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;If we resolve conflicts through compromises, everybody suffers except those management monkeys&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;The same happens in software team conflicts—if and when we resolve them through compromises, everybody suffers except those &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/09/29/mayonnaise.html&quot;&gt;management and HR monkeys&lt;/a&gt; who only care about a peaceful &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/10/06/how-to-be-good-office-slave.html&quot;&gt;office&lt;/a&gt; environment. They don’t want to see us fighting over a piece of damn Java code. Moreover, they don’t really understand what the fight is about. They know nothing about that &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/06/27/singletons-must-die.html&quot;&gt;Singleton&lt;/a&gt; design pattern and can’t understand why these guys are almost ready to kill each other just because one of them says it’s a pattern and the other one calls it an &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/02/03/design-patterns-and-anti-patterns.html&quot;&gt;anti-pattern&lt;/a&gt;, insists that the project must not use it, and threatens everybody with an immediate discharge if they don’t listen.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Such a fight freaks everybody out. Everybody who sees positions and doesn’t see &lt;em&gt;interests&lt;/em&gt;, that is. Remember, the position is, “I want to see the movie” and “I want to use a singleton.” The only thing a confrontation of positions can produce is a fight, and the only solution is a compromise: “You guys need a good &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/03/02/team-morale-myths-and-reality.html&quot;&gt;team-building party&lt;/a&gt; so you become friends and lose &lt;del&gt;balls&lt;/del&gt; the desire to fight.” That’s what those monkeys build: teams. They believe that when the team is “strong,” there will be no fights, no conflicts, no arguments, no design patterns, no anti-patterns, and … no senior developers. There will be just one permanent compromise over everything.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In a family, compromises lead to divorces. In a software team, the best talent just leaves. They simply don’t want to see their interests being disrespected all the time, just for the sake of &lt;em&gt;avoiding&lt;/em&gt; fights. Stay away from compromises; they are pure evil for both a family and a team.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;win-lose&quot;&gt;Win-Lose&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The second option, which is a bit better than a compromise, is to use force: “I’m a man, so you do what I say; we will watch the game!” or “I feel sick; let me watch a movie.” In either case, one of you will get what he or she initially wanted. Even though this approach looks less “democratic,” it’s way more effective, mostly because it doesn’t involve any third parties: There is no interest of the police or neighbors involved, and the family resolves the conflict internally and naturally.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Both of you understand exactly why you’re watching that game now: because the male part of the family is physically stronger. Even though it may sound super annoying to you, my Californian readers, such a family would be way farther from a divorce than the one that used to make compromises, especially if the winning party is not always the same.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If your software team has a &lt;del&gt;moronic&lt;/del&gt; experienced &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/10/12/who-is-software-architect.html&quot;&gt;architect&lt;/a&gt;, you will most likely work in this conflict resolution model. He or she will make decisions, and you will have to go along. I wrote about such an architect &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/07/21/convince-me.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/10/12/who-is-software-architect.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. I said there that an architect must be a dictator, making decisions and taking full responsibility for them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If the architect is super smart, respected by everybody, and immortal, this force-based conflict resolution technique will work perfectly. The project will move forward fast, because everybody will work instead of think. There will be only one person who thinks—the architect.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The main drawback of this win-lose approach is the “lose” part: Someone is always losing. And it’s not about an offense, even though that’s also important. It’s about us missing some valuable information. You will never know why your wife wanted to watch that movie or why that junior developer was suggesting you use NoSQL instead of SQL. You will just force them both to shut up and follow your will. While they did, you still “lost” something. So basically it’s the team that is losing something, not just your wife or that junior developer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;win-win&quot;&gt;Win-Win&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The most difficult and yet most effective way to resolve a conflict is to collaborate in order to discover the interests of all parties and find a solution that satisfies them all. You start by asking, “Why do you want to watch that movie?” to learn what exactly is behind that aggressive “I want the movie” position. Again, there is a huge difference between a position and an interest.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You may hear this back: “I’m just tired.” So the real interest is to &lt;em&gt;relax&lt;/em&gt;, not to watch the movie. The movie was just one of the options to get rest. Now, knowing her real interest, you may come up with, “How about I watch the game and give you a massage at the same time?” This way, the divorce may never happen.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thus, the first important step is to help everybody abandon their &lt;em&gt;positions&lt;/em&gt; and honestly expose their &lt;em&gt;interests&lt;/em&gt;. When that’s done, we can all start to work not against each other but against the problem: With what solution will all our interests be satisfied at the same time?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;A truly professional software team is full of conflicts&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;We will ask that junior developer: “Why do you think we need NoSQL?” It’s very likely that we will hear something like, “I just want to learn this new concept.” This is his real interest—to learn something new while working on this project. Maybe we can offer him some other technology to learn? Maybe we can move him to another project where NoSQL is used? There are many options. But the first step is to understand what he really wants. Not what position he took, but what was his real motivation for it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A truly professional software team is full of conflicts, which are always being resolved by collaboration. The team is not afraid of conflicts. Instead, it &lt;em&gt;welcomes&lt;/em&gt; them, because they help reveal the real interests of all parties involved and make a lot of information visible and available.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Truly professional team players always try to &lt;em&gt;provoke&lt;/em&gt; conflicts in order to gain an opportunity to resolve them through collaboration, thereby exiting through the win-win door. That’s how the team grows—not by hiding conflicts and making compromises, but by provoking them, making different interests visible, and finding the most optimal solutions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Be aware, though, that this is way more difficult than organizing &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/12/06/how-to-pay-programmers-less.html&quot;&gt;team-building parties&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; " /> <meta name="keywords" content="next, path, output, content, previous, url, relative_path, id, collection, excerpt, draft, categories, layout, title, date, place, tags, description, keywords, image, jb_picture, slug, ext" /> <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1"/> <meta name="google-site-verification" content="JEj_gQr2CPe2QKGw8XdMz0R7VboQIUbX3FlM-lwTq-8" /> <meta name="author" content="Yegor Bugayenko"> <meta name="article:published_time" content="2017-01-03 00:00:00 +0000"> <meta name="og:site_name" content="Yegor Bugayenko"/> <meta name="og:type" content="article" /> <meta name="og:locale" content="en_US" /> <meta name="twitter:account_id" content="4503599630178231" /> <meta name="twitter:creator" content="@yegor256"/> <meta name="twitter:site" content="@yegor256"/> <meta name="twitter:title" property="og:title" content="How Much Do You Love Conflict?"/> <meta name="twitter:description" property="og:description" content="&lt;p&gt;Conflict is what progress is made of.

Does that sound strange? It’s not sarcasm. Read on.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;!--more--&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;jb_picture&quot;&gt;&lt;img itemprop=&quot;image&quot; alt=&quot;Being Flynn (2012) by Paul Weitz&quot; src=&quot;/images/2017/01/being-flynn.jpg&quot; longdesc=&quot;#929ab07e&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption id=&quot;929ab07e&quot;&gt;Being Flynn (2012) by Paul Weitz&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Have you ever heard the term “win-win?” Do you know what it means? My guess is that most of my readers aren’t exactly sure what this is about, even though it’s used very often. Let me explain. In any conflict, there are three possible outcomes: lose-lose, win-lose, and win-win. The first one is the worst, and the last one is the best. Here is an example.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Say your wife wants to watch a movie, and you want to watch a baseball game. That’s a conflict. It starts with a confrontation of &lt;em&gt;positions&lt;/em&gt;. Your position is, “I want this game,” while her position is, “I want this movie.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;youtube&quot;&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWLpAZqvqSc&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;box&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GWLpAZqvqSc/mqdefault.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;YouTube video #GWLpAZqvqSc&quot; /&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;play&quot;&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;icon icon-play&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;div&gt;How to Deal With Conflicts in a Software Team (Webinar #21); 8 February 2017.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;The easiest way is to hold to these positions no matter what, but very soon your conflict will turn into a fight and maybe eventually a divorce.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Project management offers a few &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict_resolution&quot;&gt;conflict resolution techniques&lt;/a&gt; that can help you and your wife get out of this confrontation without asking the police for help. No matter which technique you use, the result will be either lose-lose, win-lose, or win-win.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;lose-lose&quot;&gt;Lose-Lose&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compromise&quot;&gt;Compromise&lt;/a&gt; is the worst outcome, and it’s known as lose-lose. For example, you both agree on watching the news—that’s a compromise. Neither of you will get what you wanted, a movie or a baseball game. You both lose. Who gains in this case? You neighbors and the police, since there will be no fight. Will the problem really be solved? No. You both will hate each other even more, because neither of your desires were satisfied. The divorce is still coming closer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;If we resolve conflicts through compromises, everybody suffers except those management monkeys&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;The same happens in software team conflicts—if and when we resolve them through compromises, everybody suffers except those &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/09/29/mayonnaise.html&quot;&gt;management and HR monkeys&lt;/a&gt; who only care about a peaceful &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/10/06/how-to-be-good-office-slave.html&quot;&gt;office&lt;/a&gt; environment. They don’t want to see us fighting over a piece of damn Java code. Moreover, they don’t really understand what the fight is about. They know nothing about that &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/06/27/singletons-must-die.html&quot;&gt;Singleton&lt;/a&gt; design pattern and can’t understand why these guys are almost ready to kill each other just because one of them says it’s a pattern and the other one calls it an &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/02/03/design-patterns-and-anti-patterns.html&quot;&gt;anti-pattern&lt;/a&gt;, insists that the project must not use it, and threatens everybody with an immediate discharge if they don’t listen.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Such a fight freaks everybody out. Everybody who sees positions and doesn’t see &lt;em&gt;interests&lt;/em&gt;, that is. Remember, the position is, “I want to see the movie” and “I want to use a singleton.” The only thing a confrontation of positions can produce is a fight, and the only solution is a compromise: “You guys need a good &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/03/02/team-morale-myths-and-reality.html&quot;&gt;team-building party&lt;/a&gt; so you become friends and lose &lt;del&gt;balls&lt;/del&gt; the desire to fight.” That’s what those monkeys build: teams.

Here is an example.</p><p>Say your wife wants to watch a movie, and you want to watch a baseball game. That’s a conflict. It starts with a confrontation of <em>positions</em>. Your position is, “I want this game,” while her position is, “I want this movie.”</p><aside class="youtube"> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWLpAZqvqSc"><div class="box"> <img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GWLpAZqvqSc/mqdefault.jpg" alt="YouTube video #GWLpAZqvqSc" /><div class="play"><i class="icon icon-play"></i></div></div></a><div>How to Deal With Conflicts in a Software Team (Webinar #21); 8 February 2017.</div></aside><p>The easiest way is to hold to these positions no matter what, but very soon your conflict will turn into a fight and maybe eventually a divorce.</p><p>Project management offers a few <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict_resolution">conflict resolution techniques</a> that can help you and your wife get out of this confrontation without asking the police for help.

Everybody who sees positions and doesn’t see <em>interests</em>, that is. Remember, the position is, “I want to see the movie” and “I want to use a singleton.” The only thing a confrontation of positions can produce is a fight, and the only solution is a compromise: “You guys need a good <a href="/2015/03/02/team-morale-myths-and-reality.html">team-building party</a> so you become friends and lose <del>balls</del> the desire to fight.” That’s what those monkeys build: teams. They believe that when the team is “strong,” there will be no fights, no conflicts, no arguments, no design patterns, no anti-patterns, and … no senior developers. There will be just one permanent compromise over everything.</p><p>In a family, compromises lead to divorces. In a software team, the best talent just leaves. They simply don’t want to see their interests being disrespected all the time, just for the sake of <em>avoiding</em> fights.

Even though this approach looks less “democratic,” it’s way more effective, mostly because it doesn’t involve any third parties: There is no interest of the police or neighbors involved, and the family resolves the conflict internally and naturally.</p><p>Both of you understand exactly why you’re watching that game now: because the male part of the family is physically stronger.

And it’s not about an offense, even though that’s also important. It’s about us missing some valuable information. You will never know why your wife wanted to watch that movie or why that junior developer was suggesting you use NoSQL instead of SQL. You will just force them both to shut up and follow your will. While they did, you still “lost” something. So basically it’s the team that is losing something, not just your wife or that junior developer.</p><h2 id="win-win">Win-Win</h2><p>The most difficult and yet most effective way to resolve a conflict is to collaborate in order to discover the interests of all parties and find a solution that satisfies them all.

The movie was just one of the options to get rest. Now, knowing her real interest, you may come up with, “How about I watch the game and give you a massage at the same time?” This way, the divorce may never happen.</p><p>Thus, the first important step is to help everybody abandon their <em>positions</em> and honestly expose their <em>interests</em>.

To work and produce something for someone, we need two things: motivation and punishment. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrot_and_stick&quot;&gt;carrot and stick&lt;/a&gt; has been a dominating principle in management for thousands of years. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colosseum&quot;&gt;The Colosseum&lt;/a&gt; was built not because people enjoyed building it but rather thanks to a simple rule: Good slaves ate, and bad ones were beaten to death. A primitive form of command-and-control management was most effective at that time, both in civil and military arenas.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;The external strength of any army is ensured by its internal discipline.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;Once slavery became illegal in the 19th century, the simple rule changed: Good workers were paid, while bad ones were fired. 150 years ago in most countries, losing a job literally meant starvation and sometimes death, so it was not really far away from beating slaves to death. Because a hundred years ago there were nearly no mechanisms for &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_protection&quot;&gt;social protection&lt;/a&gt;, capitalists were allowed to do almost anything they wanted. A slightly more advanced but still rather primitive form of command and control was the best management paradigm.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Besides that, the armies of all time have always been built as hierarchies with very strict and deterministic definitions of responsibilities and authorities. Since the time of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Tzu&quot;&gt;Sun Tzu&lt;/a&gt;, the external strength of any army was ensured by its internal discipline, which was always about a clear and explicit chain of commands, rewards, and punishments.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;youtube&quot;&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwrMKTFyohg&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;box&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AwrMKTFyohg/mqdefault.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;YouTube video #AwrMKTFyohg&quot; /&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;play&quot;&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;icon icon-play&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;div&gt;#NoMagic; 13 April 2018.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;The situation started to change only recently, in the 20th century. Three trends dramatically influenced the balance of power between employers and employees, masters and slaves, managers and managees: socialism, computers, and education.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;First of all, socialism is slowly taking over capitalism. Workers gradually obtain more rights and protections while employers lose them every year. Losing a job is not a tragedy for us anymore.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Second, the complexity of the tasks we perform at our workplaces is growing, mostly thanks to computers. We are not as easily replaceable as we were a few hundred years ago.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Third, we are getting smarter every year. Most of us know how to read and write. We learn more, faster, partially due to the Internet.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thanks to these three major trends, it’s almost impossible to apply the same primitive command-and-control management anymore: Modern workers are not the same as those who built the Colosseum in ancient Rome. We are very different, and our carrots and sticks must also be very different in order to be effective. Still, giving us carrots and sticks is absolutely necessary, because we are still lazy and greedy, just like the guys who built the Colosseum. Likewise, we need motivation and punishment in order to produce something for someone.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;They still adhere to command and control but mask it as inspire and trust.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;What about creativity and inspiration? Just like the architects of the Colosseum, we need people today to create iPads and Facebooks, but management and coordination are what really make projects happen. And command and control is the only working mechanism for coordinating humans.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, what management is doing now is absolutely evil and unethical. They still adhere to command and control but mask it as inspire and trust. They use carrots and sticks but redefine them as appreciation and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer_pressure&quot;&gt;peer pressure&lt;/a&gt;. They lie to us that we are not animals anymore and don’t need command and control, while at the same time doing &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/01/05/how-to-punish-employees.html&quot;&gt;exactly that&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The primary victim of this slick approach is our mental health.

A slightly more advanced but still rather primitive form of command and control was the best management paradigm.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Besides that, the armies of all time have always been built as hierarchies with very strict and deterministic definitions of responsibilities and authorities. Since the time of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Tzu&quot;&gt;Sun Tzu&lt;/a&gt;, the external strength of any army was ensured by its internal discipline, which was always about a clear and explicit chain of commands, rewards, and punishments.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;youtube&quot;&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwrMKTFyohg&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;box&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AwrMKTFyohg/mqdefault.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;YouTube video #AwrMKTFyohg&quot; /&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;play&quot;&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;icon icon-play&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;div&gt;#NoMagic; 13 April 2018.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;The situation started to change only recently, in the 20th century. Three trends dramatically influenced the balance of power between employers and employees, masters and slaves, managers and managees: socialism, computers, and education.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;First of all, socialism is slowly taking over capitalism. Workers gradually obtain more rights and protections while employers lose them every year. Losing a job is not a tragedy for us anymore.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Second, the complexity of the tasks we perform at our workplaces is growing, mostly thanks to computers. We are not as easily replaceable as we were a few hundred years ago.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Third, we are getting smarter every year. Most of us know how to read and write. We learn more, faster, partially due to the Internet.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thanks to these three major trends, it’s almost impossible to apply the same primitive command-and-control management anymore: Modern workers are not the same as those who built the Colosseum in ancient Rome. We are very different, and our carrots and sticks must also be very different in order to be effective. Still, giving us carrots and sticks is absolutely necessary, because we are still lazy and greedy, just like the guys who built the Colosseum. Likewise, we need motivation and punishment in order to produce something for someone.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;They still adhere to command and control but mask it as inspire and trust.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;What about creativity and inspiration? Just like the architects of the Colosseum, we need people today to create iPads and Facebooks, but management and coordination are what really make projects happen. And command and control is the only working mechanism for coordinating humans.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, what management is doing now is absolutely evil and unethical.

The farther away people stay from documents, the bigger the risk of &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/10/07/stop-chatting-start-coding.html&quot;&gt;losing information&lt;/a&gt;. And lost information is the first source of trouble in any project.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Here is the list; it starts with the most damaging communication means and goes down to the most &lt;strong&gt;mature&lt;/strong&gt; and professional ones, which cause the least amount of trouble:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Coffee Breaks&lt;/strong&gt;. This is the most dangerous thing—you can never keep track of them, you won’t know what they were about, and there is no “search” button anywhere. Everything you say standing next to that coffee machine will be lost. Nothing will be converted to project artifacts.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phone Calls&lt;/strong&gt;. A bit better than coffee breaks but still a big issue. Phone calls are completely untraceable. Information you exchange on those calls is gone forever. Well, you can record them, but searching through phone call records is a tough task that nobody will do, ever.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meetings&lt;/strong&gt;. This is the next step after coffee breaks, because there is some structure and minutes. Meetings can be recorded (both on and offline), with their results filed somewhere and decisions documented. In reality, none of that will actually happen. Meetings will just kill your time and your sponsor’s money.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Emails&lt;/strong&gt;. If you can put some formality into emails and discipline all participants, your email history may be considered a project artifact in itself. How organized and easily browseable will that artifact be? That’s a good question. In most cases, it will just be a mess.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mailing Lists&lt;/strong&gt;. They are better than emails, because some software is archiving them and making them available and browseable. But it will be difficult to find where exactly what topic was discussed, where decisions were made and why, who suggested what, etc.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Slack&lt;/strong&gt;. There are many similar alternatives that are basically online chats. The main problem with all of them is that it’s difficult to categorize such a chat, group messages together, or find something later. It’s merely a flow of information that becomes useless just a few days after. Of course, if you really want to find something there, it’s possible. But the quality of such a “document” is very low.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trello&lt;/strong&gt;. By Trello I mean any task/ticket tracking system—they are great instruments to immediately turn conversations and discussions into project artifacts. You don’t need to document anything; it’s already there. The problem is that they are still rather far away from the main project artifact: the source code with its commits, merge conflicts, build logs, etc.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GitHub&lt;/strong&gt;. This is the best instrument you can use. It integrates communications with the product itself. The code you write and the discussions you have around it are literally in the same place.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Which one of these is your project using right now?

Some use Slack, Trello, or GitHub; others just sit together in the same room. There are many methods and tools. I believe it’s possible to rank them by the amount of <strong>damage</strong> they cause to your project. This is the list of all of them I’m aware of at the moment.</p><figure class="jb_picture"><img itemprop="image" alt="Schizopolis (1996) by Steven Soderbergh" src="/images/2016/08/schizopolis.jpg" longdesc="#0810a23a" /><figcaption id="0810a23a">Schizopolis (1996) by Steven Soderbergh</figcaption></figure><p>The damage I’m talking about is caused mostly by the distance between these communication channels and project artifacts. The farther away people stay from documents, the bigger the risk of <a href="/2014/10/07/stop-chatting-start-coding.html">losing information</a>. And lost information is the first source of trouble in any project.</p><p>Here is the list; it starts with the most damaging communication means and goes down to the most <strong>mature</strong> and professional ones, which cause the least amount of trouble:</p><ul> <li><p><strong>Coffee Breaks</strong>. This is the most dangerous thing—you can never keep track of them, you won’t know what they were about, and there is no “search” button anywhere. Everything you say standing next to that coffee machine will be lost. Nothing will be converted to project artifacts.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Phone Calls</strong>. A bit better than coffee breaks but still a big issue. Phone calls are completely untraceable. Information you exchange on those calls is gone forever. Well, you can record them, but searching through phone call records is a tough task that nobody will do, ever.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Meetings</strong>. This is the next step after coffee breaks, because there is some structure and minutes. Meetings can be recorded (both on and offline), with their results filed somewhere and decisions documented. In reality, none of that will actually happen. Meetings will just kill your time and your sponsor’s money.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Emails</strong>. If you can put some formality into emails and discipline all participants, your email history may be considered a project artifact in itself. How organized and easily browseable will that artifact be? That’s a good question. In most cases, it will just be a mess.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Mailing Lists</strong>. They are better than emails, because some software is archiving them and making them available and browseable. But it will be difficult to find where exactly what topic was discussed, where decisions were made and why, who suggested what, etc.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Slack</strong>. There are many similar alternatives that are basically online chats. The main problem with all of them is that it’s difficult to categorize such a chat, group messages together, or find something later. It’s merely a flow of information that becomes useless just a few days after. Of course, if you really want to find something there, it’s possible. But the quality of such a “document” is very low.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Trello</strong>. By Trello I mean any task/ticket tracking system—they are great instruments to immediately turn conversations and discussions into project artifacts. You don’t need to document anything; it’s already there. The problem is that they are still rather far away from the main project artifact: the source code with its commits, merge conflicts, build logs, etc.</p></li> <li><p><strong>GitHub</strong>. This is the best instrument you can use. It integrates communications with the product itself. The code you write and the discussions you have around it are literally in the same place.</p></li></ul><p>Which one of these is your project using right now?

I’ve missed the “can” word. A distributed team &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; deliver code of much higher quality than a co-located one, and now I’ll explain why. Of course, not every distributed team can do that. Most of them can’t even deliver code that works, let alone quality code. But if a team—a distributed one—is managed according to the principles I’ll explain now, the quality will be much higher than the same team can achieve if co-located. What I’m going to show you is that working in a &lt;a href=&quot;/2017/05/02/remote-slaves.html&quot;&gt;remote mode&lt;/a&gt;, if done right, &lt;em&gt;guarantees&lt;/em&gt; higher quality of code. Surprised?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;!--more--&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;jb_picture&quot;&gt;&lt;img itemprop=&quot;image&quot; alt=&quot;Ocean&amp;#39;s Twelve (2004) by Steven Soderbergh&quot; src=&quot;/images/2016/08/oceans-twelve.jpg&quot; longdesc=&quot;#f8486009&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption id=&quot;f8486009&quot;&gt;Ocean&amp;#39;s Twelve (2004) by Steven Soderbergh&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are basically four simple ingredients to success … you know what, there is actually &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; main ingredient, and its name is &lt;em&gt;control&lt;/em&gt;. If we want quality to be at some level, we have to &lt;em&gt;enforce&lt;/em&gt; it. We can’t just declare it; we need to &lt;em&gt;make&lt;/em&gt; it high.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Quality can be achieved only if it is controlled and enforced.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;How do software teams make high-quality code? Oh, there are many proven methods. First, you need a very modern office where &lt;del&gt;programmers&lt;/del&gt; developers sit on cushioned chairs, play table tennis, drink smoothies, and write diagrams on walls. Second, you should buy them many books. Books have to be everywhere in the office, and they have to be about everything from Python and Haskell to Docker, Agile, and lean startups. The more books, the higher the quality of the code they write. And third, you have to pay them well. The more expensive the developer is, the higher the quality he or she writes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I’m sure you understand that I’m joking. None of these “proven methods” will either guarantee quality or motivate serious software engineers. Quality can be achieved only if it is &lt;em&gt;controlled and enforced&lt;/em&gt;. And this is also what motivates programmers best of all—the fact that the quality is so important for management that they find mechanisms of control and enforcement, and they invest in them. Table tennis and lean startup books are not even close to those mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So, now let’s discuss those four ingredients of quality enforcement, which we practice in our projects:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read-Only Master Branch&lt;/strong&gt;. Nobody can make changes directly to the master branch; neither the architect nor the project sponsor. The master branch is technically read-only. This means that in order to compromise the quality of our code, everyone has to go through a pull request, pre-flight build, and automated merge procedure.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chats Are Prohibited&lt;/strong&gt;. Any modification to our code base, even a very small one, must be submitted in a pull request. A code review must also occur in the pull request. We strictly disallow any &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/08/23/communication-maturity.html&quot;&gt;informal communications&lt;/a&gt; between programmers, including chats, phone calls, emails, or face-to-face discussions. This means that the chances of quality compromises due to friendship, informal agreements, and trade-offs are very low.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Build Is Fragile&lt;/strong&gt;. We believe that the higher the quality bar, the more difficult it is to modify any piece of code without breaking the build. We put a lot of quality checks right into the build to make the lives of programmers more difficult. Well, this is not our goal, but it happens. The code has to pass all static analysis checks, a test coverage threshold, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation_testing&quot;&gt;mutation coverage&lt;/a&gt; threshold, and many others. This means that bad code won’t reach the repo, ever.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Micro Payments for Deliverables&lt;/strong&gt;. We pay only for closed tickets, and they are each very small (up to two hours). We don’t pay for time spent in the office or in front of the computer. We pay only when tickets are closed—no close, no pay. This means that programmers are motivated to &lt;em&gt;close&lt;/em&gt; them, nothing else.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thus, as you can see, there is an intentionally created conflict. On one hand, programmers have to close tickets and deliver working code. On the other hand, it’s rather difficult to do; because the quality bar is high, there is no room to make compromises, and there is no technical possibility to go around an issue. Good programmers survive in this conflict and manage to deliver and get paid. Well-paid.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And now, to the main point of this blog post—do you think it’s possible to build all that in a co-located team? I don’t think so. First of all, you won’t be able to prohibit &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/08/23/communication-maturity.html&quot;&gt;informal communications&lt;/a&gt;. No matter how many times you ask developers to communicate in tickets, they will resolve most of their technical questions face-to-face. It’s inevitable.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;People are people; nobody likes to hit that quality bar multiple times a day&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;Second, you won’t be able to pay for results only, because programmers will complain that they are doing a lot of communication in the office that has to be paid somehow. In reality, they will spend two to three hours per day on actually writing code, and the rest of the time will be spent on coffee breaks, Trump talks, and Facebook scrolling. Again, it’s inevitable.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And third, people are people. Nobody likes to hit that quality bar multiple times a day. They will complain, and eventually you will give them direct access to the master branch. First, you will give it to the architect, then to a few senior developers, then to a few good friends who you absolutely trust. Then to everybody, just in case. It’s inevitable.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To summarize, I believe that co-located teams are just not made for quality programming. For fun—yes. For creativity—maybe. For burning investors’ money—absolutely.

I’ve missed the “can” word. A distributed team <em>can</em> deliver code of much higher quality than a co-located one, and now I’ll explain why. Of course, not every distributed team can do that. Most of them can’t even deliver code that works, let alone quality code. But if a team—a distributed one—is managed according to the principles I’ll explain now, the quality will be much higher than the same team can achieve if co-located. What I’m going to show you is that working in a <a href="/2017/05/02/remote-slaves.html">remote mode</a>, if done right, <em>guarantees</em> higher quality of code. Surprised?</p><figure class="jb_picture"><img itemprop="image" alt="Ocean&#39;s Twelve (2004) by Steven Soderbergh" src="/images/2016/08/oceans-twelve.jpg" longdesc="#f8486009" /><figcaption id="f8486009">Ocean&#39;s Twelve (2004) by Steven Soderbergh</figcaption></figure><p>There are basically four simple ingredients to success … you know what, there is actually <em>one</em> main ingredient, and its name is <em>control</em>. If we want quality to be at some level, we have to <em>enforce</em> it. We can’t just declare it; we need to <em>make</em> it high.</p><aside class="quote">Quality can be achieved only if it is controlled and enforced.</aside><p>How do software teams make high-quality code? Oh, there are many proven methods. First, you need a very modern office where <del>programmers</del> developers sit on cushioned chairs, play table tennis, drink smoothies, and write diagrams on walls. Second, you should buy them many books. Books have to be everywhere in the office, and they have to be about everything from Python and Haskell to Docker, Agile, and lean startups. The more books, the higher the quality of the code they write. And third, you have to pay them well. The more expensive the developer is, the higher the quality he or she writes.</p><p>I’m sure you understand that I’m joking. None of these “proven methods” will either guarantee quality or motivate serious software engineers. Quality can be achieved only if it is <em>controlled and enforced</em>. And this is also what motivates programmers best of all—the fact that the quality is so important for management that they find mechanisms of control and enforcement, and they invest in them. Table tennis and lean startup books are not even close to those mechanisms.</p><p>So, now let’s discuss those four ingredients of quality enforcement, which we practice in our projects:</p><ul> <li><p><strong>Read-Only Master Branch</strong>. Nobody can make changes directly to the master branch; neither the architect nor the project sponsor. The master branch is technically read-only. This means that in order to compromise the quality of our code, everyone has to go through a pull request, pre-flight build, and automated merge procedure.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Chats Are Prohibited</strong>. Any modification to our code base, even a very small one, must be submitted in a pull request. A code review must also occur in the pull request. We strictly disallow any <a href="/2016/08/23/communication-maturity.html">informal communications</a> between programmers, including chats, phone calls, emails, or face-to-face discussions. This means that the chances of quality compromises due to friendship, informal agreements, and trade-offs are very low.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Build Is Fragile</strong>. We believe that the higher the quality bar, the more difficult it is to modify any piece of code without breaking the build. We put a lot of quality checks right into the build to make the lives of programmers more difficult. Well, this is not our goal, but it happens. The code has to pass all static analysis checks, a test coverage threshold, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation_testing">mutation coverage</a> threshold, and many others. This means that bad code won’t reach the repo, ever.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Micro Payments for Deliverables</strong>. We pay only for closed tickets, and they are each very small (up to two hours). We don’t pay for time spent in the office or in front of the computer. We pay only when tickets are closed—no close, no pay. This means that programmers are motivated to <em>close</em> them, nothing else.</p></li></ul><p>Thus, as you can see, there is an intentionally created conflict. On one hand, programmers have to close tickets and deliver working code. On the other hand, it’s rather difficult to do; because the quality bar is high, there is no room to make compromises, and there is no technical possibility to go around an issue. Good programmers survive in this conflict and manage to deliver and get paid. Well-paid.</p><p>And now, to the main point of this blog post—do you think it’s possible to build all that in a co-located team? I don’t think so. First of all, you won’t be able to prohibit <a href="/2016/08/23/communication-maturity.html">informal communications</a>. No matter how many times you ask developers to communicate in tickets, they will resolve most of their technical questions face-to-face. It’s inevitable.</p><aside class="quote">People are people; nobody likes to hit that quality bar multiple times a day</aside><p>Second, you won’t be able to pay for results only, because programmers will complain that they are doing a lot of communication in the office that has to be paid somehow. In reality, they will spend two to three hours per day on actually writing code, and the rest of the time will be spent on coffee breaks, Trump talks, and Facebook scrolling. Again, it’s inevitable.</p><p>And third, people are people. Nobody likes to hit that quality bar multiple times a day. They will complain, and eventually you will give them direct access to the master branch. First, you will give it to the architect, then to a few senior developers, then to a few good friends who you absolutely trust. Then to everybody, just in case. It’s inevitable.</p><p>To summarize, I believe that co-located teams are just not made for quality programming. For fun—yes. For creativity—maybe. For burning investors’ money—absolutely. For quality—not really.</p></p><nav class="buttons notranslate desktop-only"> <a href="http://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://www.yegor256.com/2016/08/05/distributed-teams-are-higher-quality.html" title="Share on Facebook" class="button" rel="nofollow"> <span class="count count-facebook">0</span> <i class="icon icon-facebook notranslate" aria-hidden="true"></i> </a> <a href="https://twitter.com/share?url=https://www.yegor256.com/2016/08/05/distributed-teams-are-higher-quality.html&amp;text=A+Distributed+Team+Delivers+Code+of+Higher+Quality" title="Share on Twitter" class="button" rel="nofollow"> <span class="count count-twitter">0</span> <i class="icon icon-twitter notranslate" aria-hidden="true"></i> </a> <a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=https://www.yegor256.com/2016/08/05/distributed-teams-are-higher-quality.html" title="Share on Google+" class="button" rel="nofollow"> <span class="count count-googleplus">0</span> <i class="icon icon-googleplus notranslate" aria-hidden="true"></i> </a> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/cws/share?url=https://www.yegor256.com/2016/08/05/distributed-teams-are-higher-quality.html" title="Share on LinkedIn" class="button" rel="nofollow"> <span class="count count-linkedin">0</span> <i class="icon icon-linkedin notranslate" aria-hidden="true"></i> </a> <a href="http://reddit.com/submit?url=https://www.yegor256.com/2016/08/05/distributed-teams-are-higher-quality.html%3F2016-31&amp;title=A+Distributed+Team+Delivers+Code+of+Higher+Quality" title="Share on Reddit" class="button" rel="nofollow"> <span class="count count-reddit">0</span> <i class="icon icon-reddit notranslate" aria-hidden="true"></i> </a> <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/submitlink?u=https://www.yegor256.com/2016/08/05/distributed-teams-are-higher-quality.html%3F2016-31&amp;t=A+Distributed+Team+Delivers+Code+of+Higher+Quality" title="Share on Hacker News" class="button" rel="nofollow"> <span class="count count-hackernews">0</span> <i class="icon icon-hackernews notranslate" aria-hidden="true"></i> </a> </nav> </header> <article class="main" itemprop="articleBody"><div ><p>OK, the title is not exactly accurate.

But one question still remains unanswered, and it often turns into a problem in our projects: What does a software architect do when the project sponsor doesn’t like his technical decisions? The architect implements something in a certain way, and the sponsor (or its representative) says that it’s not exactly how things should work. What’s next?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;!--more--&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;jb_picture&quot;&gt;&lt;img itemprop=&quot;image&quot; alt=&quot;Beasts of No Nation (2015) by Cary Joji Fukunaga&quot; src=&quot;/images/2016/07/beasts-of-no-nation.jpg&quot; longdesc=&quot;#85480753&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption id=&quot;85480753&quot;&gt;Beasts of No Nation (2015) by Cary Joji Fukunaga&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;In our projects, a product owner (PO) is usually a representative of a project sponsor (the paying customer). Since all our projects are rather complex Java software packages, POs are very technical people. They are programmers or used to be programmers. They understand the code we write, and they want their opinion to be taken into account and respected.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And I’m not talking about &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/01/05/how-to-be-honest-and-keep-customer.html&quot;&gt;stupid&lt;/a&gt; product owners—those guys are a separate story. I’m talking about a pretty reasonable PO with his own technical opinion that needs to be heard.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Here is a practical example. Last week, I was &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/08/04/nine-steps-start-software-project.html&quot;&gt;starting&lt;/a&gt; a project. I was an architect. It was a Java server-side module. I decided to use Maven as a build automation system.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I created some initial files, configured &lt;code&gt;pom.xml&lt;/code&gt;, briefly explained the project structure in &lt;code&gt;README.md&lt;/code&gt;, and submitted a pull request. Chris, the product owner, reviewed it and asked, “Why not Gradle?”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It was a reasonable question, right? Gradle is another popular build automation system that I could have used, but I didn’t. The question is why. It was a pretty innocent question, and I explained the answer right there in my comment to the pull request. I said Maven was more suitable in this project because … blah blah blah.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But Chris argued back. He was still thinking Gradle was the better choice. He had his reasons. Meanwhile, I tried to &lt;strong&gt;convince&lt;/strong&gt; him of mine. I tried a few times and then realized I was doing something wrong. It shouldn’t work like that.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A software architect should not convince a product owner, a customer, or anybody else. Instead, an architect must make his decisions and be responsible for the entire success or failure of the product, just like I &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/10/12/who-is-software-architect.html&quot;&gt;explained before&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;A good architect must collect different opinions before making his own decision.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;There is a simple reason for that. Any attempt to convince anyone causes a possibility of “responsibility leakage.” What if I fail to convince? I will have to change my plan and use Gradle, right? What if the product has problems because of that decision? I will try to blame Chris for that, right? I can’t be &lt;strong&gt;fully&lt;/strong&gt; responsible for the product anymore, because I was “forced” to make at least one decision.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Don’t get me wrong; a good architect must collect different opinions before making his own decision. But collecting Chris’s opinion would look very different. I would ask him first what he thinks about Maven and Gradle. He would tell me that he doesn’t like Maven because of this and that. And I would take that into account. Or maybe not. But my decision would still be mine, made by myself, under no compulsion by anybody. And Chris would still be able to blame me for any negative consequences of that decision.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But what should Chris do if he really doesn’t like my decision? It’s his money and his product, right? He does care. And he doesn’t want to have Maven in &lt;strong&gt;his&lt;/strong&gt; product. What does he do? How can he influence my decision-making process?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s easy. There are two documents in each software project. The first one is &lt;strong&gt;requirements&lt;/strong&gt;, and the second one is &lt;strong&gt;architecture&lt;/strong&gt;. Chris should use them both to correct me and point me in the right direction. Here’s how.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;First, if he really doesn’t want to have Maven, he should make changes to the requirements document. He should add something like “the build system must be Gradle, because …” Or maybe even without the “because” part. It’s up to him. In that case, I will have to take that into account, and I will. I know my design decisions are dictated by the requirements. And not because Chris convinced me or I failed to convince him, but because that’s what the document says.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;An architect must be an absolute technical dictator during the project and must not have to convince anyone.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;Second, if he is not entirely sure that Gradle is the right choice and just wants me to be more serious about my decisions, he should complain (by submitting a bug) about the quality of my &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/08/04/nine-steps-start-software-project.html&quot;&gt;architecture document&lt;/a&gt;. He should say the choice to go with Maven is not explained properly. I will then rethink my decision and will either change it or explain it better. But again, I will do it not to please Chris but to fix a reported bug.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To summarize, an architect must be an absolute technical &lt;strong&gt;dictator&lt;/strong&gt; during the project and must not have to convince anyone. If that’s not the case, the entire project faces big risks, simply because the responsibility will be “leaking.”&lt;/p&gt; " /> <meta name="keywords" content="next, path, output, content, previous, url, relative_path, id, collection, excerpt, draft, categories, layout, title, date, place, tags, description, keywords, image, jb_picture, slug, ext" /> <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1"/> <meta name="google-site-verification" content="JEj_gQr2CPe2QKGw8XdMz0R7VboQIUbX3FlM-lwTq-8" /> <meta name="author" content="Yegor Bugayenko"> <meta name="article:published_time" content="2016-07-21 00:00:00 +0000"> <meta name="og:site_name" content="Yegor Bugayenko"/> <meta name="og:type" content="article" /> <meta name="og:locale" content="en_US" /> <meta name="twitter:account_id" content="4503599630178231" /> <meta name="twitter:creator" content="@yegor256"/> <meta name="twitter:site" content="@yegor256"/> <meta name="twitter:title" property="og:title" content="Convince Me!"/> <meta name="twitter:description" property="og:description" content="&lt;p&gt;I’ve already explained how I understand the &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/10/12/who-is-software-architect.html&quot;&gt;role&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/05/11/software-architect-responsibilities.html&quot;&gt;responsibilities&lt;/a&gt; of a software architect. But one question still remains unanswered, and it often turns into a problem in our projects: What does a software architect do when the project sponsor doesn’t like his technical decisions? The architect implements something in a certain way, and the sponsor (or its representative) says that it’s not exactly how things should work. What’s next?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;!--more--&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;jb_picture&quot;&gt;&lt;img itemprop=&quot;image&quot; alt=&quot;Beasts of No Nation (2015) by Cary Joji Fukunaga&quot; src=&quot;/images/2016/07/beasts-of-no-nation.jpg&quot; longdesc=&quot;#85480753&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption id=&quot;85480753&quot;&gt;Beasts of No Nation (2015) by Cary Joji Fukunaga&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;In our projects, a product owner (PO) is usually a representative of a project sponsor (the paying customer). Since all our projects are rather complex Java software packages, POs are very technical people. They are programmers or used to be programmers. They understand the code we write, and they want their opinion to be taken into account and respected.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And I’m not talking about &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/01/05/how-to-be-honest-and-keep-customer.html&quot;&gt;stupid&lt;/a&gt; product owners—those guys are a separate story. I’m talking about a pretty reasonable PO with his own technical opinion that needs to be heard.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Here is a practical example. Last week, I was &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/08/04/nine-steps-start-software-project.html&quot;&gt;starting&lt;/a&gt; a project. I was an architect. It was a Java server-side module. I decided to use Maven as a build automation system.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I created some initial files, configured &lt;code&gt;pom.xml&lt;/code&gt;, briefly explained the project structure in &lt;code&gt;README.md&lt;/code&gt;, and submitted a pull request. Chris, the product owner, reviewed it and asked, “Why not Gradle?”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It was a reasonable question, right? Gradle is another popular build automation system that I could have used, but I didn’t. The question is why. It was a pretty innocent question, and I explained the answer right there in my comment to the pull request. I said Maven was more suitable in this project because … blah blah blah.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But Chris argued back. He was still thinking Gradle was the better choice. He had his reasons. Meanwhile, I tried to &lt;strong&gt;convince&lt;/strong&gt; him of mine. I tried a few times and then realized I was doing something wrong. It shouldn’t work like that.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A software architect should not convince a product owner, a customer, or anybody else. Instead, an architect must make his decisions and be responsible for the entire success or failure of the product, just like I &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/10/12/who-is-software-architect.html&quot;&gt;explained before&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;A good architect must collect different opinions before making his own decision.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;There is a simple reason for that. Any attempt to convince anyone causes a possibility of “responsibility leakage.” What if I fail to convince? I will have to change my plan and use Gradle, right? What if the product has problems because of that decision? I will try to blame Chris for that, right? I can’t be &lt;strong&gt;fully&lt;/strong&gt; responsible for the product anymore, because I was “forced” to make at least one decision.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Don’t get me wrong; a good architect must collect different opinions before making his own decision.

They understand the code we write, and they want their opinion to be taken into account and respected.</p><p>And I’m not talking about <a href="/2015/01/05/how-to-be-honest-and-keep-customer.html">stupid</a> product owners—those guys are a separate story. I’m talking about a pretty reasonable PO with his own technical opinion that needs to be heard.</p><p>Here is a practical example. Last week, I was <a href="/2015/08/04/nine-steps-start-software-project.html">starting</a> a project. I was an architect. It was a Java server-side module. I decided to use Maven as a build automation system.</p><p>I created some initial files, configured <code>pom.xml</code>, briefly explained the project structure in <code>README.md</code>, and submitted a pull request. Chris, the product owner, reviewed it and asked, “Why not Gradle?”</p><p>It was a reasonable question, right? Gradle is another popular build automation system that I could have used, but I didn’t. The question is why. It was a pretty innocent question, and I explained the answer right there in my comment to the pull request. I said Maven was more suitable in this project because … blah blah blah.</p><p>But Chris argued back. He was still thinking Gradle was the better choice. He had his reasons. Meanwhile, I tried to <strong>convince</strong> him of mine. I tried a few times and then realized I was doing something wrong. It shouldn’t work like that.</p><p>A software architect should not convince a product owner, a customer, or anybody else. Instead, an architect must make his decisions and be responsible for the entire success or failure of the product, just like I <a href="/2014/10/12/who-is-software-architect.html">explained before</a>.</p><aside class="quote">A good architect must collect different opinions before making his own decision.</aside><p>There is a simple reason for that. Any attempt to convince anyone causes a possibility of “responsibility leakage.” What if I fail to convince? I will have to change my plan and use Gradle, right? What if the product has problems because of that decision? I will try to blame Chris for that, right? I can’t be <strong>fully</strong> responsible for the product anymore, because I was “forced” to make at least one decision.</p><p>Don’t get me wrong; a good architect must collect different opinions before making his own decision. But collecting Chris’s opinion would look very different. I would ask him first what he thinks about Maven and Gradle. He would tell me that he doesn’t like Maven because of this and that. And I would take that into account. Or maybe not. But my decision would still be mine, made by myself, under no compulsion by anybody. And Chris would still be able to blame me for any negative consequences of that decision.</p><p>But what should Chris do if he really doesn’t like my decision? It’s his money and his product, right? He does care. And he doesn’t want to have Maven in <strong>his</strong> product. What does he do? How can he influence my decision-making process?</p><p>It’s easy. There are two documents in each software project. The first one is <strong>requirements</strong>, and the second one is <strong>architecture</strong>. Chris should use them both to correct me and point me in the right direction. Here’s how.</p><p>First, if he really doesn’t want to have Maven, he should make changes to the requirements document. He should add something like “the build system must be Gradle, because …” Or maybe even without the “because” part. It’s up to him. In that case, I will have to take that into account, and I will. I know my design decisions are dictated by the requirements. And not because Chris convinced me or I failed to convince him, but because that’s what the document says.</p><aside class="quote">An architect must be an absolute technical dictator during the project and must not have to convince anyone.</aside><p>Second, if he is not entirely sure that Gradle is the right choice and just wants me to be more serious about my decisions, he should complain (by submitting a bug) about the quality of my <a href="/2015/08/04/nine-steps-start-software-project.html">architecture document</a>. He should say the choice to go with Maven is not explained properly. I will then rethink my decision and will either change it or explain it better. But again, I will do it not to please Chris but to fix a reported bug.</p><p>To summarize, an architect must be an absolute technical <strong>dictator</strong> during the project and must not have to convince anyone. If that’s not the case, the entire project faces big risks, simply because the responsibility will be “leaking.”</p></div></article></div><div class="wrapper"> <related-posts /></div><div class="disqus" role="complementary"><p class="disqus_hint"> Please, use <a href="https://help.disqus.com/commenting/what-html-tags-are-allowed-within-comments">syntax highlighting</a> in your comments, to make them more readable.</p><div id="disqus_thread" class="disqus-thread"> <a>&nbsp;</a></div><script> var disqus_config = function () { this.page.url = document.location.href.split('?')[0].split('#')[0].replace('https://', 'http://'); this.page.identifier = this.page.url; }; (function() { var d = document, s = d.createElement('script'); s.src = '//yegor256.disqus.com/embed.js'; s.setAttribute('data-timestamp', +new Date()); (d.head || d.body).appendChild(s); })(); </script> <noscript><div><p class="red"> JavaScript is disabled in your browser, that's why you can't see comments under this post.</p></div></noscript></div><div class="wrapper"> <footer class="footer"><p> &copy; <span itemscope="" itemprop="copyrightHolder" itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"> <span itemprop="name">Yegor Bugayenko</span> </span> 2014&ndash;<span itemprop="copyrightYear">2018</span></p></footer></div></section><div class="wrapper unprintable" style="text-align:center;margin-top:2em;"> <a href="http://www.sixnines.io/h/3ba1652f"> <img src="//www.sixnines.io/b/3ba1652f?style=flat" alt="sixnines availability badge"/> </a></div><script src="//code.jquery.com/jquery-1.9.0.min.js"></script> <script src="/js/all.js?c998b88f617"></script> <script>var disqus_shortname = 'yegor256';</script> <script id="dsq-count-scr" src="//yegor256.disqus.com/count.js" async="async"></script> <script> (function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){ (i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o), m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m) })(window,document,'script','//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga'); ga('create', 'UA-1963507-32', 'auto'); ga('send', 'pageview'); </script> <script> Cd=document;Cr="&"+Math.random();Cp="&s=1"; Cd.cookie="b=b";if(Cd.cookie)Cp+="&c=1"; Cp+="&t="+(new Date()).getTimezoneOffset(); if(self!=top)Cp+="&f=1"; </script> <script> if(navigator.javaEnabled())Cp+="&j=1"; </script> <script> if(typeof(screen)!='undefined')Cp+="&w="+screen.width+"&h="+ screen.height+"&d="+(screen.colorDepth?screen.colorDepth:screen.pixelDepth); </script> <script> Cd.write("<img src='//c.hit.ua/hit?i=95870&g=0&x=2"+Cp+Cr+ "&r="+escape(Cd.referrer)+"&u="+escape(window.location.href)+ "' border='0' wi"+"dth='1' he"+"ight='1'/>"); </script> <script type="application/ld+json"> { "@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Person", "name": "Yegor Bugayenko", "url": "https://www.yegor256.com", "sameAs": [ "https://www.facebook.com/yegor256", "https://instagram.com/yegor256", "https://www.linkedin.com/in/yegor256", "https://twitter.com/yegor256", "https://github.com/yegor256", "https://www.pinterest.com/yegor256/" ] } </script> </body> </html> <!DOCTYPE html> <html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/WebSite"> <head> <meta charset="utf-8"/> <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Nowadays, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.agilemanifesto.org/&quot;&gt;Agile Manifesto&lt;/a&gt; is a Bible of numerous software teams.

They think that a &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/01/26/happy-boss-false-objective.html&quot;&gt;happy customer&lt;/a&gt; is their true objective, while “continuous delivery” is something that obviously helps, though not crucially. However, this is quite the opposite—the customer will be satisfied &lt;em&gt;if&lt;/em&gt; the software is perfectly created and delivered. If the customer is not satisfied, we find another customer—that’s the true spirit a professional software team should adhere to. I believe that’s what the Manifesto means. We make sure that our process is “early and continuous,” which will result to customer satisfaction. We focus on improving our process, not satisfying the customer. Satisfaction is the consequence, not the primary objective.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Principle #2&lt;/strong&gt;: “Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer’s competitive advantage.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Most Agile teams understand the word “welcome” here as a permission to forget about any &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/11/10/ten-mistakes-in-specs.html&quot;&gt;requirements&lt;/a&gt; management at all. What is the easiest way to welcome change? Obviously, just get rid of any requirement documents! In this case, any change will be welcome, since it won’t affect anything. There simply won’t be anything to affect. But this is not what the Manifesto means! This principle means that our requirements management process is so &lt;em&gt;powerful&lt;/em&gt; that it can accept change at any moment. However, it’s rather difficult to achieve, if requirements are actually documented.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;youtube&quot;&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZoJ3gO4PSo&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;box&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://i.ytimg.com/vi/sZoJ3gO4PSo/mqdefault.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;YouTube video #sZoJ3gO4PSo&quot; /&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;play&quot;&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;icon icon-play&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;div&gt;Who Manages Who? (in Russian with English subtitles); 5 June 2016.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Principle #3&lt;/strong&gt;: “Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This terrific rule is usually understood as an order for the entire team. The team has to frequently deliver, while programmers are free to deliver almost nothing and who knows when. I think the Manifesto here is emphasizing on both individual and group responsibilities to frequently deliver. I also think that this frequency should be way higher than just a “couple of weeks.” Today, with modern technologies and instruments, we can deliver way faster—several times a day.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Principle #4&lt;/strong&gt;: “Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Working together means quicker turnarounds in communication not lack or roles and responsibilities.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;Working together doesn’t mean working without clearly defined rules and processes. However, most teams understand this principle as a legalization of chaos. They think that since we work together, we don’t need to define roles any more, we should not document &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/11/10/ten-mistakes-in-specs.html&quot;&gt;requirements&lt;/a&gt;, we shouldn’t care about responsibilities. Ultimately in the end, we neither know who is doing what nor the team’s structure. That’s not what the Manifesto is talking about! “Working together” means quicker turnarounds in communication and shorter response cycles. It definitely doesn’t mean lack of roles and responsibilities.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Principle #5&lt;/strong&gt;: “Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Trust doesn't mean lack of control.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;Trust is a great word and concept, but it doesn’t replace another equally great word—control. Most Agile teams think that trust means exactly that—complete lack of any validation, verification, responsibility, and control. “We trust our programmers to write perfect codes”—I’ve heard that countless times which is simply wrong. This principle means something completely different. It means that when clearly defined tasks are assigned to their performers, we fully delegate responsibilities to them. We &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/09/24/why-monetary-awards-dont-work.html&quot;&gt;motivate&lt;/a&gt; them to be fully responsible for the end result. However, we &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/02/16/it-is-not-a-school.html&quot;&gt;don’t help&lt;/a&gt; them. Instead, we trust them as self-sufficient individuals, capable of completing assigned tasks on their own.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Principle #6&lt;/strong&gt;: “The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Face-to-face doesn't mean at the same office, especially now.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;Face-to-face doesn’t mean sitting in the same office. The Manifesto doesn’t say anything about co-located or distributed teams. It’s obvious that in modern software projects, virtual communications (over video calls) are way more effective than staying together in the same country, same city, same office, and same room. Therefore, most Agile adepts still promote on-site development style, using Agile Manifesto as proof. That’s a mistake; face-to-face means something totally different from what it meant 15 years ago, when the Manifesto was written.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Principle #7&lt;/strong&gt;: “Working software is the primary measure of progress.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This doesn’t mean that we should not measure anything else. Of course, the working software is the &lt;em&gt;primary&lt;/em&gt; measure, but there are many other measures, which we can and must use. For example, the amount of features documented, implemented and delivered; or the amount of lines of code added to the project (don’t smile, &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/11/14/hits-of-code.html&quot;&gt;read&lt;/a&gt;); or the amount of &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/09/10/testing-exit-criteria.html&quot;&gt;bugs found&lt;/a&gt;; or the amounts of &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/01/19/how-expensive-is-outsourcing.html&quot;&gt;dollars spent&lt;/a&gt;. There are many other metrics. We can use many of them. However, a typical mistake many Agile teams are doing is just ignoring them all. They say “we measure only the end result.” That’s not what the Manifesto is suggesting to do though.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Principle #8&lt;/strong&gt;: “Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;We must remember that any project is first of all a money burning machine.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;This doesn’t mean that we should indefinitely &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/06/02/how-to-estimate-software-cost.html&quot;&gt;burn&lt;/a&gt; customers’ money. Yes, we should be developing at some given speed, but we should always remember whose money we’re spending—customers’ money. The Manifesto doesn’t say anything about the cost of development and that’s probably because it was written by those who make money (programmers), not those who spend it (customers). We must therefore remember that any project is first of all a money burning machine. That’s why the team must always measure its &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/01/19/how-expensive-is-outsourcing.html&quot;&gt;burn rate&lt;/a&gt; and make sure it’s aligned with the amount of business value the team delivers. Just being a &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/03/02/team-morale-myths-and-reality.html&quot;&gt;happy team&lt;/a&gt; is not what the Manifesto suggests, but that’s exactly how many understand this principle.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Principle #9&lt;/strong&gt;: “Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That’s a perfect principle that says so much and doesn’t say anything at the same time. What exactly is “attention?” I can explain. It means &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/10/13/competition-without-rules.html&quot;&gt;rules and policies&lt;/a&gt;. First of all, any policy means &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/01/05/how-to-punish-employees.html&quot;&gt;punishment&lt;/a&gt; to those who violate rules. Thus, if an Agile team really means continuous attention to technical excellence, it must have a &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/08/13/strict-code-quality-control.html&quot;&gt;quality policy&lt;/a&gt;. That policy must clearly define which design is good and which is bad, which piece of Java code is excellent, which is ugly, etc. Additionally, the policy must say what happens to those who &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/11/24/imprisonment-for-irresponsible-coding.html&quot;&gt;violate&lt;/a&gt; the principles of excellence. However, most Agile teams understand “quality” as a great flag to hang on the wall, but get scared when I ask, “what happens if someone delivers low quality?.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Principle #10&lt;/strong&gt;: “Simplicity—the art of maximizing the amount of work not done—is essential.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That’s a great rule which most Agile teams don’t follow at all. This principle means that our tasks are small and simple enough to make sure they are either doable or cancellable. Huge tasks are the biggest threat to manageability of any team, be it Agile or not. This principle encourages us to give programmers small tasks, which they can easily be completed. However, most of Agile adepts simplicity being equal to stupidity. They are not equal. A simple task doesn’t mean a stupid or non-important tasks. A simple task is a clearly defined, small, and doable work order.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Principle #11&lt;/strong&gt;: “The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Self-organized doesn't mean un-organized.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;Self-organized doesn’t mean un-organized. This rule is often translated as a legalization of &lt;em&gt;anarchy&lt;/em&gt;. We don’t need any project managers, processes, discipline, rules, or policies—we’ve got &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/02/18/holacracy-autocracy.html&quot;&gt;holacracy&lt;/a&gt; instead! We also don’t need a software architect—our programmers can make all technical decisions at regular &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/07/13/meetings-are-legalized-robbery.html&quot;&gt;meetings&lt;/a&gt;! Furthermore, we don’t want our programmers to be individually responsible for anything—they are always together in all risks and issues. Stop that nonsense! This is not what the Manifesto means. A self-organizing team is a team that doesn’t need any supervision from the outside; a team that has clearly defined roles from the inside; a team with a perfect inner discipline; a team with professional &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/05/24/who-is-project-manager.html&quot;&gt;management&lt;/a&gt;. Not with the lack of all that.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Principle #12&lt;/strong&gt;: “At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That’s a great principle which is translated into so-called retrospective meetings. They work just fine as long as decisions make the team better. Unfortunately, in most cases, programmers in Agile teams are trying to &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/10/06/how-to-be-good-office-slave.html&quot;&gt;survive&lt;/a&gt;, instead of making their teams more effective. Even though the principle says that the team has to become more effective, those retrospective meetings help programmers to become more effective (read “more secure”) in the team. That’s only natural for people, but leads to the overall degradation of the team. It’s well known that the best team is the one that is capable of quickly and inevitably &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/09/16/how-to-fire-someone-right.html&quot;&gt;rejecting&lt;/a&gt; bad elements. Does your team do that effectively? Do retrospective meetings help in that? I doubt it. Therefore, I believe that what the Manifesto means here is not the meetings. It means that the team must have an effective mechanism of self-regulation and self-improvement. Additionally, retrospective meetings simply can’t be that mechanism because they prevent the team from making difficult disciplinary decisions.&lt;/p&gt; " /> <meta name="keywords" content="next, path, output, content, previous, url, relative_path, id, collection, excerpt, draft, categories, layout, title, date, place, tags, description, keywords, image, jb_picture, slug, ext" /> <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1"/> <meta name="google-site-verification" content="JEj_gQr2CPe2QKGw8XdMz0R7VboQIUbX3FlM-lwTq-8" /> <meta name="author" content="Yegor Bugayenko"> <meta name="article:published_time" content="2016-07-11 00:00:00 +0000"> <meta name="og:site_name" content="Yegor Bugayenko"/> <meta name="og:type" content="article" /> <meta name="og:locale" content="en_US" /> <meta name="twitter:account_id" content="4503599630178231" /> <meta name="twitter:creator" content="@yegor256"/> <meta name="twitter:site" content="@yegor256"/> <meta name="twitter:title" property="og:title" content="Twelve Mistakes in Agile Manifesto"/> <meta name="twitter:description" property="og:description" content="&lt;p&gt;Nowadays, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.agilemanifesto.org/&quot;&gt;Agile Manifesto&lt;/a&gt; is a Bible of numerous software teams.

I also think that this frequency should be way higher than just a “couple of weeks.” Today, with modern technologies and instruments, we can deliver way faster—several times a day.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Principle #4&lt;/strong&gt;: “Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Working together means quicker turnarounds in communication not lack or roles and responsibilities.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;Working together doesn’t mean working without clearly defined rules and processes. However, most teams understand this principle as a legalization of chaos. They think that since we work together, we don’t need to define roles any more, we should not document &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/11/10/ten-mistakes-in-specs.html&quot;&gt;requirements&lt;/a&gt;, we shouldn’t care about responsibilities. Ultimately in the end, we neither know who is doing what nor the team’s structure. That’s not what the Manifesto is talking about! “Working together” means quicker turnarounds in communication and shorter response cycles. It definitely doesn’t mean lack of roles and responsibilities.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Principle #5&lt;/strong&gt;: “Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Trust doesn't mean lack of control.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;Trust is a great word and concept, but it doesn’t replace another equally great word—control. Most Agile teams think that trust means exactly that—complete lack of any validation, verification, responsibility, and control. “We trust our programmers to write perfect codes”—I’ve heard that countless times which is simply wrong. This principle means something completely different. It means that when clearly defined tasks are assigned to their performers, we fully delegate responsibilities to them. We &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/09/24/why-monetary-awards-dont-work.html&quot;&gt;motivate&lt;/a&gt; them to be fully responsible for the end result. However, we &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/02/16/it-is-not-a-school.html&quot;&gt;don’t help&lt;/a&gt; them. Instead, we trust them as self-sufficient individuals, capable of completing assigned tasks on their own.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Principle #6&lt;/strong&gt;: “The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Face-to-face doesn't mean at the same office, especially now.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;Face-to-face doesn’t mean sitting in the same office. The Manifesto doesn’t say anything about co-located or distributed teams. It’s obvious that in modern software projects, virtual communications (over video calls) are way more effective than staying together in the same country, same city, same office, and same room. Therefore, most Agile adepts still promote on-site development style, using Agile Manifesto as proof. That’s a mistake; face-to-face means something totally different from what it meant 15 years ago, when the Manifesto was written.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Principle #7&lt;/strong&gt;: “Working software is the primary measure of progress.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This doesn’t mean that we should not measure anything else. Of course, the working software is the &lt;em&gt;primary&lt;/em&gt; measure, but there are many other measures, which we can and must use. For example, the amount of features documented, implemented and delivered; or the amount of lines of code added to the project (don’t smile, &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/11/14/hits-of-code.html&quot;&gt;read&lt;/a&gt;); or the amount of &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/09/10/testing-exit-criteria.html&quot;&gt;bugs found&lt;/a&gt;; or the amounts of &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/01/19/how-expensive-is-outsourcing.html&quot;&gt;dollars spent&lt;/a&gt;. There are many other metrics. We can use many of them. However, a typical mistake many Agile teams are doing is just ignoring them all. They say “we measure only the end result.” That’s not what the Manifesto is suggesting to do though.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Principle #8&lt;/strong&gt;: “Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;We must remember that any project is first of all a money burning machine.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;This doesn’t mean that we should indefinitely &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/06/02/how-to-estimate-software-cost.html&quot;&gt;burn&lt;/a&gt; customers’ money. Yes, we should be developing at some given speed, but we should always remember whose money we’re spending—customers’ money. The Manifesto doesn’t say anything about the cost of development and that’s probably because it was written by those who make money (programmers), not those who spend it (customers). We must therefore remember that any project is first of all a money burning machine. That’s why the team must always measure its &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/01/19/how-expensive-is-outsourcing.html&quot;&gt;burn rate&lt;/a&gt; and make sure it’s aligned with the amount of business value the team delivers. Just being a &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/03/02/team-morale-myths-and-reality.html&quot;&gt;happy team&lt;/a&gt; is not what the Manifesto suggests, but that’s exactly how many understand this principle.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Principle #9&lt;/strong&gt;: “Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That’s a perfect principle that says so much and doesn’t say anything at the same time. What exactly is “attention?” I can explain. It means &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/10/13/competition-without-rules.html&quot;&gt;rules and policies&lt;/a&gt;. First of all, any policy means &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/01/05/how-to-punish-employees.html&quot;&gt;punishment&lt;/a&gt; to those who violate rules. Thus, if an Agile team really means continuous attention to technical excellence, it must have a &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/08/13/strict-code-quality-control.html&quot;&gt;quality policy&lt;/a&gt;. That policy must clearly define which design is good and which is bad, which piece of Java code is excellent, which is ugly, etc. Additionally, the policy must say what happens to those who &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/11/24/imprisonment-for-irresponsible-coding.html&quot;&gt;violate&lt;/a&gt; the principles of excellence. However, most Agile teams understand “quality” as a great flag to hang on the wall, but get scared when I ask, “what happens if someone delivers low quality?.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Principle #10&lt;/strong&gt;: “Simplicity—the art of maximizing the amount of work not done—is essential.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That’s a great rule which most Agile teams don’t follow at all. This principle means that our tasks are small and simple enough to make sure they are either doable or cancellable. Huge tasks are the biggest threat to manageability of any team, be it Agile or not. This principle encourages us to give programmers small tasks, which they can easily be completed. However, most of Agile adepts simplicity being equal to stupidity. They are not equal. A simple task doesn’t mean a stupid or non-important tasks. A simple task is a clearly defined, small, and doable work order.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Principle #11&lt;/strong&gt;: “The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Self-organized doesn't mean un-organized.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;Self-organized doesn’t mean un-organized. This rule is often translated as a legalization of &lt;em&gt;anarchy&lt;/em&gt;. We don’t need any project managers, processes, discipline, rules, or policies—we’ve got &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/02/18/holacracy-autocracy.html&quot;&gt;holacracy&lt;/a&gt; instead! We also don’t need a software architect—our programmers can make all technical decisions at regular &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/07/13/meetings-are-legalized-robbery.html&quot;&gt;meetings&lt;/a&gt;! Furthermore, we don’t want our programmers to be individually responsible for anything—they are always together in all risks and issues. Stop that nonsense! This is not what the Manifesto means. A self-organizing team is a team that doesn’t need any supervision from the outside; a team that has clearly defined roles from the inside; a team with a perfect inner discipline; a team with professional &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/05/24/who-is-project-manager.html&quot;&gt;management&lt;/a&gt;. Not with the lack of all that.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Principle #12&lt;/strong&gt;: “At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That’s a great principle which is translated into so-called retrospective meetings. They work just fine as long as decisions make the team better. Unfortunately, in most cases, programmers in Agile teams are trying to &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/10/06/how-to-be-good-office-slave.html&quot;&gt;survive&lt;/a&gt;, instead of making their teams more effective. Even though the principle says that the team has to become more effective, those retrospective meetings help programmers to become more effective (read “more secure”) in the team. That’s only natural for people, but leads to the overall degradation of the team. It’s well known that the best team is the one that is capable of quickly and inevitably &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/09/16/how-to-fire-someone-right.html&quot;&gt;rejecting&lt;/a&gt; bad elements. Does your team do that effectively? Do retrospective meetings help in that? I doubt it. Therefore, I believe that what the Manifesto means here is not the meetings. It means that the team must have an effective mechanism of self-regulation and self-improvement. Additionally, retrospective meetings simply can’t be that mechanism because they prevent the team from making difficult disciplinary decisions.&lt;/p&gt; "/> <meta name="twitter:url" property="og:url" content="https://www.yegor256.com/2016/07/11/mistakes-in-agile-manifesto.html"/> <meta name="telegram:channel" content="AAAAAEJFMRzsRTRxM3ec6A"/> <link rel="search" type="application/opensearchdescription+xml" href="/opensearch.xml" title="yegor256" /> <link rel="shortcut icon" href="/favicon.ico?c998b88f617"/> <link rel="apple-touch-icon" href="/favicon.ico?c998b88f617"/> <link rel="alternate" type="application/rss+xml" title="RSS for yegor256.com" href="https://www.yegor256.com/rss.xml"/> <link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/layout.css?c998b88f617"/> <link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/icons.css?c998b88f617"/> <link rel="canonical" href="https://www.yegor256.com/2016/07/11/mistakes-in-agile-manifesto.html" /> <link rel="amphtml" href="https://www.yegor256.com/2016/07/11/mistakes-in-agile-manifesto.amp.html" /> <title>Twelve Mistakes in Agile Manifesto </title> <meta name='og:image' content='https://www.yegor256.com/images/2016/07/hail-caesar.jpg'/><meta name='twitter:image' content='https://www.yegor256.com/images/2016/07/hail-caesar.jpg'/><meta name='og:image:width' content='1200'/> <meta name='twitter:image:width' content='1200'/><meta name='og:image:height' content='655'/> <meta name='twitter:image:height' content='655'/><meta name='twitter:card' content='summary_large_image'/><meta name='twitter:image:alt' content='Hail, Caesar!

href="http://www.agilemanifesto.org/">Agile Manifesto</a> is a Bible of numerous software teams. It contains <a href="http://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html">12 principles</a> which show us how software development should be organized. These principles were invented in 2001. Generally, I like and agree with all of them. However, in practice, most software teams misunderstand them. Consequently, here is a summary of what’s going on and my interpretation of each principle.</p><figure class="jb_picture"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hail, Caesar!

(2016) by Coen Brothers</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Principle #1</strong>: “Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.”</p><aside class="quote">If the customer is not satisfied, we find another customer.</aside><p>By focusing on “satisfy the customer,” Agile adepts totally forget about the “through” part. They think that a <a href="/2015/01/26/happy-boss-false-objective.html">happy customer</a> is their true objective, while “continuous delivery” is something that obviously helps, though not crucially. However, this is quite the opposite—the customer will be satisfied <em>if</em> the software is perfectly created and delivered. If the customer is not satisfied, we find another customer—that’s the true spirit a professional software team should adhere to. I believe that’s what the Manifesto means. We make sure that our process is “early and continuous,” which will result to customer satisfaction. We focus on improving our process, not satisfying the customer. Satisfaction is the consequence, not the primary objective.</p><p><strong>Principle #2</strong>: “Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer’s competitive advantage.”</p><p>Most Agile teams understand the word “welcome” here as a permission to forget about any <a href="/2015/11/10/ten-mistakes-in-specs.html">requirements</a> management at all. What is the easiest way to welcome change? Obviously, just get rid of any requirement documents! In this case, any change will be welcome, since it won’t affect anything. There simply won’t be anything to affect. But this is not what the Manifesto means! This principle means that our requirements management process is so <em>powerful</em> that it can accept change at any moment. However, it’s rather difficult to achieve, if requirements are actually documented.</p><aside class="youtube"> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZoJ3gO4PSo"><div class="box"> <img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/sZoJ3gO4PSo/mqdefault.jpg" alt="YouTube video #sZoJ3gO4PSo" /><div class="play"><i class="icon icon-play"></i></div></div></a><div>Who Manages Who?

However, most Agile teams understand “quality” as a great flag to hang on the wall, but get scared when I ask, “what happens if someone delivers low quality?.”</p><p><strong>Principle #10</strong>: “Simplicity—the art of maximizing the amount of work not done—is essential.”</p><p>That’s a great rule which most Agile teams don’t follow at all. This principle means that our tasks are small and simple enough to make sure they are either doable or cancellable. Huge tasks are the biggest threat to manageability of any team, be it Agile or not. This principle encourages us to give programmers small tasks, which they can easily be completed. However, most of Agile adepts simplicity being equal to stupidity. They are not equal. A simple task doesn’t mean a stupid or non-important tasks. A simple task is a clearly defined, small, and doable work order.</p><p><strong>Principle #11</strong>: “The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.”</p><aside class="quote">Self-organized doesn't mean un-organized.</aside><p>Self-organized doesn’t mean un-organized.

Even though the principle says that the team has to become more effective, those retrospective meetings help programmers to become more effective (read “more secure”) in the team. That’s only natural for people, but leads to the overall degradation of the team. It’s well known that the best team is the one that is capable of quickly and inevitably <a href="/2015/09/16/how-to-fire-someone-right.html">rejecting</a> bad elements. Does your team do that effectively? Do retrospective meetings help in that? I doubt it. Therefore, I believe that what the Manifesto means here is not the meetings. It means that the team must have an effective mechanism of self-regulation and self-improvement. Additionally, retrospective meetings simply can’t be that mechanism because they prevent the team from making difficult disciplinary decisions.</p></p><nav class="buttons notranslate desktop-only"> <a href="http://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://www.yegor256.com/2016/07/11/mistakes-in-agile-manifesto.html" title="Share on Facebook" class="button" rel="nofollow"> <span class="count count-facebook">0</span> <i class="icon icon-facebook notranslate" aria-hidden="true"></i> </a> <a href="https://twitter.com/share?url=https://www.yegor256.com/2016/07/11/mistakes-in-agile-manifesto.html&amp;text=Twelve+Mistakes+in+Agile+Manifesto" title="Share on Twitter" class="button" rel="nofollow"> <span class="count count-twitter">0</span> <i class="icon icon-twitter notranslate" aria-hidden="true"></i> </a> <a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=https://www.yegor256.com/2016/07/11/mistakes-in-agile-manifesto.html" title="Share on Google+" class="button" rel="nofollow"> <span class="count count-googleplus">0</span> <i class="icon icon-googleplus notranslate" aria-hidden="true"></i> </a> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/cws/share?url=https://www.yegor256.com/2016/07/11/mistakes-in-agile-manifesto.html" title="Share on LinkedIn" class="button" rel="nofollow"> <span class="count count-linkedin">0</span> <i class="icon icon-linkedin notranslate" aria-hidden="true"></i> </a> <a href="http://reddit.com/submit?url=https://www.yegor256.com/2016/07/11/mistakes-in-agile-manifesto.html%3F2016-28&amp;title=Twelve+Mistakes+in+Agile+Manifesto" title="Share on Reddit" class="button" rel="nofollow"> <span class="count count-reddit">0</span> <i class="icon icon-reddit notranslate" aria-hidden="true"></i> </a> <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/submitlink?u=https://www.yegor256.com/2016/07/11/mistakes-in-agile-manifesto.html%3F2016-28&amp;t=Twelve+Mistakes+in+Agile+Manifesto" title="Share on Hacker News" class="button" rel="nofollow"> <span class="count count-hackernews">0</span> <i class="icon icon-hackernews notranslate" aria-hidden="true"></i> </a> </nav> </header> <article class="main" itemprop="articleBody"><div ><p>Nowadays, <a href="http://www.agilemanifesto.org/">Agile Manifesto</a> is a Bible of numerous software teams. It contains <a href="http://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html">12 principles</a> which show us how software development should be organized. These principles were invented in 2001. Generally, I like and agree with all of them. However, in practice, most software teams misunderstand them. Consequently, here is a summary of what’s going on and my interpretation of each principle.</p><figure class="jb_picture"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hail, Caesar! (2016) by Coen Brothers" src="/images/2016/07/hail-caesar.jpg" longdesc="#85dd1a6a" /><figcaption id="85dd1a6a">Hail, Caesar! (2016) by Coen Brothers</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Principle #1</strong>: “Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.”</p><aside class="quote">If the customer is not satisfied, we find another customer.</aside><p>By focusing on “satisfy the customer,” Agile adepts totally forget about the “through” part. They think that a <a href="/2015/01/26/happy-boss-false-objective.html">happy customer</a> is their true objective, while “continuous delivery” is something that obviously helps, though not crucially. However, this is quite the opposite—the customer will be satisfied <em>if</em> the software is perfectly created and delivered. If the customer is not satisfied, we find another customer—that’s the true spirit a professional software team should adhere to. I believe that’s what the Manifesto means. We make sure that our process is “early and continuous,” which will result to customer satisfaction. We focus on improving our process, not satisfying the customer. Satisfaction is the consequence, not the primary objective.</p><p><strong>Principle #2</strong>: “Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer’s competitive advantage.”</p><p>Most Agile teams understand the word “welcome” here as a permission to forget about any <a href="/2015/11/10/ten-mistakes-in-specs.html">requirements</a> management at all. What is the easiest way to welcome change? Obviously, just get rid of any requirement documents! In this case, any change will be welcome, since it won’t affect anything. There simply won’t be anything to affect. But this is not what the Manifesto means! This principle means that our requirements management process is so <em>powerful</em> that it can accept change at any moment. However, it’s rather difficult to achieve, if requirements are actually documented.</p><aside class="youtube"> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZoJ3gO4PSo"><div class="box"> <img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/sZoJ3gO4PSo/mqdefault.jpg" alt="YouTube video #sZoJ3gO4PSo" /><div class="play"><i class="icon icon-play"></i></div></div></a><div>Who Manages Who? (in Russian with English subtitles); 5 June 2016.</div></aside><p><strong>Principle #3</strong>: “Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.”</p><p>This terrific rule is usually understood as an order for the entire team. The team has to frequently deliver, while programmers are free to deliver almost nothing and who knows when. I think the Manifesto here is emphasizing on both individual and group responsibilities to frequently deliver. I also think that this frequency should be way higher than just a “couple of weeks.” Today, with modern technologies and instruments, we can deliver way faster—several times a day.</p><p><strong>Principle #4</strong>: “Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.”</p><aside class="quote">Working together means quicker turnarounds in communication not lack or roles and responsibilities.</aside><p>Working together doesn’t mean working without clearly defined rules and processes. However, most teams understand this principle as a legalization of chaos. They think that since we work together, we don’t need to define roles any more, we should not document <a href="/2015/11/10/ten-mistakes-in-specs.html">requirements</a>, we shouldn’t care about responsibilities. Ultimately in the end, we neither know who is doing what nor the team’s structure. That’s not what the Manifesto is talking about! “Working together” means quicker turnarounds in communication and shorter response cycles. It definitely doesn’t mean lack of roles and responsibilities.</p><p><strong>Principle #5</strong>: “Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.”</p><aside class="quote">Trust doesn't mean lack of control.</aside><p>Trust is a great word and concept, but it doesn’t replace another equally great word—control. Most Agile teams think that trust means exactly that—complete lack of any validation, verification, responsibility, and control. “We trust our programmers to write perfect codes”—I’ve heard that countless times which is simply wrong. This principle means something completely different. It means that when clearly defined tasks are assigned to their performers, we fully delegate responsibilities to them. We <a href="/2014/09/24/why-monetary-awards-dont-work.html">motivate</a> them to be fully responsible for the end result. However, we <a href="/2015/02/16/it-is-not-a-school.html">don’t help</a> them. Instead, we trust them as self-sufficient individuals, capable of completing assigned tasks on their own.</p><p><strong>Principle #6</strong>: “The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.”</p><aside class="quote">Face-to-face doesn't mean at the same office, especially now.</aside><p>Face-to-face doesn’t mean sitting in the same office. The Manifesto doesn’t say anything about co-located or distributed teams. It’s obvious that in modern software projects, virtual communications (over video calls) are way more effective than staying together in the same country, same city, same office, and same room. Therefore, most Agile adepts still promote on-site development style, using Agile Manifesto as proof. That’s a mistake; face-to-face means something totally different from what it meant 15 years ago, when the Manifesto was written.</p><p><strong>Principle #7</strong>: “Working software is the primary measure of progress.”</p><p>This doesn’t mean that we should not measure anything else. Of course, the working software is the <em>primary</em> measure, but there are many other measures, which we can and must use. For example, the amount of features documented, implemented and delivered; or the amount of lines of code added to the project (don’t smile, <a href="/2014/11/14/hits-of-code.html">read</a>); or the amount of <a href="/2015/09/10/testing-exit-criteria.html">bugs found</a>; or the amounts of <a href="/2016/01/19/how-expensive-is-outsourcing.html">dollars spent</a>. There are many other metrics. We can use many of them. However, a typical mistake many Agile teams are doing is just ignoring them all. They say “we measure only the end result.” That’s not what the Manifesto is suggesting to do though.</p><p><strong>Principle #8</strong>: “Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.”</p><aside class="quote">We must remember that any project is first of all a money burning machine.</aside><p>This doesn’t mean that we should indefinitely <a href="/2015/06/02/how-to-estimate-software-cost.html">burn</a> customers’ money. Yes, we should be developing at some given speed, but we should always remember whose money we’re spending—customers’ money. The Manifesto doesn’t say anything about the cost of development and that’s probably because it was written by those who make money (programmers), not those who spend it (customers). We must therefore remember that any project is first of all a money burning machine. That’s why the team must always measure its <a href="/2016/01/19/how-expensive-is-outsourcing.html">burn rate</a> and make sure it’s aligned with the amount of business value the team delivers. Just being a <a href="/2015/03/02/team-morale-myths-and-reality.html">happy team</a> is not what the Manifesto suggests, but that’s exactly how many understand this principle.</p><p><strong>Principle #9</strong>: “Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.”</p><p>That’s a perfect principle that says so much and doesn’t say anything at the same time. What exactly is “attention?” I can explain. It means <a href="/2015/10/13/competition-without-rules.html">rules and policies</a>. First of all, any policy means <a href="/2016/01/05/how-to-punish-employees.html">punishment</a> to those who violate rules. Thus, if an Agile team really means continuous attention to technical excellence, it must have a <a href="/2014/08/13/strict-code-quality-control.html">quality policy</a>. That policy must clearly define which design is good and which is bad, which piece of Java code is excellent, which is ugly, etc. Additionally, the policy must say what happens to those who <a href="/2015/11/24/imprisonment-for-irresponsible-coding.html">violate</a> the principles of excellence. However, most Agile teams understand “quality” as a great flag to hang on the wall, but get scared when I ask, “what happens if someone delivers low quality?.”</p><p><strong>Principle #10</strong>: “Simplicity—the art of maximizing the amount of work not done—is essential.”</p><p>That’s a great rule which most Agile teams don’t follow at all.

I do, of course; there are many of them, but the list below succinctly summarizes the most important ones.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;!--more--&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;jb_picture&quot;&gt;&lt;img itemprop=&quot;image&quot; alt=&quot;Don&amp;#39;t Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood (1996) by Paris Barclay&quot; src=&quot;/images/2016/06/dont-be-a-menace-to-south-central-while-drinking-your-juice-in-the-hood.jpg&quot; longdesc=&quot;#b00247d7&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption id=&quot;b00247d7&quot;&gt;Don&amp;#39;t Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood (1996) by Paris Barclay&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;I’ll be referring to “him,” but these recommendations apply equally to both female and male &lt;del&gt;slaves&lt;/del&gt; software developers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ask a Friend&lt;/strong&gt;. The best way to find talent is through a reference. Who knows the software market better than your high school classmate who bought a WordPress website last year, right? He will definitely recommend a good programmer to you. Recommendations are the most effective way of finding contractors. First, you don’t need to worry about screening and testing. Second, you’ll have a very good explanation for why your project failed—because your friend let you down with a bad recommendation. Win-win.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Hire only locals---they are much easier to manage and punish.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hire Only Locals&lt;/strong&gt;. Don’t even think about a remote programmer—remote projects always fail. &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/10/27/outsourcing-doesnt-work.html&quot;&gt;Always&lt;/a&gt;. He will work in a different time zone, you will always have cultural clashes, and his Russian accent will be annoying. You simply won’t be able to meet him every second day and &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/05/21/avoid-software-outsourcing-disaster.html&quot;&gt;whine&lt;/a&gt; about your project being too expensive, too slow, and too frustrating. Hire only locals—they are much easier to manage and &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/01/05/how-to-punish-employees.html&quot;&gt;punish&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t Offend With a Lack of Trust&lt;/strong&gt;. A talented professional programmer will be offended if you ask him to pass a test or prove some of his skills. That will demonstrate that you don’t trust him. And if you don’t trust him, you simply should not work together. Trust is the most important thing in any project. Also, don’t ask how certain things will be done. He is the professional you’re hiring, and he knows what he is doing. That’s enough.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fall in Love&lt;/strong&gt;. After trust, the most important thing is a personal connection between you two. I’m not saying you must fall in love with your programmer, but it won’t hurt. You should feel an emotional touch with him. Otherwise Java code won’t work like you need it to. If you can’t fall in love, you should at least become good friends. Invite him to your home parties, go to movies together, and introduce him to your wife. All of this will seriously affect the quality of the product he is creating.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t Specify Too Much&lt;/strong&gt;. That’s what &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/07/11/mistakes-in-agile-manifesto.html&quot;&gt;Agile&lt;/a&gt; recommends, and I second that—face-to-face communication is more valuable than documentation. Don’t write any documentation, don’t specify what exactly you need to develop, and don’t think too much about your “user stories.” It’s all in the past. Modern software engineers figure everything out by themselves. Just let him be creative and communicative. If something isn’t clear, just call him. Remember, a Skype call is &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/10/07/stop-chatting-start-coding.html&quot;&gt;always better&lt;/a&gt; than those boring documents that nobody knows how to write.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Motivate by Value&lt;/strong&gt;. In order to create a great software product, he must be very &lt;em&gt;excited&lt;/em&gt; about it. Make sure he is excited. If he is not excited, call him again. Motivate him. Talk to him. Explain to him your brilliant Google-killer business idea again and again. Until the moment he &lt;del&gt;screams&lt;/del&gt; says “I’m excited.” He must know what a great value your product is producing for the entirety of civilization. And he must be excited. Do I have to say it one more time? Excited! Are you excited already? I’m excited.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Promise Job Security&lt;/strong&gt;. Even if you just raised $2K for your startup from your wife’s step-dad, promise your programmer a cloudless financial future. He must know that you’ve got enough to pay him until he retires. A good programmer must want to work with you forever. That’s the type of programmer you need. You don’t want one of those greedy freelancers who always jumps from project to project. You need a long-term commitment. That’s why you have to pretend you’re rich enough.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Programmers in general are not really good in financial negotiations; use that to exploit them.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Delay Money Talks&lt;/strong&gt;. Don’t mention money for as long as you can. Ideally, ask him to create a prototype first and “then we’ll discuss your salary.” A good programmer doesn’t work for money. He works for satisfaction. That’s who you need. You should discuss value, excitement, features, market disruption, and anything else that’s important, but not money. Programmers in general are not really good in financial negotiations. Use that to exploit him for as much as you can.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t Negotiate&lt;/strong&gt;. Eventually you will have to discuss money. Make sure there will be no negotiation involved. It’ll be an offensive process, and most programmers are very sensitive. Just tell him how much you will pay, and if he doesn’t feel that is enough, get back to the value/excitement/market conversation. Do it again and again until he agrees.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Require Full Commitment&lt;/strong&gt;. Make sure he will be fully committed to the project. Ideally, he must not have any other projects or even any personal life at all. He must promise to be 100 percent with you and your idea. If he is planning on doing something else, demonstrate that it will offend you. Act jealous, like a loving wife. You don’t need a programmer who is interested in something else.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;You're going to be his leader, and a good leader is never too honest with subordinates.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make Him a Partner&lt;/strong&gt;. First of all, making him a partner will save you a lot of money. Ideally, you should convince him to work &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/10/29/how-much-do-you-cost.html&quot;&gt;for free&lt;/a&gt;. Good programmers are good entrepreneurs and like to take risks. A good programmer knows that in order to become the next Mark Zuckerberg, he must start at a job with no salary. Give him some &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/01/12/good-programmers-dont-work-for-equity.html&quot;&gt;equity&lt;/a&gt; and keep those motivational speeches coming. It’s a perfect money-saving technique.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be Positive&lt;/strong&gt;. Simply don’t tell him about your risks and concerns. The future of your project is bright, and he doesn’t need to know more. You’re going to be his &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/05/24/who-is-project-manager.html&quot;&gt;leader&lt;/a&gt;, and a good leader is never too honest with subordinates. Always be positive about the plan—he needs to get that from you.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;hr /&gt; &lt;p&gt;That should be enough to find and hire a good programmer. Interestingly enough, I just re-read this text one last time and it looks to me like a “how to find a wife” tutorial. Don’t you think? Anyway, did I forget anything?

Where and how do you find and hire a good programmer? Since I’m a programmer and I <a href="http://www.teamed.io">manage</a> software projects, I’m supposed to know the tricks. I do, of course; there are many of them, but the list below succinctly summarizes the most important ones.</p><figure class="jb_picture"><img itemprop="image" alt="Don&#39;t Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood (1996) by Paris Barclay" src="/images/2016/06/dont-be-a-menace-to-south-central-while-drinking-your-juice-in-the-hood.jpg" longdesc="#b00247d7" /><figcaption id="b00247d7">Don&#39;t Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood (1996) by Paris Barclay</figcaption></figure><p>I’ll be referring to “him,” but these recommendations apply equally to both female and male <del>slaves</del> software developers.</p><p><strong>Ask a Friend</strong>. The best way to find talent is through a reference. Who knows the software market better than your high school classmate who bought a WordPress website last year, right? He will definitely recommend a good programmer to you. Recommendations are the most effective way of finding contractors. First, you don’t need to worry about screening and testing. Second, you’ll have a very good explanation for why your project failed—because your friend let you down with a bad recommendation. Win-win.</p><aside class="quote">Hire only locals---they are much easier to manage and punish.</aside><p><strong>Hire Only Locals</strong>. Don’t even think about a remote programmer—remote projects always fail. <a href="/2015/10/27/outsourcing-doesnt-work.html">Always</a>. He will work in a different time zone, you will always have cultural clashes, and his Russian accent will be annoying. You simply won’t be able to meet him every second day and <a href="/2015/05/21/avoid-software-outsourcing-disaster.html">whine</a> about your project being too expensive, too slow, and too frustrating. Hire only locals—they are much easier to manage and <a href="/2016/01/05/how-to-punish-employees.html">punish</a>.</p><p><strong>Don’t Offend With a Lack of Trust</strong>. A talented professional programmer will be offended if you ask him to pass a test or prove some of his skills. That will demonstrate that you don’t trust him. And if you don’t trust him, you simply should not work together. Trust is the most important thing in any project. Also, don’t ask how certain things will be done. He is the professional you’re hiring, and he knows what he is doing. That’s enough.</p><p><strong>Fall in Love</strong>. After trust, the most important thing is a personal connection between you two. I’m not saying you must fall in love with your programmer, but it won’t hurt. You should feel an emotional touch with him. Otherwise Java code won’t work like you need it to. If you can’t fall in love, you should at least become good friends. Invite him to your home parties, go to movies together, and introduce him to your wife. All of this will seriously affect the quality of the product he is creating.</p><p><strong>Don’t Specify Too Much</strong>. That’s what <a href="/2016/07/11/mistakes-in-agile-manifesto.html">Agile</a> recommends, and I second that—face-to-face communication is more valuable than documentation. Don’t write any documentation, don’t specify what exactly you need to develop, and don’t think too much about your “user stories.” It’s all in the past. Modern software engineers figure everything out by themselves. Just let him be creative and communicative. If something isn’t clear, just call him. Remember, a Skype call is <a href="/2014/10/07/stop-chatting-start-coding.html">always better</a> than those boring documents that nobody knows how to write.</p><p><strong>Motivate by Value</strong>. In order to create a great software product, he must be very <em>excited</em> about it. Make sure he is excited. If he is not excited, call him again. Motivate him. Talk to him. Explain to him your brilliant Google-killer business idea again and again. Until the moment he <del>screams</del> says “I’m excited.” He must know what a great value your product is producing for the entirety of civilization. And he must be excited. Do I have to say it one more time? Excited! Are you excited already? I’m excited.</p><p><strong>Promise Job Security</strong>. Even if you just raised $2K for your startup from your wife’s step-dad, promise your programmer a cloudless financial future. He must know that you’ve got enough to pay him until he retires. A good programmer must want to work with you forever. That’s the type of programmer you need. You don’t want one of those greedy freelancers who always jumps from project to project. You need a long-term commitment. That’s why you have to pretend you’re rich enough.</p><aside class="quote">Programmers in general are not really good in financial negotiations; use that to exploit them.</aside><p><strong>Delay Money Talks</strong>. Don’t mention money for as long as you can. Ideally, ask him to create a prototype first and “then we’ll discuss your salary.” A good programmer doesn’t work for money. He works for satisfaction. That’s who you need. You should discuss value, excitement, features, market disruption, and anything else that’s important, but not money. Programmers in general are not really good in financial negotiations. Use that to exploit him for as much as you can.</p><p><strong>Don’t Negotiate</strong>. Eventually you will have to discuss money. Make sure there will be no negotiation involved. It’ll be an offensive process, and most programmers are very sensitive. Just tell him how much you will pay, and if he doesn’t feel that is enough, get back to the value/excitement/market conversation. Do it again and again until he agrees.</p><p><strong>Require Full Commitment</strong>. Make sure he will be fully committed to the project. Ideally, he must not have any other projects or even any personal life at all. He must promise to be 100 percent with you and your idea. If he is planning on doing something else, demonstrate that it will offend you. Act jealous, like a loving wife. You don’t need a programmer who is interested in something else.</p><aside class="quote">You're going to be his leader, and a good leader is never too honest with subordinates.</aside><p><strong>Make Him a Partner</strong>. First of all, making him a partner will save you a lot of money. Ideally, you should convince him to work <a href="/2014/10/29/how-much-do-you-cost.html">for free</a>. Good programmers are good entrepreneurs and like to take risks. A good programmer knows that in order to become the next Mark Zuckerberg, he must start at a job with no salary. Give him some <a href="/2016/01/12/good-programmers-dont-work-for-equity.html">equity</a> and keep those motivational speeches coming. It’s a perfect money-saving technique.</p><p><strong>Be Positive</strong>. Simply don’t tell him about your risks and concerns. The future of your project is bright, and he doesn’t need to know more. You’re going to be his <a href="/2016/05/24/who-is-project-manager.html">leader</a>, and a good leader is never too honest with subordinates. Always be positive about the plan—he needs to get that from you.</p><hr /><p>That should be enough to find and hire a good programmer. Interestingly enough, I just re-read this text one last time and it looks to me like a “how to find a wife” tutorial. Don’t you think? Anyway, did I forget anything? Don’t hesitate to post some extra wisdom below in the comments section.</p></p><nav class="buttons notranslate desktop-only"> <a href="http://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://www.yegor256.com/2016/06/21/how-to-hire-programmer.html" title="Share on Facebook" class="button" rel="nofollow"> <span class="count count-facebook">0</span> <i class="icon icon-facebook notranslate" aria-hidden="true"></i> </a> <a href="https://twitter.com/share?url=https://www.yegor256.com/2016/06/21/how-to-hire-programmer.html&amp;text=How+to+Hire+a+Programmer" title="Share on Twitter" class="button" rel="nofollow"> <span class="count count-twitter">0</span> <i class="icon icon-twitter notranslate" aria-hidden="true"></i> </a> <a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=https://www.yegor256.com/2016/06/21/how-to-hire-programmer.html" title="Share on Google+" class="button" rel="nofollow"> <span class="count count-googleplus">0</span> <i class="icon icon-googleplus notranslate" aria-hidden="true"></i> </a> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/cws/share?url=https://www.yegor256.com/2016/06/21/how-to-hire-programmer.html" title="Share on LinkedIn" class="button" rel="nofollow"> <span class="count count-linkedin">0</span> <i class="icon icon-linkedin notranslate" aria-hidden="true"></i> </a> <a href="http://reddit.com/submit?url=https://www.yegor256.com/2016/06/21/how-to-hire-programmer.html%3F2016-25&amp;title=How+to+Hire+a+Programmer" title="Share on Reddit" class="button" rel="nofollow"> <span class="count count-reddit">0</span> <i class="icon icon-reddit notranslate" aria-hidden="true"></i> </a> <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/submitlink?u=https://www.yegor256.com/2016/06/21/how-to-hire-programmer.html%3F2016-25&amp;t=How+to+Hire+a+Programmer" title="Share on Hacker News" class="button" rel="nofollow"> <span class="count count-hackernews">0</span> <i class="icon icon-hackernews notranslate" aria-hidden="true"></i> </a> </nav> </header> <article class="main" itemprop="articleBody"><div ><p>I get asked this question very often: Where and how do you find and hire a good programmer?

When you woke up, the world was in &lt;i&gt;W&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt; state. There were some coffee beans in the bag, some water in the tap and some electricity in the power station. And there were you standing in front of the coffee machine. These were the &lt;em&gt;resources&lt;/em&gt; (including yourself). There were also &lt;strong&gt;risks&lt;/strong&gt;. The electricity black out could have happened, right? The machine could have broken, right? In theory, there was an unlimited amount of risks, including a zombie riot. However, the majority of them had very low &lt;em&gt;probabilities&lt;/em&gt;, that’s why you managed to make that cup of coffee.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When the coffee was ready, the world appeared to be in &lt;i&gt;W&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt; state. There were no coffee beans in the bag any more, the water was used, and so was the electricity. However, a cup of coffee was created. We may call that project a &lt;strong&gt;success&lt;/strong&gt;, but that’s not really important and is not correct. What’s important is that it’s &lt;em&gt;finished&lt;/em&gt;. We successfully transformed the world from state &lt;i&gt;W&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt; to state &lt;i&gt;W&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt;. You may be surprised to hear that the project was not a success. Indeed, it was not. It was a success only for you, one of its &lt;em&gt;stakeholders&lt;/em&gt;. How about your roommate, the owner of that bag of coffee beans, who asked you yesterday not to use them because he was waiting for a date tonight? How much of a success was your project to &lt;em&gt;him&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;A project is never a success or a failure; it is either dead or alive, that's it.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;So, a project is never a “success” or a “failure.” A project is either &lt;em&gt;dead&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;alive&lt;/em&gt;, that’s it. Success is a subjective category and can only be measured per stakeholder. And even a small project has many stakeholders. Think about that electricity company who sold you a few kW/h and made some profit out of it? The project was definitely a success for them. What about &lt;strong&gt;mother nature&lt;/strong&gt;? Your project was definitely a failure for it, since you produced a few kilograms of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; while making that damn coffee. As you see, success is very subjective.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And we’re in line with the PMBOK definition. Our coffee making project was indeed a temporary endeavor undertaken to create a unique product, which was a cup of coffee.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Did we have a project manager? No. Were we doing any project management? No. Well, not &lt;em&gt;explicitly&lt;/em&gt;. Obviously, you were the project manager, but you didn’t realize that.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Project management&lt;/strong&gt; is a set of tools to &lt;em&gt;predict&lt;/em&gt; the outcome of a project. Planning is one of those tools. Guessing is another one. Expert judgment is yet another one, which you were using while making that coffee. You were an expert and knew how to use the machine, the electricity, and the water tap. You didn’t need any other tools except your &lt;strong&gt;expert judgment&lt;/strong&gt;. And it worked. In bigger projects, we would need more powerful instruments and methods. For example, we could use some scheduling software to plan when to put the beans into the machine, when to put that cup under the dipping point and when to press the button. You might also need a budgeting software to calculate how much money you will owe to the roommate. You might use a few risk identification and planning algorithms, etc.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;You must try to predict the future with as much accuracy and precision as possible.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;Most of such tools are mentioned and explained in the PMBOK. They are even grouped there into so called “knowledge areas:” for predicting time, money, risks, people, etc. It’s not important how exactly you predict the future, how many tools you’re using or what knowledge areas you break them into. What’s important is that you must try to do it with as much &lt;em&gt;accuracy&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;precision&lt;/em&gt; as possible. Here comes the definition of the main guy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;project manager&lt;/strong&gt; (PM) is the one who predicts the future. The PM knows in what state &lt;i&gt;W&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt; the world will be when the project is finished. If the PM doesn’t know or is in doubt—it’s a bad PM. If the PM knows and is certain about it—it’s a good PM. That’s it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And I have to say, in that coffee making project you were a lousy PM. Did you know what was the probability of the project being finished without a cup of coffee made? A good PM would say that “after an analysis of 230 risks I predict the probability of that coffee being tasteful as 87.4%.” Obviously, you didn’t have that &lt;strong&gt;information&lt;/strong&gt;. Next, did you know what would be the total monetary value of the project after its completion? Did you calculate all incurred costs, including the price of environmental damage your coffee machine made? A good PM would say that “the total cost of the project is expected to be $1.09.” Were you able to predict the duration of the project precisely? Well, maybe that one you were rather good at.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There is only one reason why we want to put a project manager on top of the project. I’m sure you will be surprised to hear it: the only purpose of a PM in a project is to help its key stakeholders (also known as sponsors) to make a &lt;strong&gt;decision&lt;/strong&gt;: to &lt;em&gt;kill&lt;/em&gt; the project right now or to let it stay &lt;em&gt;alive&lt;/em&gt; for a bit more. That’s it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Project sponsors need to know whether the project is worth going forward.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;You didn’t need a PM in your coffee making project because you, as its key stakeholder, were fully committed to finish it only when the coffee is ready. But imagine another situation. The coffee machine suddenly breaks, the water stops, the electricity is blacked out and some zombies are knocking at your door. And you still want that cup of coffee. Well, you’re not entirely sure what’s more important now, the coffee or simply finding a way to survive. You will need a more or less accurate &lt;strong&gt;prediction&lt;/strong&gt; of how much that coffee will cost you and when will it be ready. If it’s just a few minutes and everything will be fine again, you will keep waiting for it. However, if the prediction is five hours and a risk of failure rate is 93%, you had better terminate this project and do something else.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That’s exactly what is happening in software development projects and all other projects. Project sponsors need to &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; whether the project is worth going forward or it’s time to stop it and do something else. That’s what they hire project managers for. This is the only reason of that millions of PMs existence—to &lt;em&gt;predict&lt;/em&gt; the future so that we were able to kill our projects before they kill us (read “eat all our resources”).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You may ask—what about the &lt;strong&gt;coordinating&lt;/strong&gt; part? What about &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/01/08/morning-standup-meetings.html&quot;&gt;morning stand-ups&lt;/a&gt;? What about walking around the office and motivating all the &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/10/06/how-to-be-good-office-slave.html&quot;&gt;office slaves&lt;/a&gt; so that they don’t get lazy? Isn’t it the primary responsibility of a PM?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Not really. This is what a PM does in order to better understand the situation and predict the future. But it’s not what a PM is paid for. Indeed, a bad PM goes around the office and calls &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/07/13/meetings-are-legalized-robbery.html&quot;&gt;multiple meetings&lt;/a&gt; a day. This is also known as “staying on top of things”—a perfect term to define an amateur PM. A bad PM &lt;em&gt;becomes&lt;/em&gt; the future, instead of predicting it. He &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/09/22/micromanagement.html&quot;&gt;micromanages&lt;/a&gt; the team by telling everybody what to do, since this is the easiest way to know what will happen and when, in the short-term. But the long-term future stays absolutely unclear. A bad PM mostly relies on expert judgment, just like you did while making that coffee.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;A good PM finds a way to organize resources in such a way that their future becomes predictable.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;A good project manager is a completely different creature. A good PM finds a way to &lt;em&gt;organize&lt;/em&gt; resources in such a way that their future becomes &lt;em&gt;predictable&lt;/em&gt;. The key word here is “organize.” A good PM organizes people, money, time, risks, stakeholders, and many other things. He uses planning and budgeting software in order to better see the future. But he doesn’t become the future and he doesn’t &lt;em&gt;build&lt;/em&gt; the future. His people do that, he just &lt;em&gt;observes&lt;/em&gt;. He only collects information from many possible sources and estimates what will happen, how much it will cost and who will suffer most and least. At any moment in time, he &lt;em&gt;knows&lt;/em&gt; exactly when the project will be finished, how much it will spend, how many results it will produce, what the quality will be, and what the accuracy of that prediction is.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A good PM doesn’t personally give orders to the team and doesn’t meet people to tell them what to do. Instead, he makes sure that &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/08/23/communication-maturity.html&quot;&gt;all communication&lt;/a&gt; is happening through a &lt;strong&gt;project management information system&lt;/strong&gt; (PMIS). Moreover, in a perfectly organized project, a PM won’t even need to give any orders to the team. Work orders will be created, approved, assigned and verified by the team itself. The PM will make sure that the workflow is seamless and disciplined. But he won’t be personally responsible for telling people what to do.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A perfect PM won’t even be visible to the team. Everything will be &lt;strong&gt;obvious&lt;/strong&gt; and clear: plans will be available, work orders explicitly defined, risks identified and documented, concerns properly reported, stakeholders informed in time, etc. This may sound like utopia, but that’s the true meaning of a “project manager” role.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;A charismatic project manager will inevitably ruin the project.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;I believe it’s already obvious that project management has very little to do with leadership. They are just two &lt;em&gt;orthogonal&lt;/em&gt; skill sets. I would say that a perfect PM won’t even need any leadership skills, while a lousy PM will need a lot of them. As far as I understand, being a leader means having enough inner power (also known as “&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charisma&quot;&gt;charisma&lt;/a&gt;”) to make people do what you need. But that’s totally against what we just discussed. A project manager doesn’t want people do what’s needed because of his &lt;strong&gt;charisma&lt;/strong&gt;. Instead, he wants people to be leaders of their own tasks. They have to move forward driven by their own motivation and &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/09/24/why-monetary-awards-dont-work.html&quot;&gt;selfish interests&lt;/a&gt;, according to the plans and &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/10/13/competition-without-rules.html&quot;&gt;rules&lt;/a&gt; defined by the PM. A charismatic project manager will inevitably replace the rules by his or her own personality and the entire idea of project management will be ruined.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is my understanding of project management.&lt;/p&gt; " /> <meta name="keywords" content="next, path, output, content, previous, url, relative_path, id, collection, excerpt, draft, categories, layout, title, date, place, tags, description, keywords, image, jb_picture, slug, ext" /> <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1"/> <meta name="google-site-verification" content="JEj_gQr2CPe2QKGw8XdMz0R7VboQIUbX3FlM-lwTq-8" /> <meta name="author" content="Yegor Bugayenko"> <meta name="article:published_time" content="2016-05-24 00:00:00 +0000"> <meta name="og:site_name" content="Yegor Bugayenko"/> <meta name="og:type" content="article" /> <meta name="og:locale" content="en_US" /> <meta name="twitter:account_id" content="4503599630178231" /> <meta name="twitter:creator" content="@yegor256"/> <meta name="twitter:site" content="@yegor256"/> <meta name="twitter:title" property="og:title" content="Who Is a Project Manager?"/> <meta name="twitter:description" property="og:description" content="&lt;p&gt;A project manager is very often &lt;strong&gt;confused&lt;/strong&gt; with a leader.

And, in my opinion, a perfect project manager is much more valuable for a project than a leader.

Once they are clear, my previous statement will become obvious.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;project&lt;/strong&gt; is a vector from &lt;i&gt;W&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt; to &lt;i&gt;W&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, where &lt;i&gt;W&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt; is a set of all &lt;em&gt;resources and risks&lt;/em&gt; in the world at some defined point in time &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;W&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;em&gt;is the world&lt;/em&gt;, at the moment &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;. A project transforms the world, moving it from one state to another. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pmi.org/PMBOK-Guide-and-Standards.aspx&quot;&gt;PMBOK&lt;/a&gt; defines projects as “temporary endeavors undertaken to create unique products, services, or results,” which is just a specific case of my definition.

Everything will be &lt;strong&gt;obvious&lt;/strong&gt; and clear: plans will be available, work orders explicitly defined, risks identified and documented, concerns properly reported, stakeholders informed in time, etc. This may sound like utopia, but that’s the true meaning of a “project manager” role.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;A charismatic project manager will inevitably ruin the project.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;I believe it’s already obvious that project management has very little to do with leadership. They are just two &lt;em&gt;orthogonal&lt;/em&gt; skill sets. I would say that a perfect PM won’t even need any leadership skills, while a lousy PM will need a lot of them. As far as I understand, being a leader means having enough inner power (also known as “&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charisma&quot;&gt;charisma&lt;/a&gt;”) to make people do what you need. But that’s totally against what we just discussed. A project manager doesn’t want people do what’s needed because of his &lt;strong&gt;charisma&lt;/strong&gt;. Instead, he wants people to be leaders of their own tasks. They have to move forward driven by their own motivation and &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/09/24/why-monetary-awards-dont-work.html&quot;&gt;selfish interests&lt;/a&gt;, according to the plans and &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/10/13/competition-without-rules.html&quot;&gt;rules&lt;/a&gt; defined by the PM. A charismatic project manager will inevitably replace the rules by his or her own personality and the entire idea of project management will be ruined.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is my understanding of project management.&lt;/p&gt; "/> <meta name="twitter:url" property="og:url" content="https://www.yegor256.com/2016/05/24/who-is-project-manager.html"/> <meta name="telegram:channel"

(webinar #19); 7 December 2016.</div></aside><p>Consider this example. You woke up in the morning and made yourself a cup of coffee. That was a project. When you woke up, the world was in <i>W<sub>1</sub></i> state. There were some coffee beans in the bag, some water in the tap and some electricity in the power station. And there were you standing in front of the coffee machine. These were the <em>resources</em> (including yourself). There were also <strong>risks</strong>. The electricity black out could have happened, right? The machine could have broken, right? In theory, there was an unlimited amount of risks, including a zombie riot. However, the majority of them had very low <em>probabilities</em>, that’s why you managed to make that cup of coffee.</p><p>When the coffee was ready, the world appeared to be in <i>W<sub>2</sub></i> state. There were no coffee beans in the bag any more, the water was used, and so was the electricity. However, a cup of coffee was created. We may call that project a <strong>success</strong>, but that’s not really important and is not correct. What’s important is that it’s <em>finished</em>. We successfully transformed the world from state <i>W<sub>1</sub></i> to state <i>W<sub>2</sub></i>. You may be surprised to hear that the project was not a success. Indeed, it was not. It was a success only for you, one of its <em>stakeholders</em>. How about your roommate, the owner of that bag of coffee beans, who asked you yesterday not to use them because he was waiting for a date tonight? How much of a success was your project to <em>him</em>?</p><aside class="quote">A project is never a success or a failure; it is either dead or alive, that's it.</aside><p>So, a project is never a “success” or a “failure.” A project is either <em>dead</em> or <em>alive</em>, that’s it. Success is a subjective category and can only be measured per stakeholder. And even a small project has many stakeholders. Think about that electricity company who sold you a few kW/h and made some profit out of it? The project was definitely a success for them. What about <strong>mother nature</strong>? Your project was definitely a failure for it, since you produced a few kilograms of CO<sub>2</sub> while making that damn coffee. As you see, success is very subjective.</p><p>And we’re in line with the PMBOK definition. Our coffee making project was indeed a temporary endeavor undertaken to create a unique product, which was a cup of coffee.</p><p>Did we have a project manager? No. Were we doing any project management? No. Well, not <em>explicitly</em>. Obviously, you were the project manager, but you didn’t realize that.</p><p><strong>Project management</strong> is a set of tools to <em>predict</em> the outcome of a project. Planning is one of those tools. Guessing is another one. Expert judgment is yet another one, which you were using while making that coffee. You were an expert and knew how to use the machine, the electricity, and the water tap. You didn’t need any other tools except your <strong>expert judgment</strong>. And it worked. In bigger projects, we would need more powerful instruments and methods. For example, we could use some scheduling software to plan when to put the beans into the machine, when to put that cup under the dipping point and when to press the button. You might also need a budgeting software to calculate how much money you will owe to the roommate. You might use a few risk identification and planning algorithms, etc.</p><aside class="quote">You must try to predict the future with as much accuracy and precision as possible.</aside><p>Most of such tools are mentioned and explained in the PMBOK. They are even grouped there into so called “knowledge areas:” for predicting time, money, risks, people, etc. It’s not important how exactly you predict the future, how many tools you’re using or what knowledge areas you break them into. What’s important is that you must try to do it with as much <em>accuracy</em> and <em>precision</em> as possible. Here comes the definition of the main guy.</p><p>A <strong>project manager</strong> (PM) is the one who predicts the future. The PM knows in what state <i>W<sub>2</sub></i> the world will be when the project is finished. If the PM doesn’t know or is in doubt—it’s a bad PM. If the PM knows and is certain about it—it’s a good PM. That’s it.</p><p>And I have to say, in that coffee making project you were a lousy PM. Did you know what was the probability of the project being finished without a cup of coffee made? A good PM would say that “after an analysis of 230 risks I predict the probability of that coffee being tasteful as 87.4%.” Obviously, you didn’t have that <strong>information</strong>. Next, did you know what would be the total monetary value of the project after its completion? Did you calculate all incurred costs, including the price of environmental damage your coffee machine made? A good PM would say that “the total cost of the project is expected to be $1.09.” Were you able to predict the duration of the project precisely? Well, maybe that one you were rather good at.</p><p>There is only one reason why we want to put a project manager on top of the project. I’m sure you will be surprised to hear it: the only purpose of a PM in a project is to help its key stakeholders (also known as sponsors) to make a <strong>decision</strong>: to <em>kill</em> the project right now or to let it stay <em>alive</em> for a bit more. That’s it.</p><aside class="quote">Project sponsors need to know whether the project is worth going forward.</aside><p>You didn’t need a PM in your coffee making project because you, as its key stakeholder, were fully committed to finish it only when the coffee is ready. But imagine another situation. The coffee machine suddenly breaks, the water stops, the electricity is blacked out and some zombies are knocking at your door. And you still want that cup of coffee. Well, you’re not entirely sure what’s more important now, the coffee or simply finding a way to survive. You will need a more or less accurate <strong>prediction</strong> of how much that coffee will cost you and when will it be ready. If it’s just a few minutes and everything will be fine again, you will keep waiting for it. However, if the prediction is five hours and a risk of failure rate is 93%, you had better terminate this project and do something else.</p><p>That’s exactly what is happening in software development projects and all other projects. Project sponsors need to <em>know</em> whether the project is worth going forward or it’s time to stop it and do something else. That’s what they hire project managers for. This is the only reason of that millions of PMs existence—to <em>predict</em> the future so that we were able to kill our projects before they kill us (read “eat all our resources”).</p><p>You may ask—what about the <strong>coordinating</strong> part? What about <a href="/2015/01/08/morning-standup-meetings.html">morning stand-ups</a>? What about walking around the office and motivating all the <a href="/2015/10/06/how-to-be-good-office-slave.html">office slaves</a> so that they don’t get lazy? Isn’t it the primary responsibility of a PM?</p><p>Not really. This is what a PM does in order to better understand the situation and predict the future. But it’s not what a PM is paid for. Indeed, a bad PM goes around the office and calls <a href="/2015/07/13/meetings-are-legalized-robbery.html">multiple meetings</a> a day. This is also known as “staying on top of things”—a perfect term to define an amateur PM. A bad PM <em>becomes</em> the future, instead of predicting it. He <a href="/2015/09/22/micromanagement.html">micromanages</a> the team by telling everybody what to do, since this is the easiest way to know what will happen and when, in the short-term. But the long-term future stays absolutely unclear. A bad PM mostly relies on expert judgment, just like you did while making that coffee.</p><aside class="quote">A good PM finds a way to organize resources in such a way that their future becomes predictable.</aside><p>A good project manager is a completely different creature. A good PM finds a way to <em>organize</em> resources in such a way that their future becomes <em>predictable</em>. The key word here is “organize.” A good PM organizes people, money, time, risks, stakeholders, and many other things. He uses planning and budgeting software in order to better see the future. But he doesn’t become the future and he doesn’t <em>build</em> the future. His people do that, he just <em>observes</em>. He only collects information from many possible sources and estimates what will happen, how much it will cost and who will suffer most and least. At any moment in time, he <em>knows</em> exactly when the project will be finished, how much it will spend, how many results it will produce, what the quality will be, and what the accuracy of that prediction is.</p><p>A good PM doesn’t personally give orders to the team and doesn’t meet people to tell them what to do. Instead, he makes sure that <a href="/2016/08/23/communication-maturity.html">all communication</a> is happening through a <strong>project management information system</strong> (PMIS). Moreover, in a perfectly organized project, a PM won’t even need to give any orders to the team. Work orders will be created, approved, assigned and verified by the team itself. The PM will make sure that the workflow is seamless and disciplined. But he won’t be personally responsible for telling people what to do.</p><p>A perfect PM won’t even be visible to the team. Everything will be <strong>obvious</strong> and clear: plans will be available, work orders explicitly defined, risks identified and documented, concerns properly reported, stakeholders informed in time, etc. This may sound like utopia, but that’s the true meaning of a “project manager” role.</p><aside class="quote">A charismatic project manager will inevitably ruin the project.</aside><p>I believe it’s already obvious that project management has very little to do with leadership. They are just two <em>orthogonal</em> skill sets. I would say that a perfect PM won’t even need any leadership skills, while a lousy PM will need a lot of them.

How much of a success was your project to <em>him</em>?</p><aside class="quote">A project is never a success or a failure; it is either dead or alive, that's it.</aside><p>So, a project is never a “success” or a “failure.” A project is either <em>dead</em> or <em>alive</em>, that’s it. Success is a subjective category and can only be measured per stakeholder. And even a small project has many stakeholders. Think about that electricity company who sold you a few kW/h and made some profit out of it? The project was definitely a success for them. What about <strong>mother nature</strong>? Your project was definitely a failure for it, since you produced a few kilograms of CO<sub>2</sub> while making that damn coffee. As you see, success is very subjective.</p><p>And we’re in line with the PMBOK definition. Our coffee making project was indeed a temporary endeavor undertaken to create a unique product, which was a cup of coffee.</p><p>Did we have a project manager? No. Were we doing any project management? No. Well, not <em>explicitly</em>. Obviously, you were the project manager, but you didn’t realize that.</p><p><strong>Project management</strong> is a set of tools to <em>predict</em> the outcome of a project. Planning is one of those tools. Guessing is another one. Expert judgment is yet another one, which you were using while making that coffee. You were an expert and knew how to use the machine, the electricity, and the water tap. You didn’t need any other tools except your <strong>expert judgment</strong>. And it worked. In bigger projects, we would need more powerful instruments and methods. For example, we could use some scheduling software to plan when to put the beans into the machine, when to put that cup under the dipping point and when to press the button. You might also need a budgeting software to calculate how much money you will owe to the roommate. You might use a few risk identification and planning algorithms, etc.</p><aside class="quote">You must try to predict the future with as much accuracy and precision as possible.</aside><p>Most of such tools are mentioned and explained in the PMBOK. They are even grouped there into so called “knowledge areas:” for predicting time, money, risks, people, etc. It’s not important how exactly you predict the future, how many tools you’re using or what knowledge areas you break them into. What’s important is that you must try to do it with as much <em>accuracy</em> and <em>precision</em> as possible. Here comes the definition of the main guy.</p><p>A <strong>project manager</strong> (PM) is the one who predicts the future. The PM knows in what state <i>W<sub>2</sub></i> the world will be when the project is finished. If the PM doesn’t know or is in doubt—it’s a bad PM. If the PM knows and is certain about it—it’s a good PM. That’s it.</p><p>And I have to say, in that coffee making project you were a lousy PM. Did you know what was the probability of the project being finished without a cup of coffee made? A good PM would say that “after an analysis of 230 risks I predict the probability of that coffee being tasteful as 87.4%.” Obviously, you didn’t have that <strong>information</strong>. Next, did you know what would be the total monetary value of the project after its completion? Did you calculate all incurred costs, including the price of environmental damage your coffee machine made? A good PM would say that “the total cost of the project is expected to be $1.09.” Were you able to predict the duration of the project precisely? Well, maybe that one you were rather good at.</p><p>There is only one reason why we want to put a project manager on top of the project. I’m sure you will be surprised to hear it: the only purpose of a PM in a project is to help its key stakeholders (also known as sponsors) to make a <strong>decision</strong>: to <em>kill</em> the project right now or to let it stay <em>alive</em> for a bit more. That’s it.</p><aside class="quote">Project sponsors need to know whether the project is worth going forward.</aside><p>You didn’t need a PM in your coffee making project because you, as its key stakeholder, were fully committed to finish it only when the coffee is ready. But imagine another situation. The coffee machine suddenly breaks, the water stops, the electricity is blacked out and some zombies are knocking at your door. And you still want that cup of coffee. Well, you’re not entirely sure what’s more important now, the coffee or simply finding a way to survive. You will need a more or less accurate <strong>prediction</strong> of how much that coffee will cost you and when will it be ready. If it’s just a few minutes and everything will be fine again, you will keep waiting for it. However, if the prediction is five hours and a risk of failure rate is 93%, you had better terminate this project and do something else.</p><p>That’s exactly what is happening in software development projects and all other projects. Project sponsors need to <em>know</em> whether the project is worth going forward or it’s time to stop it and do something else. That’s what they hire project managers for. This is the only reason of that millions of PMs existence—to <em>predict</em> the future so that we were able to kill our projects before they kill us (read “eat all our resources”).</p><p>You may ask—what about the <strong>coordinating</strong> part? What about <a href="/2015/01/08/morning-standup-meetings.html">morning stand-ups</a>? What about walking around the office and motivating all the <a href="/2015/10/06/how-to-be-good-office-slave.html">office slaves</a> so that they don’t get lazy? Isn’t it the primary responsibility of a PM?</p><p>Not really. This is what a PM does in order to better understand the situation and predict the future. But it’s not what a PM is paid for. Indeed, a bad PM goes around the office and calls <a href="/2015/07/13/meetings-are-legalized-robbery.html">multiple meetings</a> a day. This is also known as “staying on top of things”—a perfect term to define an amateur PM. A bad PM <em>becomes</em> the future, instead of predicting it. He <a href="/2015/09/22/micromanagement.html">micromanages</a> the team by telling everybody what to do, since this is the easiest way to know what will happen and when, in the short-term. But the long-term future stays absolutely unclear. A bad PM mostly relies on expert judgment, just like you did while making that coffee.</p><aside class="quote">A good PM finds a way to organize resources in such a way that their future becomes predictable.</aside><p>A good project manager is a completely different creature. A good PM finds a way to <em>organize</em> resources in such a way that their future becomes <em>predictable</em>. The key word here is “organize.” A good PM organizes people, money, time, risks, stakeholders, and many other things. He uses planning and budgeting software in order to better see the future. But he doesn’t become the future and he doesn’t <em>build</em> the future. His people do that, he just <em>observes</em>. He only collects information from many possible sources and estimates what will happen, how much it will cost and who will suffer most and least. At any moment in time, he <em>knows</em> exactly when the project will be finished, how much it will spend, how many results it will produce, what the quality will be, and what the accuracy of that prediction is.</p><p>A good PM doesn’t personally give orders to the team and doesn’t meet people to tell them what to do. Instead, he makes sure that <a href="/2016/08/23/communication-maturity.html">all communication</a> is happening through a <strong>project management information system</strong> (PMIS). Moreover, in a perfectly organized project, a PM won’t even need to give any orders to the team. Work orders will be created, approved, assigned and verified by the team itself. The PM will make sure that the workflow is seamless and disciplined. But he won’t be personally responsible for telling people what to do.</p><p>A perfect PM won’t even be visible to the team. Everything will be <strong>obvious</strong> and clear: plans will be available, work orders explicitly defined, risks identified and documented, concerns properly reported, stakeholders informed in time, etc. This may sound like utopia, but that’s the true meaning of a “project manager” role.</p><aside class="quote">A charismatic project manager will inevitably ruin the project.</aside><p>I believe it’s already obvious that project management has very little to do with leadership. They are just two <em>orthogonal</em> skill sets. I would say that a perfect PM won’t even need any leadership skills, while a lousy PM will need a lot of them. As far as I understand, being a leader means having enough inner power (also known as “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charisma">charisma</a>”) to make people do what you need. But that’s totally against what we just discussed. A project manager doesn’t want people do what’s needed because of his <strong>charisma</strong>. Instead, he wants people to be leaders of their own tasks. They have to move forward driven by their own motivation and <a href="/2014/09/24/why-monetary-awards-dont-work.html">selfish interests</a>, according to the plans and <a href="/2015/10/13/competition-without-rules.html">rules</a> defined by the PM. A charismatic project manager will inevitably replace the rules by his or her own personality and the entire idea of project management will be ruined.</p><p>This is my understanding of project management.</p></div></article></div><div class="wrapper"> <related-posts /></div><div class="disqus" role="complementary"><p class="disqus_hint"> Please, use <a href="https://help.disqus.com/commenting/what-html-tags-are-allowed-within-comments">syntax highlighting</a> in your comments, to make them more readable.</p><div id="disqus_thread" class="disqus-thread"> <a>&nbsp;</a></div><script> var disqus_config = function () { this.page.url = document.location.href.split('?')[0].split('#')[0].replace('https://', 'http://'); this.page.identifier = this.page.url; }; (function() { var d = document, s = d.createElement('script'); s.src = '//yegor256.disqus.com/embed.js'; s.setAttribute('data-timestamp', +new Date()); (d.head || d.body).appendChild(s); })(); </script> <noscript><div><p class="red"> JavaScript is disabled in your browser, that's why you can't see comments under this post.</p></div></noscript></div><div class="wrapper"> <footer class="footer"><p> &copy; <span itemscope="" itemprop="copyrightHolder" itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"> <span itemprop="name">Yegor Bugayenko</span> </span> 2014&ndash;<span itemprop="copyrightYear">2018</span></p></footer></div></section><div class="wrapper unprintable" style="text-align:center;margin-top:2em;"> <a href="http://www.sixnines.io/h/3ba1652f"> <img src="//www.sixnines.io/b/3ba1652f?style=flat" alt="sixnines availability badge"/> </a></div><script src="//code.jquery.com/jquery-1.9.0.min.js"></script> <script src="/js/all.js?c998b88f617"></script> <script>var disqus_shortname = 'yegor256';</script> <script id="dsq-count-scr" src="//yegor256.disqus.com/count.js" async="async"></script> <script> (function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){ (i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o), m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m) })(window,document,'script','//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga'); ga('create', 'UA-1963507-32', 'auto'); ga('send', 'pageview'); </script> <script> Cd=document;Cr="&"+Math.random();Cp="&s=1"; Cd.cookie="b=b";if(Cd.cookie)Cp+="&c=1"; Cp+="&t="+(new Date()).getTimezoneOffset(); if(self!=top)Cp+="&f=1"; </script> <script> if(navigator.javaEnabled())Cp+="&j=1"; </script> <script> if(typeof(screen)!='undefined')Cp+="&w="+screen.width+"&h="+ screen.height+"&d="+(screen.colorDepth?screen.colorDepth:screen.pixelDepth); </script> <script> Cd.write("<img src='//c.hit.ua/hit?i=95870&g=0&x=2"+Cp+Cr+ "&r="+escape(Cd.referrer)+"&u="+escape(window.location.href)+ "' border='0' wi"+"dth='1' he"+"ight='1'/>"); </script> <script type="application/ld+json"> { "@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Person", "name": "Yegor Bugayenko", "url": "https://www.yegor256.com", "sameAs": [ "https://www.facebook.com/yegor256", "https://instagram.com/yegor256", "https://www.linkedin.com/in/yegor256", "https://twitter.com/yegor256", "https://github.com/yegor256", "https://www.pinterest.com/yegor256/" ] } </script> </body> </html> <!DOCTYPE html> <html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/WebSite"> <head> <meta charset="utf-8"/> <meta name="description" content="&lt;figure class=&quot;badge&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zerocracy.com&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;//www.0crat.com/svg/logo.svg&quot; style=&quot;width:100px;max-width:100%;&quot; alt=&quot;badge&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;At &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zerocracy.com&quot;&gt;Zerocracy&lt;/a&gt;, we’ve been getting about 10 &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/03/08/pimp-up-your-resume.html&quot;&gt;resumes&lt;/a&gt; every day from programmers who want to work with us. We don’t do video or online &lt;a href=&quot;/2017/02/21/say-no-to-google-recruiters.html&quot;&gt;coding interviews&lt;/a&gt;. We don’t ask you to solve any puzzles or demonstrate your algorithm-writing abilities. Moreover, when we decide not to hire you, we honestly and openly explain why. And we almost never offend anyone. So how exactly does it work? There are a few basic principles I would like to share.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;!--more--&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;jb_picture&quot;&gt;&lt;img itemprop=&quot;image&quot; alt=&quot;Wall Street (1987) by Oliver Stone&quot; src=&quot;/images/2016/03/wall-street.jpg&quot; longdesc=&quot;#755bdda0&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption id=&quot;755bdda0&quot;&gt;Wall Street (1987) by Oliver Stone&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;the-market-interviews-you-not-us&quot;&gt;The Market Interviews You, Not Us&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;We believe that the market is a much better interviewer than any one of us. “&lt;em&gt;Instead of demonstrating to us how great your code is, show it to the market and see what it says&lt;/em&gt;”—that’s what we’re saying to you, our candidate.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;How does the market validate that code? &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/12/22/why-dont-you-contribute-to-open-source.html&quot;&gt;Open source&lt;/a&gt;—that’s what is the most convincing to us. We ask you to show us which open source products you have and how popular they are.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Then show us your blog, your conference talks, your hackathon gold medals, your certifications, and any other awards the market has given you. Don’t convince us that you’re cool; convince them. If they will be convinced, we will be glad to hire you. Isn’t that objective? I believe it is.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;quiz&quot;&gt;Quiz&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The way we understand quality of code is &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/08/13/strict-code-quality-control.html&quot;&gt;very different&lt;/a&gt; than what you might expect. Simply put, our quality bar is much higher. Besides that, the way we understand object-oriented programming is also &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/02/03/design-patterns-and-anti-patterns.html&quot;&gt;very different&lt;/a&gt;. So occasionally we’ll find that we simply don’t trust the market as our only source of information, especially when the market has almost nothing to say about you. Some programmers come to us with zero &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/12/22/why-dont-you-contribute-to-open-source.html&quot;&gt;open source&lt;/a&gt; experience, no certificates, and no public work. Still, they claim they are &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/10/29/how-much-do-you-cost.html&quot;&gt;the best&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To put them to the test, we provide a piece of code and ask them to refactor it—just make it better. I think this approach perfectly demonstrates who is in front of me: &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/10/26/hacker-vs-programmer-mentality.html&quot;&gt;a hacker or a designer&lt;/a&gt;. In this way, we filter out a lot of people who pay attention to minor implementation tricks but miss the bigger design issues.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The quiz is &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/teamed/quiz&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. You can see how many &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/teamed/quiz/pulls&quot;&gt;pull requests&lt;/a&gt; there are already—all of them are from our candidates.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;no-phone-or-video-calls&quot;&gt;No Phone or Video Calls&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Most companies talk a lot about diversity and equality, yet most of them will also require a Skype video call or at least a phone call before getting you on board. How does this really jive with the equality emphasis? A face-to-face interview is a very stressful process even for experienced and extroverted people. We can imagine how difficult it is for some programmers who are anti-social introverts just like me.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Video interviewing is a terrible practice unless you’re hiring a stand-up comedian or a flight attendant. Programmers are not supposed to achieve their goals by interacting with people face to face. Well, at least not in our &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/10/07/stop-chatting-start-coding.html&quot;&gt;remote work&lt;/a&gt; mode. We expect you to write code and communicate via GitHub. Why on earth would we need to call you? We just don’t do it, and I think that’s how everybody else should operate. That’s what true equality and diversity is—no phone or video calls.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;we-explain-when-we-reject&quot;&gt;We Explain When We Reject&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;You apply to us and spend time presenting yourself, talking to us, and demonstrating to us your skills and profile. We feel that we have to give something back, especially if we don’t hire you. That’s why we always explain what’s wrong with your application. We are not hiding anything, and sometimes our responses may sound rather disturbing. You may hear something like this: “Your quiz solution is not what I would expect from an experienced developer” (I’m quoting one of our interviewers).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Unlike many other companies, we will never say something like, “Thanks for applying, but we decided not to proceed further. Wish you luck!” That’s shallow and ignorant. But that’s what most big companies do, including Google, Facebook, and other “&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_be_evil&quot;&gt;no evils&lt;/a&gt;.” Try to apply there, and you will see for yourself.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Instead, we believe that an honest and straightforward negative answer is exactly what our candidates are looking for in the case of a rejection. We understand that it’s not the end of the world for you—you’re going to continue learning and improving. Our feedback will help you. So why should we hide it behind that polite “good luck” answer? We won’t. You will know exactly why you are not good enough for us.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Moreover, we are always trying to suggest a direction for improvement. We will recommend what to learn, what to do, and how to grow before coming back to us.

href="https://www.zerocracy.com">Zerocracy</a>, we’ve been getting about 10 <a href="/2016/03/08/pimp-up-your-resume.html">resumes</a> every day from programmers who want to work with us. We don’t do video or online <a href="/2017/02/21/say-no-to-google-recruiters.html">coding interviews</a>. We don’t ask you to solve any puzzles or demonstrate your algorithm-writing abilities. Moreover, when we decide not to hire you, we honestly and openly explain why. And we almost never offend anyone. So how exactly does it work? There are a few basic principles I would like to share.</p><figure class="jb_picture"><img itemprop="image" alt="Wall Street (1987) by Oliver Stone" src="/images/2016/03/wall-street.jpg" longdesc="#755bdda0" /><figcaption id="755bdda0">Wall Street (1987) by Oliver Stone</figcaption></figure><h2 id="the-market-interviews-you-not-us">The Market Interviews You, Not Us</h2><p>We believe that the market is a much better interviewer than any one of us. “<em>Instead of demonstrating to us how great your code is, show it to the market and see what it says</em>”—that’s what we’re saying to you, our candidate.</p><p>How does the market validate that code? <a href="/2015/12/22/why-dont-you-contribute-to-open-source.html">Open source</a>—that’s what is the most convincing to us. We ask you to show us which open source products you have and how popular they are.</p><p>Then show us your blog, your conference talks, your hackathon gold medals, your certifications, and any other awards the market has given you. Don’t convince us that you’re cool; convince them. If they will be convinced, we will be glad to hire you. Isn’t that objective? I believe it is.</p><h2 id="quiz">Quiz</h2><p>The way we understand quality of code is <a href="/2014/08/13/strict-code-quality-control.html">very different</a> than what you might expect. Simply put, our quality bar is much higher. Besides that, the way we understand object-oriented programming is also <a href="/2016/02/03/design-patterns-and-anti-patterns.html">very different</a>. So occasionally we’ll find that we simply don’t trust the market as our only source of information, especially when the market has almost nothing to say about you. Some programmers come to us with zero <a href="/2015/12/22/why-dont-you-contribute-to-open-source.html">open source</a> experience, no certificates, and no public work. Still, they claim they are <a href="/2014/10/29/how-much-do-you-cost.html">the best</a>.</p><p>To put them to the test, we provide a piece of code and ask them to refactor it—just make it better. I think this approach perfectly demonstrates who is in front of me: <a href="/2014/10/26/hacker-vs-programmer-mentality.html">a hacker or a designer</a>. In this way, we filter out a lot of people who pay attention to minor implementation tricks but miss the bigger design issues.</p><p>The quiz is <a href="https://github.com/teamed/quiz">here</a>. You can see how many <a href="https://github.com/teamed/quiz/pulls">pull requests</a> there are already—all of them are from our candidates.</p><h2 id="no-phone-or-video-calls">No Phone or Video Calls</h2><p>Most companies talk a lot about diversity and equality, yet most of them will also require a Skype video call or at least a phone call before getting you on board. How does this really jive with the equality emphasis? A face-to-face interview is a very stressful process even for experienced and extroverted people. We can imagine how difficult it is for some programmers who are anti-social introverts just like me.</p><p>Video interviewing is a terrible practice unless you’re hiring a stand-up comedian or a flight attendant. Programmers are not supposed to achieve their goals by interacting with people face to face. Well, at least not in our <a href="/2014/10/07/stop-chatting-start-coding.html">remote work</a> mode. We expect you to write code and communicate via GitHub. Why on earth would we need to call you? We just don’t do it, and I think that’s how everybody else should operate. That’s what true equality and diversity is—no phone or video calls.</p><h2 id="we-explain-when-we-reject">We Explain When We Reject</h2><p>You apply to us and spend time presenting yourself, talking to us, and demonstrating to us your skills and profile. We feel that we have to give something back, especially if we don’t hire you. That’s why we always explain what’s wrong with your application. We are not hiding anything, and sometimes our responses may sound rather disturbing. You may hear something like this: “Your quiz solution is not what I would expect from an experienced developer” (I’m quoting one of our interviewers).</p><p>Unlike many other companies, we will never say something like, “Thanks for applying, but we decided not to proceed further. Wish you luck!” That’s shallow and ignorant. But that’s what most big companies do, including Google, Facebook, and other “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_be_evil">no evils</a>.” Try to apply there, and you will see for yourself.</p><p>Instead, we believe that an honest and straightforward negative answer is exactly what our candidates are looking for in the case of a rejection. We understand that it’s not the end of the world for you—you’re going to continue learning and improving. Our feedback will help you. So why should we hide it behind that polite “good luck” answer? We won’t. You will know exactly why you are not good enough for us.</p><p>Moreover, we are always trying to suggest a direction for improvement. We will recommend what to learn, what to do, and how to grow before coming back to us.

We don’t want any of them to live forever; we want them to finish as soon as possible, and obviously with a positive outcome.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Because of this fundamental difference, a project must be managed by an authoritative person who gives orders and has enough guts to ensure those orders are obeyed. That person is called a &lt;strong&gt;project manager&lt;/strong&gt; (PM).

A project cannot be flat, or it will fall apart.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Since a project is a temporary endeavor, it doesn’t give security to its participants. And it doesn’t take away our freedom.

A project should resemble a <a href="/2016/07/21/convince-me.html">dictatorship</a>, authoritarian or military hierarchy with a single strong, result-oriented leader who gives explicit orders that are never doubted by subordinates and an explicitly defined hierarchy.</p><figure class="jb_picture"><img itemprop="image" alt="Apocalypse Now (1979) by Francis Ford Coppola" src="/images/2016/02/apocalypse-now.jpg" longdesc="#6d5c2e32" /><figcaption id="6d5c2e32">Apocalypse Now (1979) by Francis Ford Coppola</figcaption></figure><p>According to Wikipedia at the time of writing, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holacracy"><strong>holacracy</strong></a> exists when “authority and decision-making are distributed” while, on the other hand, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autocracy"><strong>autocracy</strong></a> exists when “supreme power is concentrated in the hands of one person.”</p><p>When I say organization, I mean a team, a startup, a company, that sort of thing. It’s something with a brand, an office, a business entity and a bank account. The role of an organization is very similar to the role of a country or a government: to provide security in exchange for freedom. Democracy in a country, as well as in a team, guarantees <strong>equality</strong> to its members, which is the most important component of security.</p><p>A holacracy, also known as a “flat organization,” technically refers to the absence of bureaucracy, special privileges, expensive furniture and private parties for top management. In a flat team, the distance between the CEO and a junior programmer is very small. They sit together in the same room, eat in the same cafe, and discuss team strategy like friends. There are no “bosses” on a flat team, only “<strong>leaders</strong>.” They don’t give orders, they <strong>inspire</strong>. They don’t punish, they celebrate success and mourn failure together with everybody. Well, that’s the idea of a holacracy. And it actually works. I’ve seen it many times.</p><aside class="quote">The key objective of a project is to end, while an organization's objective is to survive</aside><p>However, when we’re talking about <strong>project</strong> management, this very same approach will have catastrophic consequences. A project is something very different than a team. A project is a “temporary endeavor undertaken to create a unique product, service, or result,” according to <a href="http://www.pmi.org/PMBOK-Guide-and-Standards.aspx">PMBOK</a>. A project is something that starts and ends. The key objective of a project is to <strong>end</strong>, while an organization’s objective is to <strong>survive</strong>. See the difference? A new mobile app, a conference, a new release, a round of investments—these are examples of projects. They start, and they end. We don’t want any of them to live forever; we want them to finish as soon as possible, and obviously with a positive outcome.</p><p>Because of this fundamental difference, a project must be managed by an authoritative person who gives orders and has enough guts to ensure those orders are obeyed. That person is called a <strong>project manager</strong> (PM). And the project will be successful only if its management structure is strictly hierarchical, just like in a military operation. A project cannot be flat, or it will fall apart.</p><p>Since a project is a temporary endeavor, it doesn’t give security to its participants. And it doesn’t take away our freedom. The arrangement is different: A project gives us <strong>money</strong> and takes our <strong>time</strong>.

You must be creative, innovative, and very open-minded. You never know which method of punishment will work with whom. Some people respond to one method, while others may completely ignore it.

This, of course, is your best instrument of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punishment&quot;&gt;punishment&lt;/a&gt;. Make sure he is scared of you. He must know who he &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/01/26/happy-boss-false-objective.html&quot;&gt;works for&lt;/a&gt;—you, his boss. The rule of thumb is that the one with the strongest voice is the boss. Thus, you must be heard, you must &lt;em&gt;rule&lt;/em&gt; with your voice, and he must physically feel your presence in the room. Even if it’s just a Skype &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/08/23/communication-maturity.html&quot;&gt;call&lt;/a&gt;, your voice must sound stronger than all others. Moreover, don’t let him speak if he is trying to &lt;a href=&quot;/2017/01/03/how-much-you-love-conflicts.html&quot;&gt;argue back&lt;/a&gt;. You’re the boss! The &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_%28ethology%29&quot;&gt;alpha&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Play Hard to Get&lt;/strong&gt;. Is he feeling &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guilt_%28emotion%29&quot;&gt;guilty&lt;/a&gt; for an error? Simply ignore him. Or, even better, schedule &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/07/13/meetings-are-legalized-robbery.html&quot;&gt;meetings&lt;/a&gt; and don’t show up. Or reschedule many times. That will demonstrate that you’re not interested in him anymore. His frustration will grow. You’ll still be in the office, having meetings with other employees, eating lunch, laughing, walking, and talking. You exist, but not for him. He is dead to you, because of his mistake. He is nothing and is getting the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silent_treatment&quot;&gt;silent treatment&lt;/a&gt;. Then, suddenly, you attend a meeting! Oh, how happy he will be. He will literally kiss your hands, and you will love that feeling!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make Fun of Him&lt;/strong&gt;. We inherit this technique from good, old-school &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullying&quot;&gt;bullying&lt;/a&gt;. We all know how it works. Select the person who messed up and make him the target of your jokes. In the office, this method works even better than in school, because you’re the boss and he basically can’t do anything to you. He will first try to laugh alongside everybody else, but this won’t last for the long term. In the end, everybody will laugh at him, and he will do whatever it takes just to stop it. He will obey any order you give!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Having a personal life outside the office is not for everybody; it is a luxury.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mistakes Must be Visible&lt;/strong&gt;. Is he wrong? Did he miss a deadline? Did he deploy a broken version to production? Did he forget something? Don’t resolve this face to face. Always make such things public, simply to let others punish him. This approach is known as &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer_pressure&quot;&gt;peer pressure&lt;/a&gt;, a very useful technique. His coworkers must keep up the momentum and punish him using &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_rejection&quot;&gt;social rejection&lt;/a&gt;. That’s why, by all means, you as a leader must encourage back-stabbing. You will rise to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_and_control_in_abusive_relationships&quot;&gt;power&lt;/a&gt; much faster if your employees are not only afraid of you but also of each other. Use their fear wisely!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Late-Night Phone Calls&lt;/strong&gt;. Having a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_life&quot;&gt;personal life&lt;/a&gt; outside the office is not for everybody. It is a luxury, and you are not just going to give it away. He must earn it, and if he is guilty of not completing a task on time, his private life will be ruined by your late-night phone calls. He must remember that. It doesn’t really matter what exactly the calls are about. Just make them somewhere around 11 p.m. Your key message is this: “I’m worrying about the project while you’re enjoying your family time!” Guilt is what you’re planting with this. He won’t be able to ask you not to call him after work; he is not that brave. He will instead try to please you somehow so that you stop calling him.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;youtube&quot;&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibT5oKToMoQ&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;box&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ibT5oKToMoQ/mqdefault.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;YouTube video #ibT5oKToMoQ&quot; /&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;play&quot;&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;icon icon-play&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;div&gt;Daily Stand-Up Meetings Are Evil (webinar #11); 3 February 2016.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t Check Results&lt;/strong&gt;. This technique is close to playing hard to get, but here you don’t ignore him. You communicate with the guilty employee, but you don’t talk about his results. You discuss his uncle’s wedding, his snowboarding weekend, his new bicycle, etc. But you don’t ask about the migration to PostgreSQL he has been working on for the last three weeks. You are &lt;em&gt;not interested&lt;/em&gt;. This is a perfect method for demonstrating that you don’t see him as a valuable team member anymore. The &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/02/18/holacracy-autocracy.html&quot;&gt;team&lt;/a&gt; doesn’t need his results. The team can live without them. You will see how soon he realizes who the boss is and what it means when the boss is not happy!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Obviously, the best desk is the one at which nobody can see your monitor.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Bad Office Spot Is a Great De-Motivator&lt;/strong&gt;. This is a classic instrument of punishment: The worst desks go to those who forget who the boss is around here. Obviously, the best desk is the one at which nobody can see your monitor. Give those to good people who obey your orders and don’t argue with you. They are your core team. They support you as a &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/05/24/who-is-project-manager.html&quot;&gt;leader&lt;/a&gt;, and they help you rise to power. Others must sit closer to the door, and their monitors must be seen by everybody. As with all other techniques, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_manipulation&quot;&gt;conceal&lt;/a&gt; your intentions—you locate people in the office due to their job descriptions in order to help them communicate effectively. Everybody will understand what’s really going on, but you must look like a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leadership_style#Laissez-faire&quot;&gt;laissez-faire leader&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Easy Tasks Are Rewards&lt;/strong&gt;. You decide who does what, and you distribute tasks and projects—that’s your instrument of power. Easy-to-do tasks are how you reward those who are &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/10/06/how-to-be-good-office-slave.html&quot;&gt;loyal&lt;/a&gt; and supportive. They complete such tasks, hardly expending any effort. Complex and risky projects, on the other hand, are assigned to the under-performing employee. He will most likely fail, and there won’t be anyone to blame—it’s just a project, like all others. Boring, ambiguous, unfocused, unnecessary, under-funded, and routine tasks all go to the employee who deserves punishment. Of course, you must look unbiased—be very polite and supportive, acting as if you’re a good friend!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Leaving the office at 5 p.m. is a privilege; only the best employees can afford it.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spread Rumors&lt;/strong&gt;. Simply show your annoyance of his poor results, but not to his face. Talk about his performance with his coworkers. They must know that you’re not happy. Furthermore, they must suspect that you’re thinking about &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/09/16/how-to-fire-someone-right.html&quot;&gt;terminating&lt;/a&gt; his contract. Don’t say it straight away, but don’t deny it if they ask. I doubt they will ask, though. Very soon, these rumors will reach his ear, and he will do whatever it takes just to hear that you’re not thinking about termination anymore. He will likely be scared to ask you directly, but even if he does ask, deny it. He will be afraid of you anyway. That will make him much more manageable!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Overtime&lt;/strong&gt;. Leaving the office at 5 p.m. is a privilege. Only the best employees can afford it. Ideally, everybody must ask you before they leave. The one who feels guilty won’t be comfortable asking you whether he can leave at 5 p.m. He will stay longer just because he is afraid to ask. That’s exactly what you need! Just to earn the ability to ask whether it’s possible to leave the office, he will work harder. The question is how to make employees ask for your permission to go home in the first place. I recommend you stay late and schedule interesting meetings at 6 p.m. Of course, you will come to work at 1 p.m., while everybody else must be there at 9 a.m. sharp. The point is that you must be in the office when they leave, and you must do something important. They will be afraid to disappoint you by showing ignorance, so they will ask for permission. That’s what you need!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;hr /&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;badge&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/2bNjruM&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.yegor256.com/images/2016/01/management-stripped-bare.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width:96px;max-width:100%;&quot; alt=&quot;badge&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;This list is definitely not exhaustive.

Even if it’s just a Skype &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/08/23/communication-maturity.html&quot;&gt;call&lt;/a&gt;, your voice must sound stronger than all others. Moreover, don’t let him speak if he is trying to &lt;a href=&quot;/2017/01/03/how-much-you-love-conflicts.html&quot;&gt;argue back&lt;/a&gt;. You’re the boss! The &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_%28ethology%29&quot;&gt;alpha&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Play Hard to Get&lt;/strong&gt;. Is he feeling &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guilt_%28emotion%29&quot;&gt;guilty&lt;/a&gt; for an error? Simply ignore him. Or, even better, schedule &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/07/13/meetings-are-legalized-robbery.html&quot;&gt;meetings&lt;/a&gt; and don’t show up. Or reschedule many times. That will demonstrate that you’re not interested in him anymore. His frustration will grow. You’ll still be in the office, having meetings with other employees, eating lunch, laughing, walking, and talking. You exist, but not for him. He is dead to you, because of his mistake. He is nothing and is getting the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silent_treatment&quot;&gt;silent treatment&lt;/a&gt;. Then, suddenly, you attend a meeting! Oh, how happy he will be. He will literally kiss your hands, and you will love that feeling!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make Fun of Him&lt;/strong&gt;. We inherit this technique from good, old-school &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullying&quot;&gt;bullying&lt;/a&gt;. We all know how it works. Select the person who messed up and make him the target of your jokes. In the office, this method works even better than in school, because you’re the boss and he basically can’t do anything to you. He will first try to laugh alongside everybody else, but this won’t last for the long term. In the end, everybody will laugh at him, and he will do whatever it takes just to stop it. He will obey any order you give!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Having a personal life outside the office is not for everybody; it is a luxury.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mistakes Must be Visible&lt;/strong&gt;. Is he wrong? Did he miss a deadline? Did he deploy a broken version to production? Did he forget something? Don’t resolve this face to face. Always make such things public, simply to let others punish him. This approach is known as &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer_pressure&quot;&gt;peer pressure&lt;/a&gt;, a very useful technique. His coworkers must keep up the momentum and punish him using &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_rejection&quot;&gt;social rejection&lt;/a&gt;. That’s why, by all means, you as a leader must encourage back-stabbing. You will rise to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_and_control_in_abusive_relationships&quot;&gt;power&lt;/a&gt; much faster if your employees are not only afraid of you but also of each other. Use their fear wisely!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Late-Night Phone Calls&lt;/strong&gt;. Having a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_life&quot;&gt;personal life&lt;/a&gt; outside the office is not for everybody. It is a luxury, and you are not just going to give it away. He must earn it, and if he is guilty of not completing a task on time, his private life will be ruined by your late-night phone calls. He must remember that. It doesn’t really matter what exactly the calls are about. Just make them somewhere around 11 p.m. Your key message is this: “I’m worrying about the project while you’re enjoying your family time!” Guilt is what you’re planting with this. He won’t be able to ask you not to call him after work; he is not that brave. He will instead try to please you somehow so that you stop calling him.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;youtube&quot;&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibT5oKToMoQ&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;box&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ibT5oKToMoQ/mqdefault.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;YouTube video #ibT5oKToMoQ&quot; /&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;play&quot;&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;icon icon-play&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;div&gt;Daily Stand-Up Meetings Are Evil (webinar #11); 3 February 2016.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t Check Results&lt;/strong&gt;. This technique is close to playing hard to get, but here you don’t ignore him. You communicate with the guilty employee, but you don’t talk about his results. You discuss his uncle’s wedding, his snowboarding weekend, his new bicycle, etc. But you don’t ask about the migration to PostgreSQL he has been working on for the last three weeks. You are &lt;em&gt;not interested&lt;/em&gt;. This is a perfect method for demonstrating that you don’t see him as a valuable team member anymore. The &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/02/18/holacracy-autocracy.html&quot;&gt;team&lt;/a&gt; doesn’t need his results. The team can live without them. You will see how soon he realizes who the boss is and what it means when the boss is not happy!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Obviously, the best desk is the one at which nobody can see your monitor.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Bad Office Spot Is a Great De-Motivator&lt;/strong&gt;. This is a classic instrument of punishment: The worst desks go to those who forget who the boss is around here. Obviously, the best desk is the one at which nobody can see your monitor. Give those to good people who obey your orders and don’t argue with you. They are your core team. They support you as a &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/05/24/who-is-project-manager.html&quot;&gt;leader&lt;/a&gt;, and they help you rise to power. Others must sit closer to the door, and their monitors must be seen by everybody. As with all other techniques, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_manipulation&quot;&gt;conceal&lt;/a&gt; your intentions—you locate people in the office due to their job descriptions in order to help them communicate effectively. Everybody will understand what’s really going on, but you must look like a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leadership_style#Laissez-faire&quot;&gt;laissez-faire leader&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Easy Tasks Are Rewards&lt;/strong&gt;. You decide who does what, and you distribute tasks and projects—that’s your instrument of power. Easy-to-do tasks are how you reward those who are &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/10/06/how-to-be-good-office-slave.html&quot;&gt;loyal&lt;/a&gt; and supportive. They complete such tasks, hardly expending any effort. Complex and risky projects, on the other hand, are assigned to the under-performing employee. He will most likely fail, and there won’t be anyone to blame—it’s just a project, like all others. Boring, ambiguous, unfocused, unnecessary, under-funded, and routine tasks all go to the employee who deserves punishment. Of course, you must look unbiased—be very polite and supportive, acting as if you’re a good friend!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Leaving the office at 5 p.m. is a privilege; only the best employees can afford it.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spread Rumors&lt;/strong&gt;. Simply show your annoyance of his poor results, but not to his face. Talk about his performance with his coworkers. They must know that you’re not happy. Furthermore, they must suspect that you’re thinking about &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/09/16/how-to-fire-someone-right.html&quot;&gt;terminating&lt;/a&gt; his contract. Don’t say it straight away, but don’t deny it if they ask. I doubt they will ask, though. Very soon, these rumors will reach his ear, and he will do whatever it takes just to hear that you’re not thinking about termination anymore. He will likely be scared to ask you directly, but even if he does ask, deny it. He will be afraid of you anyway. That will make him much more manageable!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Overtime&lt;/strong&gt;. Leaving the office at 5 p.m. is a privilege. Only the best employees can afford it. Ideally, everybody must ask you before they leave. The one who feels guilty won’t be comfortable asking you whether he can leave at 5 p.m. He will stay longer just because he is afraid to ask. That’s exactly what you need! Just to earn the ability to ask whether it’s possible to leave the office, he will work harder. The question is how to make employees ask for your permission to go home in the first place. I recommend you stay late and schedule interesting meetings at 6 p.m. Of course, you will come to work at 1 p.m., while everybody else must be there at 9 a.m. sharp. The point is that you must be in the office when they leave, and you must do something important. They will be afraid to disappoint you by showing ignorance, so they will ask for permission. That’s what you need!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;hr /&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;badge&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/2bNjruM&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.yegor256.com/images/2016/01/management-stripped-bare.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width:96px;max-width:100%;&quot; alt=&quot;badge&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;This list is definitely not exhaustive. I’m sure there are many more &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychopathy&quot;&gt;interesting&lt;/a&gt; methods and technologies. Don’t hesitate to share them below in the comments. As I said above, I believe this is an art, not a science.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;PS.

do you prefer to do it? There are many ways to punish employees; some are rather effective, while others simply don’t work. This is not an exact science. Actually, I would say it’s an <em>art</em>. You must be creative, innovative, and very open-minded. You never know which method of punishment will work with whom. Some people respond to one method, while others may completely ignore it. The overarching goal, of course, is to make employees <em>scared</em> of <em>you</em>, their boss, so they will obey enthusiastically. Here is a list of the most effective methods.</p><figure class="jb_picture"><img itemprop="image" alt="Office Space (1999) by Mike Judge" src="/images/2016/01/office-space.jpg" longdesc="#cbdf548c" /><figcaption id="cbdf548c">Office Space (1999) by Mike Judge</figcaption></figure><p>Disclaimer: I’m using the pronoun “he” merely for simplicity of speech.

There are many ways to punish employees; some are rather effective, while others simply don’t work. This is not an exact science. Actually, I would say it’s an <em>art</em>. You must be creative, innovative, and very open-minded. You never know which method of punishment will work with whom. Some people respond to one method, while others may completely ignore it. The overarching goal, of course, is to make employees <em>scared</em> of <em>you</em>, their boss, so they will obey enthusiastically. Here is a list of the most effective methods.</p><figure class="jb_picture"><img itemprop="image" alt="Office Space (1999) by Mike Judge" src="/images/2016/01/office-space.jpg" longdesc="#cbdf548c" /><figcaption id="cbdf548c">Office Space (1999) by Mike Judge</figcaption></figure><p>Disclaimer: I’m using the pronoun “he” merely for simplicity of speech.

This, of course, is your best instrument of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punishment">punishment</a>. Make sure he is scared of you. He must know who he <a href="/2015/01/26/happy-boss-false-objective.html">works for</a>—you, his boss. The rule of thumb is that the one with the strongest voice is the boss. Thus, you must be heard, you must <em>rule</em> with your voice, and he must physically feel your presence in the room. Even if it’s just a Skype <a href="/2016/08/23/communication-maturity.html">call</a>, your voice must sound stronger than all others. Moreover, don’t let him speak if he is trying to <a href="/2017/01/03/how-much-you-love-conflicts.html">argue back</a>. You’re the boss! The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_%28ethology%29">alpha</a>!</p><p><strong>Play Hard to Get</strong>. Is he feeling <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guilt_%28emotion%29">guilty</a> for an error? Simply ignore him. Or, even better, schedule <a href="/2015/07/13/meetings-are-legalized-robbery.html">meetings</a> and don’t show up. Or reschedule many times. That will demonstrate that you’re not interested in him anymore. His frustration will grow. You’ll still be in the office, having meetings with other employees, eating lunch, laughing, walking, and talking. You exist, but not for him. He is dead to you, because of his mistake. He is nothing and is getting the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silent_treatment">silent treatment</a>. Then, suddenly, you attend a meeting! Oh, how happy he will be. He will literally kiss your hands, and you will love that feeling!</p><p><strong>Make Fun of Him</strong>. We inherit this technique from good, old-school <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullying">bullying</a>. We all know how it works. Select the person who messed up and make him the target of your jokes. In the office, this method works even better than in school, because you’re the boss and he basically can’t do anything to you. He will first try to laugh alongside everybody else, but this won’t last for the long term. In the end, everybody will laugh at him, and he will do whatever it takes just to stop it. He will obey any order you give!</p><aside class="quote">Having a personal life outside the office is not for everybody; it is a luxury.</aside><p><strong>Mistakes Must be Visible</strong>. Is he wrong? Did he miss a deadline? Did he deploy a broken version to production? Did he forget something? Don’t resolve this face to face. Always make such things public, simply to let others punish him. This approach is known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer_pressure">peer pressure</a>, a very useful technique. His coworkers must keep up the momentum and punish him using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_rejection">social rejection</a>. That’s why, by all means, you as a leader must encourage back-stabbing. You will rise to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_and_control_in_abusive_relationships">power</a> much faster if your employees are not only afraid of you but also of each other. Use their fear wisely!</p><p><strong>Late-Night Phone Calls</strong>. Having a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_life">personal life</a> outside the office is not for everybody. It is a luxury, and you are not just going to give it away. He must earn it, and if he is guilty of not completing a task on time, his private life will be ruined by your late-night phone calls. He must remember that. It doesn’t really matter what exactly the calls are about. Just make them somewhere around 11 p.m. Your key message is this: “I’m worrying about the project while you’re enjoying your family time!” Guilt is what you’re planting with this. He won’t be able to ask you not to call him after work; he is not that brave. He will instead try to please you somehow so that you stop calling him.</p><aside class="youtube"> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibT5oKToMoQ"><div class="box"> <img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ibT5oKToMoQ/mqdefault.jpg" alt="YouTube video #ibT5oKToMoQ" /><div class="play"><i class="icon icon-play"></i></div></div></a><div>Daily Stand-Up Meetings Are Evil (webinar #11); 3 February 2016.</div></aside><p><strong>Don’t Check Results</strong>. This technique is close to playing hard to get, but here you don’t ignore him. You communicate with the guilty employee, but you don’t talk about his results. You discuss his uncle’s wedding, his snowboarding weekend, his new bicycle, etc. But you don’t ask about the migration to PostgreSQL he has been working on for the last three weeks. You are <em>not interested</em>. This is a perfect method for demonstrating that you don’t see him as a valuable team member anymore. The <a href="/2016/02/18/holacracy-autocracy.html">team</a> doesn’t need his results. The team can live without them. You will see how soon he realizes who the boss is and what it means when the boss is not happy!</p><aside class="quote">Obviously, the best desk is the one at which nobody can see your monitor.</aside><p><strong>A Bad Office Spot Is a Great De-Motivator</strong>. This is a classic instrument of punishment: The worst desks go to those who forget who the boss is around here. Obviously, the best desk is the one at which nobody can see your monitor. Give those to good people who obey your orders and don’t argue with you. They are your core team. They support you as a <a href="/2016/05/24/who-is-project-manager.html">leader</a>, and they help you rise to power. Others must sit closer to the door, and their monitors must be seen by everybody. As with all other techniques, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_manipulation">conceal</a> your intentions—you locate people in the office due to their job descriptions in order to help them communicate effectively. Everybody will understand what’s really going on, but you must look like a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leadership_style#Laissez-faire">laissez-faire leader</a>.</p><p><strong>Easy Tasks Are Rewards</strong>.

It’s a really good read, but rather generic. It is not specifically about software teams. My experience is mostly focused on programmers and their turnover. I’ve learned that low turnover negatively affects code maintainability and encourages &lt;strong&gt;hero-driven development&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;strong code ownership&lt;/strong&gt; (both of which are bad practices).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;If you consider programmers to be a valuable long-term asset, you're wrong&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Turnover” is basically the act of replacing an employee with a new employee for any reason, including termination, retirement, resignation, or any other. Simply put, the more people your team loses every year, the higher your turnover. If there are 20 programmers on your team, and five of them walk away every year, your turnover is 25 percent.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;youtube&quot;&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbovkm0tTn0&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;box&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xbovkm0tTn0/mqdefault.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;YouTube video #xbovkm0tTn0&quot; /&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;play&quot;&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;icon icon-play&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;div&gt;Talk &quot;MEETING-FREE SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT, IN DISTRIBUTED TEAMS&quot; by Yegor Bugayenko; 29 April 2016.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;I can’t pinpoint what number you should aim for, but I strongly believe that if you consider &lt;strong&gt;programmers&lt;/strong&gt; to be a &lt;strong&gt;valuable long-term asset&lt;/strong&gt;, and try to retain them at all cost, you’re doing it wrong.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;My point is that a healthy software team must &lt;strong&gt;replace&lt;/strong&gt; programmers &lt;strong&gt;regularly&lt;/strong&gt;. I would say having one person on board for longer than a year is asking for trouble.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;By replacing, I don’t necessarily mean &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/09/16/how-to-fire-someone-right.html&quot;&gt;firing&lt;/a&gt;. Not at all. I mean moving them &lt;strong&gt;away&lt;/strong&gt; from the code base. Obviously, if you have a single code base, replacing will mean firing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When programmers stay together for a long time, working on the same code base, they inevitably become subject matter &lt;strong&gt;experts&lt;/strong&gt;. First of all, this leads to strong code ownership. Naturally, each of them becomes a specialist in his or her own part of the code, mostly because it’s easier to work with something you’re familiar with instead of jumping from module to module. Needless to say, strong code ownership is a bad practice. Collective code ownership is a much better alternative, as &lt;a href=&quot;http://martinfowler.com/bliki/CodeOwnership.html&quot;&gt;explained&lt;/a&gt; by Martin Fowler.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Having strong experts on the team inevitably leads to hero-driven development&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;Then, having strong experts on the team inevitably leads to hero-driven development, where firefighting is very much appreciated. An expert doesn’t want to lose his or her position, and always tries to demonstrate how valuable he or she is for the team. The best way to do this is to solve a problem that nobody else can solve. That’s how one gets “job security.” And that’s how the team starts to degrade. This &lt;a href=&quot;http://highlevelbits.com/2014/08/hero-driven-development.html&quot;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; by Fredrik Rubensson is right about this problem.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;youtube&quot;&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pt9uHp35fwM&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;box&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pt9uHp35fwM/mqdefault.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;YouTube video #pt9uHp35fwM&quot; /&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;play&quot;&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;icon icon-play&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;div&gt;Meetings Or Discipline; 26 April 2016.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thus, to achieve higher maintainability of the source code and robustness of the product, we must &lt;strong&gt;rotate&lt;/strong&gt; programmers, preventing them from becoming subject matter experts.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I realize this idea sounds counter-intuitive, but think about it. By keeping people together, working on the same problem for a long time, we put a lot of knowledge into their heads, not our source code. These people become the &lt;strong&gt;asset&lt;/strong&gt;. They become smarter, they know the solution very well, and they solve all issues rather quickly. But the code base degrades.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When the time comes to change someone (for any reason), the loss will be damaging. We may lose significant knowledge, and the code base left behind will be unmaintainable. In most cases, we will have to re-write it.

It’s a really good read, but rather generic. It is not specifically about software teams. My experience is mostly focused on programmers and their turnover. I’ve learned that low turnover negatively affects code maintainability and encourages &lt;strong&gt;hero-driven development&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;strong code ownership&lt;/strong&gt; (both of which are bad practices).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;If you consider programmers to be a valuable long-term asset, you're wrong&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Turnover” is basically the act of replacing an employee with a new employee for any reason, including termination, retirement, resignation, or any other. Simply put, the more people your team loses every year, the higher your turnover. If there are 20 programmers on your team, and five of them walk away every year, your turnover is 25 percent.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;youtube&quot;&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbovkm0tTn0&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;box&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xbovkm0tTn0/mqdefault.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;YouTube video #xbovkm0tTn0&quot; /&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;play&quot;&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;icon icon-play&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;div&gt;Talk &quot;MEETING-FREE SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT, IN DISTRIBUTED TEAMS&quot; by Yegor Bugayenko; 29 April 2016.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;I can’t pinpoint what number you should aim for, but I strongly believe that if you consider &lt;strong&gt;programmers&lt;/strong&gt; to be a &lt;strong&gt;valuable long-term asset&lt;/strong&gt;, and try to retain them at all cost, you’re doing it wrong.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;My point is that a healthy software team must &lt;strong&gt;replace&lt;/strong&gt; programmers &lt;strong&gt;regularly&lt;/strong&gt;. I would say having one person on board for longer than a year is asking for trouble.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;By replacing, I don’t necessarily mean &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/09/16/how-to-fire-someone-right.html&quot;&gt;firing&lt;/a&gt;. Not at all. I mean moving them &lt;strong&gt;away&lt;/strong&gt; from the code base. Obviously, if you have a single code base, replacing will mean firing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When programmers stay together for a long time, working on the same code base, they inevitably become subject matter &lt;strong&gt;experts&lt;/strong&gt;. First of all, this leads to strong code ownership. Naturally, each of them becomes a specialist in his or her own part of the code, mostly because it’s easier to work with something you’re familiar with instead of jumping from module to module. Needless to say, strong code ownership is a bad practice. Collective code ownership is a much better alternative, as &lt;a href=&quot;http://martinfowler.com/bliki/CodeOwnership.html&quot;&gt;explained&lt;/a&gt; by Martin Fowler.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Having strong experts on the team inevitably leads to hero-driven development&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;Then, having strong experts on the team inevitably leads to hero-driven development, where firefighting is very much appreciated. An expert doesn’t want to lose his or her position, and always tries to demonstrate how valuable he or she is for the team. The best way to do this is to solve a problem that nobody else can solve. That’s how one gets “job security.” And that’s how the team starts to degrade. This &lt;a href=&quot;http://highlevelbits.com/2014/08/hero-driven-development.html&quot;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; by Fredrik Rubensson is right about this problem.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;youtube&quot;&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pt9uHp35fwM&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;box&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pt9uHp35fwM/mqdefault.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;YouTube video #pt9uHp35fwM&quot; /&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;play&quot;&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;icon icon-play&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;div&gt;Meetings Or Discipline; 26 April 2016.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thus, to achieve higher maintainability of the source code and robustness of the product, we must &lt;strong&gt;rotate&lt;/strong&gt; programmers, preventing them from becoming subject matter experts.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I realize this idea sounds counter-intuitive, but think about it. By keeping people together, working on the same problem for a long time, we put a lot of knowledge into their heads, not our source code. These people become the &lt;strong&gt;asset&lt;/strong&gt;. They become smarter, they know the solution very well, and they solve all issues rather quickly. But the code base degrades.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When the time comes to change someone (for any reason), the loss will be damaging. We may lose significant knowledge, and the code base left behind will be unmaintainable. In most cases, we will have to re-write it.

However, I believe that low turnover may also be very harmful.</p><figure class="jb_picture"><img itemprop="image" alt="Commando (1985) by Mark L.

It’s a really good read, but rather generic. It is not specifically about software teams. My experience is mostly focused on programmers and their turnover. I’ve learned that low turnover negatively affects code maintainability and encourages <strong>hero-driven development</strong> and <strong>strong code ownership</strong> (both of which are bad practices).</p><aside class="quote">If you consider programmers to be a valuable long-term asset, you're wrong</aside><p>“Turnover” is basically the act of replacing an employee with a new employee for any reason, including termination, retirement, resignation, or any other. Simply put, the more people your team loses every year, the higher your turnover. If there are 20 programmers on your team, and five of them walk away every year, your turnover is 25 percent.</p><aside class="youtube"> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbovkm0tTn0"><div class="box"> <img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xbovkm0tTn0/mqdefault.jpg" alt="YouTube video #xbovkm0tTn0" /><div class="play"><i class="icon icon-play"></i></div></div></a><div>Talk "MEETING-FREE SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT, IN DISTRIBUTED TEAMS" by Yegor Bugayenko; 29 April 2016.</div></aside><p>I can’t pinpoint what number you should aim for, but I strongly believe that if you consider <strong>programmers</strong> to be a <strong>valuable long-term asset</strong>, and try to retain them at all cost, you’re doing it wrong.</p><p>My point is that a healthy software team must <strong>replace</strong> programmers <strong>regularly</strong>. I would say having one person on board for longer than a year is asking for trouble.</p><p>By replacing, I don’t necessarily mean <a href="/2015/09/16/how-to-fire-someone-right.html">firing</a>. Not at all. I mean moving them <strong>away</strong> from the code base. Obviously, if you have a single code base, replacing will mean firing.</p><p>When programmers stay together for a long time, working on the same code base, they inevitably become subject matter <strong>experts</strong>. First of all, this leads to strong code ownership. Naturally, each of them becomes a specialist in his or her own part of the code, mostly because it’s easier to work with something you’re familiar with instead of jumping from module to module. Needless to say, strong code ownership is a bad practice. Collective code ownership is a much better alternative, as <a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/CodeOwnership.html">explained</a> by Martin Fowler.</p><aside class="quote">Having strong experts on the team inevitably leads to hero-driven development</aside><p>Then, having strong experts on the team inevitably leads to hero-driven development, where firefighting is very much appreciated. An expert doesn’t want to lose his or her position, and always tries to demonstrate how valuable he or she is for the team. The best way to do this is to solve a problem that nobody else can solve. That’s how one gets “job security.” And that’s how the team starts to degrade. This <a href="http://highlevelbits.com/2014/08/hero-driven-development.html">blog post</a> by Fredrik Rubensson is right about this problem.</p><aside class="youtube"> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pt9uHp35fwM"><div class="box"> <img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pt9uHp35fwM/mqdefault.jpg" alt="YouTube video #pt9uHp35fwM" /><div class="play"><i class="icon icon-play"></i></div></div></a><div>Meetings Or Discipline; 26 April 2016.</div></aside><p>Thus, to achieve higher maintainability of the source code and robustness of the product, we must <strong>rotate</strong> programmers, preventing them from becoming subject matter experts.</p><p>I realize this idea sounds counter-intuitive, but think about it. By keeping people together, working on the same problem for a long time, we put a lot of knowledge into their heads, not our source code. These people become the <strong>asset</strong>. They become smarter, they know the solution very well, and they solve all issues rather quickly. But the code base degrades.</p><p>When the time comes to change someone (for any reason), the loss will be damaging. We may lose significant knowledge, and the code base left behind will be unmaintainable. In most cases, we will have to re-write it. That’s why in most software teams, management is <strong>afraid</strong> of programmers.

It’s a must read for every software engineer, in my opinion. There’s no need for me to repeat what it says, but there are a few very simple and very typical mistakes we keep making in our specs. I see them in our documents again and again, which is why I’ve decided to summarize them. So here they are, the ten most critical and typical of them, from the point of view of a programmer reading a specification document.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;!--more--&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;jb_picture&quot;&gt;&lt;img itemprop=&quot;image&quot; alt=&quot;Reservoir Dogs (1992) by Quentin Tarantino&quot; src=&quot;/images/2015/11/reservoir-dogs.jpg&quot; longdesc=&quot;#5dec8d1d&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption id=&quot;5dec8d1d&quot;&gt;Reservoir Dogs (1992) by Quentin Tarantino&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Chapter 4.3 of a famous standard &lt;a href=&quot;https://standards.ieee.org/findstds/standard/830-1998.html&quot;&gt;IEEE 830-1998&lt;/a&gt; says that a good &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_requirements_specification&quot;&gt;specification&lt;/a&gt; should be &lt;strong&gt;correct&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;unambiguous&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;complete&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;consistent&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;ranked&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;verifiable&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;modifiable&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;traceable&lt;/strong&gt;. Eight qualities in total. Then, the standard explains them one by one in pretty simple English. But do we have time to read those boring standards? They are for university professors and certification boards. We are practitioners, for goodness sake! … Hold on, I’m joking.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;badge&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://standards.ieee.org/findstds/standard/830-1998.html&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.yegor256.com/images/2015/11/ieee-830.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width:128px;max-width:100%;&quot; alt=&quot;badge&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;No matter how small the project is and how practical we are, there is always a document that explains what needs to be done, and it may be called the “software requirements specification,” or “specification,” or just “spec.” Of course, there is a lot of space for creativity, but we’re &lt;strong&gt;engineers&lt;/strong&gt;, not artists. We must follow rules and standards, mostly because they make our communication easier.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now, I’m getting to my point. The specs I usually see violate pretty much &lt;strong&gt;all&lt;/strong&gt; eight principles mentioned earlier. Below is a summary of how exactly they do it. By the way, all examples are taken from real documents in real commercial software projects.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;no-glossary-or-a-messy-one&quot;&gt;No Glossary or a Messy One&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;How about this:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;UUID is set incrementally to make sure there are no two users with the same account number.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;What is the difference between UUID and account number? Is it the same thing? It seems so, right? Or maybe they are different … it would be great to know what UUID stands for. Is it “unique user ID” or maybe “unified user identity descriptor?” I have no idea. I’m lost, and I want to find the author of this text and do something bad to him … or her.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;We're writing in order to be understood, not to impress the reader&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;I’ve written already that the &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/03/16/technical-glossaries.html&quot;&gt;worst technical specifications have no glossaries&lt;/a&gt;. In my experience, this is the biggest problem in all requirement documents. It’s not prose! It’s not a love letter! It’s technical documentation. We can’t juggle words for the sake of fun. We should not use product specs just to express ourselves. We’re writing in order to be understood, not to impress the reader. And the rule is the same here as with &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/06/29/simple-diagrams.html&quot;&gt;diagrams&lt;/a&gt;: if I don’t understand you, it’s your fault.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Here is how that text would look after a proper re-writing:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;UUID is user unique ID, a positive 4-bytes integer. UUID is set incrementally to make sure there are no two users with the same UUID.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Better now?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thus, the first and biggest problem is a frivolous use of terms and just words, without having them pre-defined in a glossary.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;questions-discussions-suggestions-opinions&quot;&gt;Questions, Discussions, Suggestions, Opinions&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;I’ve seen this very recently in a product spec:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;I believe that multiple versions of the API must be supported. What options do we have? I&amp;#39;d suggest we go with versioned URLs. Feel free to post your thoughts here.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Yes, this text exists verbatim in a requirements document. First, the author expresses his personal opinion about the subject. Then, the author asks me what possible options are out there. Then, he suggests I consider something, and after that, he invites me for a talk.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Find all your answers before writing the document, that's what you're paid for&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;Impressive, right? Obviously, the author has a very creative personality. But we should keep this person as far away from project documentation as possible. This is not what a requirements document appreciates. Well, we appreciate creativity, but these four things are strictly prohibited: questions, discussions, suggestions, and opinions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Specifications can’t have any &lt;strong&gt;questions&lt;/strong&gt; in them. Who are these questions addressed to? Me, a programmer? Am I supposed to implement the software or answer your questions? I’m not interested in brainstorming with you. I expect you, a requirements author, to tell me what needs to be done. Find all your answers before writing the document. That’s what you’re paid for. If you don’t have the answers, put something like TBD (“to be determined”) there. But don’t ask questions. It’s annoying.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A requirements document is not a &lt;strong&gt;discussion&lt;/strong&gt; board. As a reader of the spec, I expect to see exactly what needs to be done without any “maybe” or “we could do it differently.” Of course you need to discuss these issues, but do it before documenting it. Do it somewhere else, like in Skype, on Slack, or by email. If you really want to discuss in the document, use Google Docs or Word with version tracking. But when the discussion is over, remove its history from the document. Its presence only confuses me, a programmer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There’s no need to format requirements as &lt;strong&gt;suggestions&lt;/strong&gt; either. Just say what needs to be done and how the software has to work without fear of being wrong. Usually, people resort to suggestion when they are afraid to say it straight. Instead of saying “the app must work on Android 3.x and higher,” they say “I would suggest making the app compatible with Android 3.x and higher.” See the difference? In the second sentence, the author is trying to avoid personal responsibility. He’s not saying “exactly Android 3.x;” he’s just suggesting. Don’t be a coward; say it straight. If you make a mistake, we’ll correct you.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And, of course, &lt;strong&gt;opinions&lt;/strong&gt; are not appreciated at all. It’s not a letter to a friend; it’s a formal document that belongs to the project. In a few months or weeks, you may leave the project, and somebody else will work with your document. The spec is a contract between the project sponsor and project team. The opinion of a document author doesn’t make any difference here. Instead of noting “it seems Java would be faster” and suggesting “we should use it,” say “Java is faster, so we must use it.” Obviously you put it there because you thought so. But once it’s there, we don’t care who it came from and what you thought about this problem. The information would just confuse us more, so skip it. Just facts, no opinions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Don’t get me wrong, I’m not against creativity. Programmers are not robots, quietly implementing what the document says. But a messy document has nothing to do with creativity. If you want me to create, define the limits of that creativity and let me experiment within them; for example:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Multiple versions of the API must be supported. How exactly that is done doesn&amp;#39;t really matter.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is how you invite me to be creative. I realize that the user of the product doesn’t really have any justifications or expectations for the versioning mechanisms in the API. I’m free to do whatever I can. Great, I’ll do it my way.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But again, let me reiterate: A specification is not a discussion board.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;mixing-functional-and-quality-requirements&quot;&gt;Mixing Functional and Quality Requirements&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is how it looks:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;User must be able to scroll down through the list of images in the profile smoothly and fast.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s a typical mistake in almost every spec I’ve seen. Here, we mix together a functional requirement (“to scroll images”) and and a non-functional one (“scrolling is smooth and fast”). Why is it bad? Well, there is no specific reason, but it exhibits a lack of discipline.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Such a requirement is difficult to verify or test, difficult to trace, and difficult to implement. As a programmer, I don’t know what is more important: to scroll or to make sure the scrolling is fast.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Also, it is difficult to modify such a statement. If tomorrow we add another functional requirement—scrolling a list of friends, for example—we’ll want to require this scrolling to also be smooth and fast. Then, a few days later, we’ll want to say that “fast” means less than 10 milliseconds of reaction time. We’ll then have to duplicate this information in two places. See how messy our document may become eventually?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thus, I would strongly recommend you always document functional and non-functional requirements separately.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;mixing-requirements-and-supplementary-docs&quot;&gt;Mixing Requirements and Supplementary Docs&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is similar to a previous problem and may look like this:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;User can download a PDF report that includes a full list of transactions. Each transaction has ID, date, description, account, and full amount. The report also contains a summary and a link to the user account.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s obvious there are two things described in this paragraph. First is that a user can download a PDF report. Second is how this report should look. The first thing is a functional requirement, and the second one must be described in a supplementary document (or appendix).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In general, functional requirements must be very short: “user downloads,” “user saves,” “client requests and receives,” etc. If your text gets any longer, there is something wrong. Try to move part of it to a supplementary document.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;un-measurable-quality-requirements&quot;&gt;Un-measurable Quality Requirements&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is what I’m talking about:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Credit card numbers must be encrypted. The app should launch in less than 2 seconds. Each web page must open in less than 500 milliseconds. User interface must be responsive.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;I can find many more examples just by opening requirement specs in many projects I’ve seen over the past few years. They all look the same. And the problem is always the same: It is very difficult to define a truly testable and measurable non-functional requirement.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Yes, it’s difficult. Mostly because there are many factors. Take this line, for example: “The app must launch in 2 seconds.” On what equipment? With what amount of data in the user profile? What does “launch” mean; does it include profile loading time? What if there are launching problems? Do they count? There are a lot of questions like that.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If we answer &lt;strong&gt;all&lt;/strong&gt; of them, the requirement text will fill an entire page. Nobody wants that, but having un-measurable requirements is a greater evil.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Again, it’s not easy, but it’s necessary. Try to make sure all quality requirements are complete and without ambiguity.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;implementation-instructions&quot;&gt;Implementation Instructions&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;This example illustrates a very common pitfall:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;User authenticates via Facebook login button and we store username, avatar, and email in the database.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/09/22/micromanagement.html&quot;&gt;micromanagement&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s something a requirements analyst should never do to a programmer. You shouldn’t tell me how to implement the functionality you desire. You want to give a user the ability to login via Facebook? Say so. Do you really care whether it’s going to happen through a button click or somehow else? Do you really care what I store in the database? What if I use files instead of a database? Is that important to you?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I don’t think so. Only in very rare cases will it matter. Most of the time, it’s just micromanagement.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The spec should only require what really matters for the business. Everything else is up to us, the programmers. We decide what database to use, where the button will be placed, and what information will be stored in the database.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;You shouldn't tell me how to implement the functionality you desire&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you really care about that because there are certain higher-level limitations—say so. But again, not as implementation instructions to us programmers, but rather as non-functional requirements like this:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Login page must look like this (screenshot attached). We must store user email locally for future needs.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;The point is that I have nothing against requirements, but I’m strongly against implementation instructions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;lack-of-actor-perspective&quot;&gt;Lack of Actor Perspective&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The text may look like:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;PDF report is generated when required. It is possible to download a report or save it in the account.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;The problem here is that there is no “actor” involved. This functionality is more or less clear, but it’s not clear who is doing all this. Where is the user? It is just a story of something happening somewhere. That’s not really what programmers need in order to implement it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;A good user story always has, guess what ... a user&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;The best way to explain functionality is through user stories. And a good user story always has, guess what … a user. It always starts with “the user …,” followed by a verb. The user downloads, the user saves, the user clicks, prints, deletes, formats, etc.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s not necessary for the user to be a human. It may be a system, a RESTful API client, a database, anything. But always someone. “It is possible to download …” is not a user story. It’s possible for who?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;noise&quot;&gt;Noise&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;How about this:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Our primary concern is performance and an attractive user interface.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is noise. As the reader of this document, I’m neither an investor nor a user. I’m a programmer. I don’t care what your “primary concern” is in this project. My job is to implement the product so that it matches the specs. If performance is your primary concern, create measurable and testable requirements for me. I will make sure the product satisfies them. If you can’t create a requirement, don’t spam me with this irrelevant information.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Good programmers should figure out what good performance means, right?&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;I don’t want to share your concerns, your beliefs, or your intentions. That’s your business. And you’re paid to properly and unambiguously translate all that into testable and measurable requirements. If you can’t do this, it’s your problem and &lt;strong&gt;your fault&lt;/strong&gt;. Don’t try to make it mine.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Very often … wait. Very, very often. No. Almost always. Wrong again. Always! That’s right, spec documents are always full of noise. Some of them have a bit less; some have more. I believe this is a symptom of &lt;strong&gt;lazy&lt;/strong&gt; and unprofessional document authors. In most cases, just lazy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They don’t want to think and translate their concerns, ideas, thoughts, intentions, and objectives into functional and non-functional requirements. They just put them into the document and hope the programmers will somehow find the right solution. Good programmers should figure out what good performance means, right? Let’s just tell them that performance is a concern for us, and they will figure something out.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;No! Don’t do that. Do your job right and let programmers do theirs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And we, programmers, should never accept such documents. We should just reject them and ask requirements authors to re-work and remove noise. I would recommend not even starting to work on a product if there is a lot of noise in its specs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;will-work-needs-to-work-must-work&quot;&gt;Will Work, Needs to Work, Must Work&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is yet another very typical mistake:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;The API will support JSON and XML. Both formats must fully support all data items. XML needs to be validated by XSD schema.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;See how messy it sounds? There are three different points of view, and none of them are suitable for a specification document. A spec must describe a product as if it already exists. A spec must sound like a manual, a tutorial, or a reference. This text must be re-written like this:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;The API supports JSON and XML. Both formats fully support all data items. XML is validated by XSD schema.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;See the difference? All the “must,” “need,” and “will” words are just adding doubt to the document. For a reader of this spec, “&lt;em&gt;the API will support&lt;/em&gt;” sounds like “&lt;em&gt;some time in the future, maybe in the next version, it will support&lt;/em&gt;.” This is not what the author had in mind, right? There should be no doubt, no double meaning, no maybe. The API supports. That’s it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;hr /&gt; &lt;p&gt;I may have forgotten something important, but these issues are so obvious and so annoying … I’m going to use this post as a simple guide for our system analysts.

It’s a must read for every software engineer, in my opinion. There’s no need for me to repeat what it says, but there are a few very simple and very typical mistakes we keep making in our specs. I see them in our documents again and again, which is why I’ve decided to summarize them. So here they are, the ten most critical and typical of them, from the point of view of a programmer reading a specification document.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;!--more--&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;jb_picture&quot;&gt;&lt;img itemprop=&quot;image&quot; alt=&quot;Reservoir Dogs (1992) by Quentin Tarantino&quot; src=&quot;/images/2015/11/reservoir-dogs.jpg&quot; longdesc=&quot;#5dec8d1d&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption id=&quot;5dec8d1d&quot;&gt;Reservoir Dogs (1992) by Quentin Tarantino&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Chapter 4.3 of a famous standard &lt;a href=&quot;https://standards.ieee.org/findstds/standard/830-1998.html&quot;&gt;IEEE 830-1998&lt;/a&gt; says that a good &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_requirements_specification&quot;&gt;specification&lt;/a&gt; should be &lt;strong&gt;correct&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;unambiguous&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;complete&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;consistent&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;ranked&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;verifiable&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;modifiable&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;traceable&lt;/strong&gt;. Eight qualities in total. Then, the standard explains them one by one in pretty simple English. But do we have time to read those boring standards? They are for university professors and certification boards. We are practitioners, for goodness sake! … Hold on, I’m joking.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;badge&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://standards.ieee.org/findstds/standard/830-1998.html&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.yegor256.com/images/2015/11/ieee-830.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width:128px;max-width:100%;&quot; alt=&quot;badge&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;No matter how small the project is and how practical we are, there is always a document that explains what needs to be done, and it may be called the “software requirements specification,” or “specification,” or just “spec.” Of course, there is a lot of space for creativity, but we’re &lt;strong&gt;engineers&lt;/strong&gt;, not artists. We must follow rules and standards, mostly because they make our communication easier.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now, I’m getting to my point. The specs I usually see violate pretty much &lt;strong&gt;all&lt;/strong&gt; eight principles mentioned earlier. Below is a summary of how exactly they do it. By the way, all examples are taken from real documents in real commercial software projects.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;no-glossary-or-a-messy-one&quot;&gt;No Glossary or a Messy One&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;How about this:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;UUID is set incrementally to make sure there are no two users with the same account number.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;What is the difference between UUID and account number? Is it the same thing? It seems so, right? Or maybe they are different … it would be great to know what UUID stands for. Is it “unique user ID” or maybe “unified user identity descriptor?” I have no idea. I’m lost, and I want to find the author of this text and do something bad to him … or her.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;We're writing in order to be understood, not to impress the reader&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;I’ve written already that the &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/03/16/technical-glossaries.html&quot;&gt;worst technical specifications have no glossaries&lt;/a&gt;. In my experience, this is the biggest problem in all requirement documents. It’s not prose! It’s not a love letter! It’s technical documentation. We can’t juggle words for the sake of fun. We should not use product specs just to express ourselves. We’re writing in order to be understood, not to impress the reader. And the rule is the same here as with &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/06/29/simple-diagrams.html&quot;&gt;diagrams&lt;/a&gt;: if I don’t understand you, it’s your fault.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Here is how that text would look after a proper re-writing:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;UUID is user unique ID, a positive 4-bytes integer. UUID is set incrementally to make sure there are no two users with the same UUID.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Better now?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thus, the first and biggest problem is a frivolous use of terms and just words, without having them pre-defined in a glossary.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;questions-discussions-suggestions-opinions&quot;&gt;Questions, Discussions, Suggestions, Opinions&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;I’ve seen this very recently in a product spec:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;I believe that multiple versions of the API must be supported. What options do we have? I&amp;#39;d suggest we go with versioned URLs. Feel free to post your thoughts here.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Yes, this text exists verbatim in a requirements document. First, the author expresses his personal opinion about the subject. Then, the author asks me what possible options are out there. Then, he suggests I consider something, and after that, he invites me for a talk.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Find all your answers before writing the document, that's what you're paid for&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;Impressive, right? Obviously, the author has a very creative personality. But we should keep this person as far away from project documentation as possible. This is not what a requirements document appreciates. Well, we appreciate creativity, but these four things are strictly prohibited: questions, discussions, suggestions, and opinions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Specifications can’t have any &lt;strong&gt;questions&lt;/strong&gt; in them. Who are these questions addressed to? Me, a programmer? Am I supposed to implement the software or answer your questions? I’m not interested in brainstorming with you. I expect you, a requirements author, to tell me what needs to be done. Find all your answers before writing the document. That’s what you’re paid for. If you don’t have the answers, put something like TBD (“to be determined”) there. But don’t ask questions. It’s annoying.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A requirements document is not a &lt;strong&gt;discussion&lt;/strong&gt; board. As a reader of the spec, I expect to see exactly what needs to be done without any “maybe” or “we could do it differently.” Of course you need to discuss these issues, but do it before documenting it. Do it somewhere else, like in Skype, on Slack, or by email. If you really want to discuss in the document, use Google Docs or Word with version tracking. But when the discussion is over, remove its history from the document. Its presence only confuses me, a programmer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There’s no need to format requirements as &lt;strong&gt;suggestions&lt;/strong&gt; either. Just say what needs to be done and how the software has to work without fear of being wrong. Usually, people resort to suggestion when they are afraid to say it straight. Instead of saying “the app must work on Android 3.x and higher,” they say “I would suggest making the app compatible with Android 3.x and higher.” See the difference? In the second sentence, the author is trying to avoid personal responsibility. He’s not saying “exactly Android 3.x;” he’s just suggesting. Don’t be a coward; say it straight. If you make a mistake, we’ll correct you.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And, of course, &lt;strong&gt;opinions&lt;/strong&gt; are not appreciated at all. It’s not a letter to a friend; it’s a formal document that belongs to the project. In a few months or weeks, you may leave the project, and somebody else will work with your document. The spec is a contract between the project sponsor and project team. The opinion of a document author doesn’t make any difference here. Instead of noting “it seems Java would be faster” and suggesting “we should use it,” say “Java is faster, so we must use it.” Obviously you put it there because you thought so. But once it’s there, we don’t care who it came from and what you thought about this problem. The information would just confuse us more, so skip it. Just facts, no opinions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Don’t get me wrong, I’m not against creativity. Programmers are not robots, quietly implementing what the document says. But a messy document has nothing to do with creativity. If you want me to create, define the limits of that creativity and let me experiment within them; for example:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Multiple versions of the API must be supported. How exactly that is done doesn&amp;#39;t really matter.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is how you invite me to be creative. I realize that the user of the product doesn’t really have any justifications or expectations for the versioning mechanisms in the API. I’m free to do whatever I can. Great, I’ll do it my way.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But again, let me reiterate: A specification is not a discussion board.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;mixing-functional-and-quality-requirements&quot;&gt;Mixing Functional and Quality Requirements&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is how it looks:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;User must be able to scroll down through the list of images in the profile smoothly and fast.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s a typical mistake in almost every spec I’ve seen. Here, we mix together a functional requirement (“to scroll images”) and and a non-functional one (“scrolling is smooth and fast”). Why is it bad? Well, there is no specific reason, but it exhibits a lack of discipline.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Such a requirement is difficult to verify or test, difficult to trace, and difficult to implement. As a programmer, I don’t know what is more important: to scroll or to make sure the scrolling is fast.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Also, it is difficult to modify such a statement. If tomorrow we add another functional requirement—scrolling a list of friends, for example—we’ll want to require this scrolling to also be smooth and fast. Then, a few days later, we’ll want to say that “fast” means less than 10 milliseconds of reaction time. We’ll then have to duplicate this information in two places. See how messy our document may become eventually?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thus, I would strongly recommend you always document functional and non-functional requirements separately.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;mixing-requirements-and-supplementary-docs&quot;&gt;Mixing Requirements and Supplementary Docs&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is similar to a previous problem and may look like this:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;User can download a PDF report that includes a full list of transactions. Each transaction has ID, date, description, account, and full amount. The report also contains a summary and a link to the user account.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s obvious there are two things described in this paragraph. First is that a user can download a PDF report. Second is how this report should look. The first thing is a functional requirement, and the second one must be described in a supplementary document (or appendix).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In general, functional requirements must be very short: “user downloads,” “user saves,” “client requests and receives,” etc. If your text gets any longer, there is something wrong. Try to move part of it to a supplementary document.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;un-measurable-quality-requirements&quot;&gt;Un-measurable Quality Requirements&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is what I’m talking about:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Credit card numbers must be encrypted. The app should launch in less than 2 seconds. Each web page must open in less than 500 milliseconds. User interface must be responsive.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;I can find many more examples just by opening requirement specs in many projects I’ve seen over the past few years. They all look the same. And the problem is always the same: It is very difficult to define a truly testable and measurable non-functional requirement.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Yes, it’s difficult. Mostly because there are many factors. Take this line, for example: “The app must launch in 2 seconds.” On what equipment? With what amount of data in the user profile? What does “launch” mean; does it include profile loading time? What if there are launching problems? Do they count? There are a lot of questions like that.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If we answer &lt;strong&gt;all&lt;/strong&gt; of them, the requirement text will fill an entire page. Nobody wants that, but having un-measurable requirements is a greater evil.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Again, it’s not easy, but it’s necessary. Try to make sure all quality requirements are complete and without ambiguity.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;implementation-instructions&quot;&gt;Implementation Instructions&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;This example illustrates a very common pitfall:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;User authenticates via Facebook login button and we store username, avatar, and email in the database.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/09/22/micromanagement.html&quot;&gt;micromanagement&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s something a requirements analyst should never do to a programmer. You shouldn’t tell me how to implement the functionality you desire. You want to give a user the ability to login via Facebook? Say so. Do you really care whether it’s going to happen through a button click or somehow else? Do you really care what I store in the database? What if I use files instead of a database? Is that important to you?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I don’t think so. Only in very rare cases will it matter. Most of the time, it’s just micromanagement.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The spec should only require what really matters for the business. Everything else is up to us, the programmers. We decide what database to use, where the button will be placed, and what information will be stored in the database.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;You shouldn't tell me how to implement the functionality you desire&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you really care about that because there are certain higher-level limitations—say so. But again, not as implementation instructions to us programmers, but rather as non-functional requirements like this:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Login page must look like this (screenshot attached). We must store user email locally for future needs.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;The point is that I have nothing against requirements, but I’m strongly against implementation instructions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;lack-of-actor-perspective&quot;&gt;Lack of Actor Perspective&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The text may look like:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;PDF report is generated when required. It is possible to download a report or save it in the account.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;The problem here is that there is no “actor” involved. This functionality is more or less clear, but it’s not clear who is doing all this. Where is the user? It is just a story of something happening somewhere. That’s not really what programmers need in order to implement it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;A good user story always has, guess what ... a user&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;The best way to explain functionality is through user stories. And a good user story always has, guess what … a user. It always starts with “the user …,” followed by a verb. The user downloads, the user saves, the user clicks, prints, deletes, formats, etc.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s not necessary for the user to be a human. It may be a system, a RESTful API client, a database, anything. But always someone. “It is possible to download …” is not a user story. It’s possible for who?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;noise&quot;&gt;Noise&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;How about this:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Our primary concern is performance and an attractive user interface.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is noise. As the reader of this document, I’m neither an investor nor a user. I’m a programmer. I don’t care what your “primary concern” is in this project. My job is to implement the product so that it matches the specs. If performance is your primary concern, create measurable and testable requirements for me. I will make sure the product satisfies them. If you can’t create a requirement, don’t spam me with this irrelevant information.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Good programmers should figure out what good performance means, right?&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;I don’t want to share your concerns, your beliefs, or your intentions. That’s your business. And you’re paid to properly and unambiguously translate all that into testable and measurable requirements. If you can’t do this, it’s your problem and &lt;strong&gt;your fault&lt;/strong&gt;. Don’t try to make it mine.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Very often … wait. Very, very often. No. Almost always. Wrong again. Always! That’s right, spec documents are always full of noise. Some of them have a bit less; some have more. I believe this is a symptom of &lt;strong&gt;lazy&lt;/strong&gt; and unprofessional document authors. In most cases, just lazy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They don’t want to think and translate their concerns, ideas, thoughts, intentions, and objectives into functional and non-functional requirements. They just put them into the document and hope the programmers will somehow find the right solution. Good programmers should figure out what good performance means, right? Let’s just tell them that performance is a concern for us, and they will figure something out.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;No! Don’t do that. Do your job right and let programmers do theirs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And we, programmers, should never accept such documents. We should just reject them and ask requirements authors to re-work and remove noise. I would recommend not even starting to work on a product if there is a lot of noise in its specs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;will-work-needs-to-work-must-work&quot;&gt;Will Work, Needs to Work, Must Work&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is yet another very typical mistake:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;The API will support JSON and XML. Both formats must fully support all data items. XML needs to be validated by XSD schema.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;See how messy it sounds? There are three different points of view, and none of them are suitable for a specification document. A spec must describe a product as if it already exists. A spec must sound like a manual, a tutorial, or a reference. This text must be re-written like this:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;The API supports JSON and XML. Both formats fully support all data items. XML is validated by XSD schema.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;See the difference? All the “must,” “need,” and “will” words are just adding doubt to the document. For a reader of this spec, “&lt;em&gt;the API will support&lt;/em&gt;” sounds like “&lt;em&gt;some time in the future, maybe in the next version, it will support&lt;/em&gt;.” This is not what the author had in mind, right? There should be no doubt, no double meaning, no maybe. The API supports. That’s it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;hr /&gt; &lt;p&gt;I may have forgotten something important, but these issues are so obvious and so annoying … I’m going to use this post as a simple guide for our system analysts.

href="http://amzn.to/2c5n12h">Software Requirements</a> written by Karl Wiegers about, well, software requirements. It’s a must read for every software engineer, in my opinion. There’s no need for me to repeat what it says, but there are a few very simple and very typical mistakes we keep making in our specs. I see them in our documents again and again, which is why I’ve decided to summarize them. So here they are, the ten most critical and typical of them, from the point of view of a programmer reading a specification document.</p><figure class="jb_picture"><img itemprop="image" alt="Reservoir Dogs (1992) by Quentin Tarantino" src="/images/2015/11/reservoir-dogs.jpg" longdesc="#5dec8d1d" /><figcaption id="5dec8d1d">Reservoir Dogs (1992) by Quentin Tarantino</figcaption></figure><p>Chapter 4.3 of a famous standard <a href="https://standards.ieee.org/findstds/standard/830-1998.html">IEEE 830-1998</a> says that a good <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_requirements_specification">specification</a> should be <strong>correct</strong>, <strong>unambiguous</strong>, <strong>complete</strong>, <strong>consistent</strong>, <strong>ranked</strong>, <strong>verifiable</strong>, <strong>modifiable</strong>, and <strong>traceable</strong>. Eight qualities in total. Then, the standard explains them one by one in pretty simple English. But do we have time to read those boring standards? They are for university professors and certification boards. We are practitioners, for goodness sake! … Hold on, I’m joking.</p><figure class="badge"><a href="https://standards.ieee.org/findstds/standard/830-1998.html"><img src="https://www.yegor256.com/images/2015/11/ieee-830.jpg" style="width:128px;max-width:100%;" alt="badge" /></a></figure><p>No matter how small the project is and how practical we are, there is always a document that explains what needs to be done, and it may be called the “software requirements specification,” or “specification,” or just “spec.” Of course, there is a lot of space for creativity, but we’re <strong>engineers</strong>, not artists. We must follow rules and standards, mostly because they make our communication easier.</p><p>Now, I’m getting to my point. The specs I usually see violate pretty much <strong>all</strong> eight principles mentioned earlier. Below is a summary of how exactly they do it. By the way, all examples are taken from real documents in real commercial software projects.</p><h2 id="no-glossary-or-a-messy-one">No Glossary or a Messy One</h2><p>How about this:</p><figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text"><span></span>UUID is set incrementally to make sure there
are no two users with the same account number.</code></pre></figure><p>What is the difference between UUID and account number? Is it the same thing? It seems so, right? Or maybe they are different … it would be great to know what UUID stands for. Is it “unique user ID” or maybe “unified user identity descriptor?” I have no idea. I’m lost, and I want to find the author of this text and do something bad to him … or her.</p><aside class="quote">We're writing in order to be understood, not to impress the reader</aside><p>I’ve written already that the <a href="/2015/03/16/technical-glossaries.html">worst technical specifications have no glossaries</a>. In my experience, this is the biggest problem in all requirement documents. It’s not prose! It’s not a love letter! It’s technical documentation. We can’t juggle words for the sake of fun. We should not use product specs just to express ourselves. We’re writing in order to be understood, not to impress the reader. And the rule is the same here as with <a href="/2015/06/29/simple-diagrams.html">diagrams</a>: if I don’t understand you, it’s your fault.</p><p>Here is how that text would look after a proper re-writing:</p><figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text"><span></span>UUID is user unique ID, a positive 4-bytes integer.
UUID is set incrementally to make sure there
are no two users with the same UUID.</code></pre></figure><p>Better now?</p><p>Thus, the first and biggest problem is a frivolous use of terms and just words, without having them pre-defined in a glossary.</p><h2 id="questions-discussions-suggestions-opinions">Questions, Discussions, Suggestions, Opinions</h2><p>I’ve seen this very recently in a product spec:</p><figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text"><span></span>I believe that multiple versions of the API
must be supported. What options do we have? I&#39;d
suggest we go with versioned URLs. Feel free to
post your thoughts here.</code></pre></figure><p>Yes, this text exists verbatim in a requirements document. First, the author expresses his personal opinion about the subject. Then, the author asks me what possible options are out there. Then, he suggests I consider something, and after that, he invites me for a talk.</p><aside class="quote">Find all your answers before writing the document, that's what you're paid for</aside><p>Impressive, right? Obviously, the author has a very creative personality. But we should keep this person as far away from project documentation as possible. This is not what a requirements document appreciates. Well, we appreciate creativity, but these four things are strictly prohibited: questions, discussions, suggestions, and opinions.</p><p>Specifications can’t have any <strong>questions</strong> in them. Who are these questions addressed to? Me, a programmer? Am I supposed to implement the software or answer your questions? I’m not interested in brainstorming with you. I expect you, a requirements author, to tell me what needs to be done. Find all your answers before writing the document. That’s what you’re paid for. If you don’t have the answers, put something like TBD (“to be determined”) there. But don’t ask questions. It’s annoying.</p><p>A requirements document is not a <strong>discussion</strong> board. As a reader of the spec, I expect to see exactly what needs to be done without any “maybe” or “we could do it differently.” Of course you need to discuss these issues, but do it before documenting it. Do it somewhere else, like in Skype, on Slack, or by email. If you really want to discuss in the document, use Google Docs or Word with version tracking. But when the discussion is over, remove its history from the document. Its presence only confuses me, a programmer.</p><p>There’s no need to format requirements as <strong>suggestions</strong> either. Just say what needs to be done and how the software has to work without fear of being wrong. Usually, people resort to suggestion when they are afraid to say it straight. Instead of saying “the app must work on Android 3.x and higher,” they say “I would suggest making the app compatible with Android 3.x and higher.” See the difference? In the second sentence, the author is trying to avoid personal responsibility. He’s not saying “exactly Android 3.x;” he’s just suggesting. Don’t be a coward; say it straight. If you make a mistake, we’ll correct you.</p><p>And, of course, <strong>opinions</strong> are not appreciated at all. It’s not a letter to a friend; it’s a formal document that belongs to the project. In a few months or weeks, you may leave the project, and somebody else will work with your document. The spec is a contract between the project sponsor and project team. The opinion of a document author doesn’t make any difference here. Instead of noting “it seems Java would be faster” and suggesting “we should use it,” say “Java is faster, so we must use it.” Obviously you put it there because you thought so. But once it’s there, we don’t care who it came from and what you thought about this problem. The information would just confuse us more, so skip it. Just facts, no opinions.</p><p>Don’t get me wrong, I’m not against creativity. Programmers are not robots, quietly implementing what the document says. But a messy document has nothing to do with creativity. If you want me to create, define the limits of that creativity and let me experiment within them; for example:</p><figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text"><span></span>Multiple versions of the API must be supported. How exactly
that is done doesn&#39;t really matter.</code></pre></figure><p>This is how you invite me to be creative. I realize that the user of the product doesn’t really have any justifications or expectations for the versioning mechanisms in the API. I’m free to do whatever I can. Great, I’ll do it my way.</p><p>But again, let me reiterate: A specification is not a discussion board.</p><h2 id="mixing-functional-and-quality-requirements">Mixing Functional and Quality Requirements</h2><p>This is how it looks:</p><figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text"><span></span>User must be able to scroll down through
the list of images in the profile smoothly and fast.</code></pre></figure><p>It’s a typical mistake in almost every spec I’ve seen. Here, we mix together a functional requirement (“to scroll images”) and and a non-functional one (“scrolling is smooth and fast”). Why is it bad? Well, there is no specific reason, but it exhibits a lack of discipline.</p><p>Such a requirement is difficult to verify or test, difficult to trace, and difficult to implement. As a programmer, I don’t know what is more important: to scroll or to make sure the scrolling is fast.</p><p>Also, it is difficult to modify such a statement. If tomorrow we add another functional requirement—scrolling a list of friends, for example—we’ll want to require this scrolling to also be smooth and fast. Then, a few days later, we’ll want to say that “fast” means less than 10 milliseconds of reaction time. We’ll then have to duplicate this information in two places. See how messy our document may become eventually?</p><p>Thus, I would strongly recommend you always document functional and non-functional requirements separately.</p><h2 id="mixing-requirements-and-supplementary-docs">Mixing Requirements and Supplementary Docs</h2><p>This is similar to a previous problem and may look like this:</p><figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text"><span></span>User can download a PDF report that includes a full
list of transactions. Each transaction has ID,
date, description, account, and full amount. The report
also contains a summary and a link to the user account.</code></pre></figure><p>It’s obvious there are two things described in this paragraph. First is that a user can download a PDF report. Second is how this report should look. The first thing is a functional requirement, and the second one must be described in a supplementary document (or appendix).</p><p>In general, functional requirements must be very short: “user downloads,” “user saves,” “client requests and receives,” etc. If your text gets any longer, there is something wrong. Try to move part of it to a supplementary document.</p><h2 id="un-measurable-quality-requirements">Un-measurable Quality Requirements</h2><p>This is what I’m talking about:</p><figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text"><span></span>Credit card numbers must be encrypted.
The app should launch in less than 2 seconds.
Each web page must open in less than 500 milliseconds.
User interface must be responsive.</code></pre></figure><p>I can find many more examples just by opening requirement specs in many projects I’ve seen over the past few years. They all look the same. And the problem is always the same: It is very difficult to define a truly testable and measurable non-functional requirement.</p><p>Yes, it’s difficult. Mostly because there are many factors. Take this line, for example: “The app must launch in 2 seconds.” On what equipment? With what amount of data in the user profile? What does “launch” mean; does it include profile loading time? What if there are launching problems? Do they count? There are a lot of questions like that.</p><p>If we answer <strong>all</strong> of them, the requirement text will fill an entire page. Nobody wants that, but having un-measurable requirements is a greater evil.</p><p>Again, it’s not easy, but it’s necessary. Try to make sure all quality requirements are complete and without ambiguity.</p><h2 id="implementation-instructions">Implementation Instructions</h2><p>This example illustrates a very common pitfall:</p><figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text"><span></span>User authenticates via Facebook login button
and we store username, avatar, and email in the
database.</code></pre></figure><p>This is <a href="/2015/09/22/micromanagement.html">micromanagement</a>, and it’s something a requirements analyst should never do to a programmer. You shouldn’t tell me how to implement the functionality you desire. You want to give a user the ability to login via Facebook? Say so. Do you really care whether it’s going to happen through a button click or somehow else? Do you really care what I store in the database? What if I use files instead of a database?

It’s a must read for every software engineer, in my opinion. There’s no need for me to repeat what it says, but there are a few very simple and very typical mistakes we keep making in our specs. I see them in our documents again and again, which is why I’ve decided to summarize them. So here they are, the ten most critical and typical of them, from the point of view of a programmer reading a specification document.</p><figure class="jb_picture"><img itemprop="image" alt="Reservoir Dogs (1992) by Quentin Tarantino" src="/images/2015/11/reservoir-dogs.jpg" longdesc="#5dec8d1d" /><figcaption id="5dec8d1d">Reservoir Dogs (1992) by Quentin Tarantino</figcaption></figure><p>Chapter 4.3 of a famous standard <a href="https://standards.ieee.org/findstds/standard/830-1998.html">IEEE 830-1998</a> says that a good <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_requirements_specification">specification</a> should be <strong>correct</strong>, <strong>unambiguous</strong>, <strong>complete</strong>, <strong>consistent</strong>, <strong>ranked</strong>, <strong>verifiable</strong>, <strong>modifiable</strong>, and <strong>traceable</strong>. Eight qualities in total. Then, the standard explains them one by one in pretty simple English. But do we have time to read those boring standards? They are for university professors and certification boards. We are practitioners, for goodness sake! … Hold on, I’m joking.</p><figure class="badge"><a href="https://standards.ieee.org/findstds/standard/830-1998.html"><img src="https://www.yegor256.com/images/2015/11/ieee-830.jpg" style="width:128px;max-width:100%;" alt="badge" /></a></figure><p>No matter how small the project is and how practical we are, there is always a document that explains what needs to be done, and it may be called the “software requirements specification,” or “specification,” or just “spec.” Of course, there is a lot of space for creativity, but we’re <strong>engineers</strong>, not artists. We must follow rules and standards, mostly because they make our communication easier.</p><p>Now, I’m getting to my point. The specs I usually see violate pretty much <strong>all</strong> eight principles mentioned earlier. Below is a summary of how exactly they do it. By the way, all examples are taken from real documents in real commercial software projects.</p><h2 id="no-glossary-or-a-messy-one">No Glossary or a Messy One</h2><p>How about this:</p><figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text"><span></span>UUID is set incrementally to make sure there
are no two users with the same account number.</code></pre></figure><p>What is the difference between UUID and account number? Is it the same thing? It seems so, right? Or maybe they are different … it would be great to know what UUID stands for. Is it “unique user ID” or maybe “unified user identity descriptor?” I have no idea. I’m lost, and I want to find the author of this text and do something bad to him … or her.</p><aside class="quote">We're writing in order to be understood, not to impress the reader</aside><p>I’ve written already that the <a href="/2015/03/16/technical-glossaries.html">worst technical specifications have no glossaries</a>. In my experience, this is the biggest problem in all requirement documents. It’s not prose! It’s not a love letter! It’s technical documentation. We can’t juggle words for the sake of fun. We should not use product specs just to express ourselves. We’re writing in order to be understood, not to impress the reader. And the rule is the same here as with <a href="/2015/06/29/simple-diagrams.html">diagrams</a>: if I don’t understand you, it’s your fault.</p><p>Here is how that text would look after a proper re-writing:</p><figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text"><span></span>UUID is user unique ID, a positive 4-bytes integer.
UUID is set incrementally to make sure there
are no two users with the same UUID.</code></pre></figure><p>Better now?</p><p>Thus, the first and biggest problem is a frivolous use of terms and just words, without having them pre-defined in a glossary.</p><h2 id="questions-discussions-suggestions-opinions">Questions, Discussions, Suggestions, Opinions</h2><p>I’ve seen this very recently in a product spec:</p><figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text"><span></span>I believe that multiple versions of the API
must be supported. What options do we have? I&#39;d
suggest we go with versioned URLs. Feel free to
post your thoughts here.</code></pre></figure><p>Yes, this text exists verbatim in a requirements document. First, the author expresses his personal opinion about the subject. Then, the author asks me what possible options are out there. Then, he suggests I consider something, and after that, he invites me for a talk.</p><aside class="quote">Find all your answers before writing the document, that's what you're paid for</aside><p>Impressive, right? Obviously, the author has a very creative personality. But we should keep this person as far away from project documentation as possible. This is not what a requirements document appreciates. Well, we appreciate creativity, but these four things are strictly prohibited: questions, discussions, suggestions, and opinions.</p><p>Specifications can’t have any <strong>questions</strong> in them. Who are these questions addressed to? Me, a programmer? Am I supposed to implement the software or answer your questions? I’m not interested in brainstorming with you. I expect you, a requirements author, to tell me what needs to be done. Find all your answers before writing the document. That’s what you’re paid for. If you don’t have the answers, put something like TBD (“to be determined”) there. But don’t ask questions. It’s annoying.</p><p>A requirements document is not a <strong>discussion</strong> board. As a reader of the spec, I expect to see exactly what needs to be done without any “maybe” or “we could do it differently.” Of course you need to discuss these issues, but do it before documenting it. Do it somewhere else, like in Skype, on Slack, or by email. If you really want to discuss in the document, use Google Docs or Word with version tracking. But when the discussion is over, remove its history from the document. Its presence only confuses me, a programmer.</p><p>There’s no need to format requirements as <strong>suggestions</strong> either. Just say what needs to be done and how the software has to work without fear of being wrong. Usually, people resort to suggestion when they are afraid to say it straight. Instead of saying “the app must work on Android 3.x and higher,” they say “I would suggest making the app compatible with Android 3.x and higher.” See the difference? In the second sentence, the author is trying to avoid personal responsibility. He’s not saying “exactly Android 3.x;” he’s just suggesting. Don’t be a coward; say it straight. If you make a mistake, we’ll correct you.</p><p>And, of course, <strong>opinions</strong> are not appreciated at all. It’s not a letter to a friend; it’s a formal document that belongs to the project. In a few months or weeks, you may leave the project, and somebody else will work with your document. The spec is a contract between the project sponsor and project team. The opinion of a document author doesn’t make any difference here. Instead of noting “it seems Java would be faster” and suggesting “we should use it,” say “Java is faster, so we must use it.” Obviously you put it there because you thought so. But once it’s there, we don’t care who it came from and what you thought about this problem. The information would just confuse us more, so skip it. Just facts, no opinions.</p><p>Don’t get me wrong, I’m not against creativity. Programmers are not robots, quietly implementing what the document says. But a messy document has nothing to do with creativity. If you want me to create, define the limits of that creativity and let me experiment within them; for example:</p><figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text"><span></span>Multiple versions of the API must be supported. How exactly
that is done doesn&#39;t really matter.</code></pre></figure><p>This is how you invite me to be creative. I realize that the user of the product doesn’t really have any justifications or expectations for the versioning mechanisms in the API. I’m free to do whatever I can. Great, I’ll do it my way.</p><p>But again, let me reiterate: A specification is not a discussion board.</p><h2 id="mixing-functional-and-quality-requirements">Mixing Functional and Quality Requirements</h2><p>This is how it looks:</p><figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text"><span></span>User must be able to scroll down through
the list of images in the profile smoothly and fast.</code></pre></figure><p>It’s a typical mistake in almost every spec I’ve seen. Here, we mix together a functional requirement (“to scroll images”) and and a non-functional one (“scrolling is smooth and fast”). Why is it bad? Well, there is no specific reason, but it exhibits a lack of discipline.</p><p>Such a requirement is difficult to verify or test, difficult to trace, and difficult to implement. As a programmer, I don’t know what is more important: to scroll or to make sure the scrolling is fast.</p><p>Also, it is difficult to modify such a statement. If tomorrow we add another functional requirement—scrolling a list of friends, for example—we’ll want to require this scrolling to also be smooth and fast. Then, a few days later, we’ll want to say that “fast” means less than 10 milliseconds of reaction time. We’ll then have to duplicate this information in two places. See how messy our document may become eventually?</p><p>Thus, I would strongly recommend you always document functional and non-functional requirements separately.</p><h2 id="mixing-requirements-and-supplementary-docs">Mixing Requirements and Supplementary Docs</h2><p>This is similar to a previous problem and may look like this:</p><figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text"><span></span>User can download a PDF report that includes a full
list of transactions. Each transaction has ID,
date, description, account, and full amount. The report
also contains a summary and a link to the user account.</code></pre></figure><p>It’s obvious there are two things described in this paragraph. First is that a user can download a PDF report. Second is how this report should look. The first thing is a functional requirement, and the second one must be described in a supplementary document (or appendix).</p><p>In general, functional requirements must be very short: “user downloads,” “user saves,” “client requests and receives,” etc. If your text gets any longer, there is something wrong. Try to move part of it to a supplementary document.</p><h2 id="un-measurable-quality-requirements">Un-measurable Quality Requirements</h2><p>This is what I’m talking about:</p><figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text"><span></span>Credit card numbers must be encrypted.
The app should launch in less than 2 seconds.
Each web page must open in less than 500 milliseconds.
User interface must be responsive.</code></pre></figure><p>I can find many more examples just by opening requirement specs in many projects I’ve seen over the past few years. They all look the same. And the problem is always the same: It is very difficult to define a truly testable and measurable non-functional requirement.</p><p>Yes, it’s difficult. Mostly because there are many factors. Take this line, for example: “The app must launch in 2 seconds.” On what equipment? With what amount of data in the user profile? What does “launch” mean; does it include profile loading time? What if there are launching problems? Do they count? There are a lot of questions like that.</p><p>If we answer <strong>all</strong> of them, the requirement text will fill an entire page. Nobody wants that, but having un-measurable requirements is a greater evil.</p><p>Again, it’s not easy, but it’s necessary. Try to make sure all quality requirements are complete and without ambiguity.</p><h2 id="implementation-instructions">Implementation Instructions</h2><p>This example illustrates a very common pitfall:</p><figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text"><span></span>User authenticates via Facebook login button
and we store username, avatar, and email in the
database.</code></pre></figure><p>This is <a href="/2015/09/22/micromanagement.html">micromanagement</a>, and it’s something a requirements analyst should never do to a programmer. You shouldn’t tell me how to implement the functionality you desire. You want to give a user the ability to login via Facebook? Say so. Do you really care whether it’s going to happen through a button click or somehow else? Do you really care what I store in the database? What if I use files instead of a database? Is that important to you?</p><p>I don’t think so. Only in very rare cases will it matter. Most of the time, it’s just micromanagement.</p><p>The spec should only require what really matters for the business. Everything else is up to us, the programmers. We decide what database to use, where the button will be placed, and what information will be stored in the database.</p><aside class="quote">You shouldn't tell me how to implement the functionality you desire</aside><p>If you really care about that because there are certain higher-level limitations—say so.

It was shot in 1949, when &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stalin&quot;&gt;Joseph Stalin&lt;/a&gt; was in power, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union&quot;&gt;Soviet Union&lt;/a&gt; was literally broke, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II&quot;&gt;WWII&lt;/a&gt; brought people to the point of &lt;strong&gt;starvation&lt;/strong&gt;. However, the film showed something completely opposite—wealthy villages, rich peasants, and tables full of food.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It was &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propaganda&quot;&gt;propaganda&lt;/a&gt; in 1949.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But isn’t it quite similar to what I’ve just seen a few days ago, produced and directed in 2015 by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000631/&quot;&gt;Ridley Scott&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;badge&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.yegor256.com/images/2015/10/ussr-symbol.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width:128px;max-width:100%;&quot; alt=&quot;badge&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;In 1949, the goal of Soviet propaganda was to convince people that their personal situations with a lack of food and lack of future were just their local, personal &lt;strong&gt;exceptions&lt;/strong&gt; to a more general rule. And that rule was that the country was full of food. The country was governed by the principles of socialism, and they were working perfectly.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In 2015, the goal of Hollywood propaganda is to convince us that the organizational and motivational problems in our &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/10/06/how-to-be-good-office-slave.html&quot;&gt;offices&lt;/a&gt; are just local exceptions to the general rule. The rule is simple: project management is not important if we’re all good friends.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;The truth is that you are not going to get anywhere if you follow the spirit of this movie&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ridley Scott is telling us that in a perfect organization, such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nasa.gov/&quot;&gt;NASA&lt;/a&gt;, everybody &lt;strong&gt;loves&lt;/strong&gt; everyone; that’s why they can get a man from Mars without even a map. Do the same in your company and you will be fine. You don’t need risk planning, you just need a hero. Actually, you’d be better off with a couple of heroes who love each other.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That doesn’t work for you? It must be a problem with implementation. Keep trying and smiling.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Make friends, don’t make plans.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is a lie, very similar to the lie we heard in 1949.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The truth is that you are not going to get anywhere if you follow the spirit of this movie. In reality, teamwork must look completely different. There are &lt;a href=&quot;/2017/01/03/how-much-you-love-conflicts.html&quot;&gt;conflicts&lt;/a&gt;, fights, politics, betrayals, back-stabbing, leakage of information, and just primitive incompetence. To manage all this, one can’t just be a &lt;strong&gt;nice guy&lt;/strong&gt; with a big heart. I would even say that being a nice guy is a drawback for any management position in a modern organization. Well, in any organization at any time and in any place.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Project management is &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/03/02/team-morale-myths-and-reality.html&quot;&gt;not&lt;/a&gt; about compassion and sympathy. It is about accurate and routine comparison of risks, probabilities, impacts, and their mitigation plans. It is about &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/09/22/micromanagement.html&quot;&gt;setting rules&lt;/a&gt; and making &lt;strong&gt;decisions&lt;/strong&gt;. It is about making sure these decisions are being executed, precisely and without mistakes. It is about &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/09/16/how-to-fire-someone-right.html&quot;&gt;making sure&lt;/a&gt; those who’ve made mistakes are &lt;strong&gt;punished&lt;/strong&gt; while those who’ve done everything right are &lt;strong&gt;rewarded&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A team of six. In a multi-million-dollar spaceship. Flying to another planet to save one person. Against explicit instructions from upper management. They come back as national heroes. Are you serious?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Have you tried to deploy a new feature on a production server against the direct will of your boss? Try it. No spaceships, no Mars. Just a piece of code and a simple server. Then try to convince your boss that you’re a hero.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I’m sure you get the point.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;picture&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.popsci.com/sites/popsci.com/files/styles/large_1x_/public/psc1015_mt_088.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width:600px;max-width:100%;&quot; alt=&quot;Shooting The Martian (by popsci.com)&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Shooting The Martian (by popsci.com)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;So, why is Ridley Scott &lt;strong&gt;lying&lt;/strong&gt; to us? Why is he giving us a false picture of reality? Intentionally &lt;strong&gt;false&lt;/strong&gt;. He knows better than I do how real management works in real-life organizations. Hollywood is not much different than Silicon Valley in this aspect. So, why is he lying?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;badge&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Germany&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.yegor256.com/images/2015/10/third-reich-symbol.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width:128px;max-width:100%;&quot; alt=&quot;badge&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Why was &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Goebbels&quot;&gt;Joseph Goebbels&lt;/a&gt;, a minister of propaganda in the Third Reich, lying to the German people?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Because that’s what we like to hear, &lt;strong&gt;unfortunately&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is sad, but we don’t want to know the truth. We didn’t want to know about Nazi war crimes—so Joseph Goebbels built a &lt;strong&gt;fake&lt;/strong&gt; reality for us.

When one of your colleagues asks for a raise, who decides, and what is his or her decision based on? When it’s necessary to work overtime, how is it decided who will stay in the &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/10/06/how-to-be-good-office-slave.html&quot;&gt;office&lt;/a&gt;? I’m expecting you to shrug your shoulders. You’re right, these questions never have explicit answers in modern organizations. We are used to working in a more “&lt;a href=&quot;/2014/10/12/who-is-software-architect.html&quot;&gt;democratic&lt;/a&gt;” way, where such decisions are made &lt;em&gt;subjectively&lt;/em&gt; by managers or more senior employees. Is this how it should be?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;!--more--&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;jb_picture&quot;&gt;&lt;img itemprop=&quot;image&quot; alt=&quot;The Wrestler (2008) by Darren Aronofsky&quot; src=&quot;/images/2015/10/the-wrestler.jpg&quot; longdesc=&quot;#a9fc5865&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption id=&quot;a9fc5865&quot;&gt;The Wrestler (2008) by Darren Aronofsky&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;We are trying to &lt;em&gt;avoid explicitness&lt;/em&gt; in these sensitive subjects. Indeed, how can we tell Jeff that his salary is lower than Monica’s because his performance is worse? This will definitely lead to depression and negativity within the team, right?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What I’m trying to say is that &lt;em&gt;we don’t set rules&lt;/em&gt;. We think that strict and explicit rules related to performance offend creative people. Well, all people.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We avoid explicitness in performance appraisals.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And this is totally wrong!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is a &lt;em&gt;mistake&lt;/em&gt;, and it causes big problems!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Competition is inevitable in a group, especially if the group consists of creative people&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;When a group doesn’t have explicitly defined principles of survival and growth, it starts to create them &lt;em&gt;naturally&lt;/em&gt;. When people don’t know what exactly needs to be done in order to get a 15 percent raise, they find a way to get this information anyway. And guess what this information will end up being? Right—you have &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/01/26/happy-boss-false-objective.html&quot;&gt;to make your boss happy&lt;/a&gt;; that’s how your chances for a raise improve.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Instead of working toward the goals set by the organization, we are fighting with each other for the attention of our boss. Instead of focusing on the results and their quality, we are reading the mood of our &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/09/22/micromanagement.html&quot;&gt;manager&lt;/a&gt;. Our fear becomes a guide for us.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Competition is &lt;em&gt;inevitable&lt;/em&gt; in a group, especially if the group consists of creative people.

I assume you are sitting in the office right now, reading this blog post. Maybe you don’t like your office job, or maybe you enjoy it and feel excited to be close to your office friends. It doesn’t matter. What matters is that there is always an alternative to office slavery. I’m not talking about starting your own business. There are people in this world who work for someone without doing what is described below. They do exist, as well as companies that don’t turn their employees into slaves. I really hope you will eventually find one. In the meantime, this manual is for you :)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;!--more--&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;jb_picture&quot;&gt;&lt;img itemprop=&quot;image&quot; alt=&quot;The Office (2001–2003)&quot; src=&quot;/images/2015/10/the-office.jpg&quot; longdesc=&quot;#1003bba1&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption id=&quot;1003bba1&quot;&gt;The Office (2001–2003)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Help Others&lt;/strong&gt;. Find the stupidest newbies and help them. Regardless of what exactly you help them with, they should rely on you. Show them where the restroom is, recommend a good restaurant nearby, assist in an IDE installation, explain how the project works, and make standard jokes about the worst class in it. They must become your best friends—and not only them. Be helpful to everybody. No matter what is happening, everyone must know that you’re ready to help. Ideally, they all must depend on your kindness and readiness to save them from the &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/02/16/it-is-not-a-school.html&quot;&gt;chaos&lt;/a&gt; around.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Important people don't write code; they attend meetings&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be the Last to Leave the Office&lt;/strong&gt;. Nothing annoys a manager more than an employee who leaves the office at 5 p.m. sharp. It’s a sign of disrespect. Don’t you like it here? Is there anything in this life more important to you than this job? There shouldn’t be. Demonstrate that by staying late. Here is a simple trick: just come later. The boss won’t blame you for that. But always stay there after everybody else is gone. Ideally, you should leave right after the boss. &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/07/21/hourly-pay-modern-slavery.html&quot;&gt;Overtime&lt;/a&gt; is a clear sign of your loyalty to our mutual results.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t Nag&lt;/strong&gt;. No matter what is happening, you should never criticize your direct manager. The boss is &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/01/26/happy-boss-false-objective.html&quot;&gt;always right&lt;/a&gt;. Everything else may be wrong—the situation, colleagues, suppliers, computers, the CEO, investors, the market, or the weather, but not the boss you directly report to. The word of this person is the law. The boss is the god. Ideally, you should be the prophet. No matter what the boss says, you deliver it to others. And you must look like you sincerely believe that it’s right.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Loyalty is what makes you a good slave; don't forget it!&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attend All Meetings&lt;/strong&gt;. No matter what they are about, you must be there. And don’t just be present; actively participate. It’s not so difficult, and very soon you will start to understand what they are talking about and will be able to say something, even if you had no idea about the subject beforehand. Eventually, everybody will start thinking they must ask your permission in order to make some decision, because you were at that meeting. Important people don’t write code; they attend &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/07/13/meetings-are-legalized-robbery.html&quot;&gt;meetings&lt;/a&gt;. Remember that.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Turn Down Recruiters, Publicly&lt;/strong&gt;. Loyalty! That’s what matters to a real team. When a recruiter calls you, raise your voice and explain that you’re happy in this company and don’t want to move on, ever. The more people who hear you, the better. Also, you can sometimes tell stories about offers you’re getting and how you turn them down. Your boss should be the main audience for these stories. Why do you turn them down? Not because they are bad, but because your life belongs to this company. Loyalty is what makes you a &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/07/21/hourly-pay-modern-slavery.html&quot;&gt;good slave&lt;/a&gt;; don’t forget it!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t Take Sides&lt;/strong&gt;. It’s just too risky. In any argument, you can always find pros and cons for both sides, right? So why support one of them? You may be wrong and lose respect in front of everybody. Why take that chance? Instead, always say that there are drawbacks to both options. That’s what a wise man would say, anyway. There is no absolute truth in this world. That’s why you should always stay in the middle, where you will never be wrong. Well, until your boss takes one of the sides. That’s the right moment to agree and follow.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Never Ask for a Raise&lt;/strong&gt;. It should be absolutely clear to everybody that you don’t work for money. You work for &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/03/02/team-morale-myths-and-reality.html&quot;&gt;the big idea&lt;/a&gt;. Period.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attend All Social Events&lt;/strong&gt;. Birthdays, corporate parties, Halloween, Friday beers—you must be there, always. Don’t worry about wasting your life; you will like them eventually. It is very important to demonstrate that you truly live in the office. You are not just writing code, taking money, and going home to your family. Absolutely not! The office is your real family, and you truly enjoy eating pizza with your boss and listening to his childhood stories. That’s how you demonstrate your loyalty, which is the best quality of a &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/07/21/hourly-pay-modern-slavery.html&quot;&gt;good slave&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Point Fingers Privately&lt;/strong&gt;. Don’t say anything bad about anyone in public. No matter who is doing what, we’re always a team; we’re together. Together! This should be your main keyword when talking about results, problems, and risks. Never blame anyone—publicly. However, when you’re talking in the kitchen with a few of your most trusted colleagues, let yourself go. Tell them who you think is the weakest part of the team and what you would do with him or her if you were the boss. Don’t restrict yourself, but always make sure there are only a few people who can hear you.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Added 8-Oct-2015:&lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Never Ask for Vacation&lt;/strong&gt;. When the time is right, your boss will inform you that you can go on vacation. He is the one who knows when it is suitable for the company to have you away for a few days. It can’t be in the middle of a project obviously, nor in the beginning, and definitely not near the end of it. It is usually matched with popular vacation periods in a year (e.g. Christmas, New Year). That might be a bit more expensive for you, but reward of not betraying the company is priceless. If you do make a mistake of asking for a vacation, try to make it short. The worst thing you can do while trying to extend vacation days is to mention that you could “still work while out of the office”—that will immediately get you in a position where you don’t need the office, hence the office doesn’t need you.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Added 30-Jun-2016:&lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;CC Your Boss&lt;/strong&gt;. Add your boss in a CC for as many emails as possible. The more &lt;a href=&quot;/2017/04/18/no-help-via-email.html&quot;&gt;emails&lt;/a&gt; that come from you, the more valuable you are. Your boss must see that you’re actively involved in many communications and that it’s simply impossible to replace you. Besides that, CC-ing the boss is a sign of respect. She or he will never forget that.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sigh, Don’t Laugh&lt;/strong&gt;. You must look very concerned about situations regarding the project, the team, the management, the office space, and everyone’s future. If you’re not concerned and laugh about it, how can you be trusted? That’s a clear sign that you’re not taking your job seriously, and who knows what you will do tomorrow. Don’t be like that. Instead, always look a bit sad. God forbid you look happy in front of the boss.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Care About Everything&lt;/strong&gt;. No matter what the discussion is about, you care about the subject. There is nothing involving the team that doesn’t bother you. You must show that you feel responsible for every problem and each task. Also, when there is a discussion in the office and someone is doing his own thing, paying no attention to the subject, you should ask, “Doesn’t this concern you at all?” Make him feel guilty for not being careful enough—that will give you a lot of points for “being on top of all things.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Look Tired&lt;/strong&gt;. Always look a bit tired, as if you were working all night and barely got a few hours of sleep. Also, try to make it obvious that you were fixing some old bug in the system that nobody except you really cares about. You must not look too energetic—this disrespects your boss. He didn’t give you enough work to wear you out completely? That means he is a bad manager. Instead, you should even joke that “our boss knows how to keep us busy.” That flattery will definitely please even a smart person.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Added 13-Aug-2017:&lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Have No Hobbies&lt;/strong&gt;. It’s very annoying to see you enjoying something else aside from the job in the office. Your happiness and your heart must be here, at the work desk. Not somewhere else, at a snow slope or a tennis court. Sport, dancing, singing, gaming, painting, even open sourcing—are the activities you must hide. You are betraying your boss and your company if anything aside from the project is making you happy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;hr /&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you follow all these rules, you won’t be fired, ever. Well, until the company is bankrupt, that is. If it’s a startup, it will go bankrupt for sure, thanks to you and people like you. If it’s a big enterprise, it probably won’t, unfortunately. You will be safe, and your &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/03/08/pimp-up-your-resume.html&quot;&gt;resume&lt;/a&gt; will have an &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/10/29/how-much-do-you-cost.html&quot;&gt;impressive&lt;/a&gt; “12 years at Oracle” statement. Well, that’s an achievement, isn’t it?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I don’t think so.&lt;/p&gt; " /> <meta name="keywords" content="next, path, output, content, previous, url, relative_path, id, collection, excerpt, draft, categories, layout, title, date, place, tags, description, keywords, related, social, image, jb_picture, slug, ext" /> <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1"/> <meta name="google-site-verification" content="JEj_gQr2CPe2QKGw8XdMz0R7VboQIUbX3FlM-lwTq-8" /> <meta name="author" content="Yegor Bugayenko"> <meta name="article:published_time" content="2015-10-06 00:00:00 +0000"> <meta name="og:site_name" content="Yegor Bugayenko"/> <meta name="og:type" content="article" /> <meta name="og:locale" content="en_US" /> <meta name="twitter:account_id" content="4503599630178231" /> <meta name="twitter:creator" content="@yegor256"/> <meta name="twitter:site" content="@yegor256"/> <meta name="twitter:title" property="og:title" content="How to Be a Good Office Slave"/> <meta name="twitter:description" property="og:description" content="&lt;p&gt;This is a short manual for you, my friend.

I assume you are sitting in the office right now, reading this blog post. Maybe you don’t like your office job, or maybe you enjoy it and feel excited to be close to your office friends. It doesn’t matter. What matters is that there is always an alternative to office slavery. I’m not talking about starting your own business. There are people in this world who work for someone without doing what is described below. They do exist, as well as companies that don’t turn their employees into slaves. I really hope you will eventually find one. In the meantime, this manual is for you :)</p><figure class="jb_picture"><img itemprop="image" alt="The Office (2001–2003)" src="/images/2015/10/the-office.jpg" longdesc="#1003bba1" /><figcaption id="1003bba1">The Office (2001–2003)</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Help Others</strong>. Find the stupidest newbies and help them. Regardless of what exactly you help them with, they should rely on you. Show them where the restroom is, recommend a good restaurant nearby, assist in an IDE installation, explain how the project works, and make standard jokes about the worst class in it. They must become your best friends—and not only them. Be helpful to everybody. No matter what is happening, everyone must know that you’re ready to help. Ideally, they all must depend on your kindness and readiness to save them from the <a href="/2015/02/16/it-is-not-a-school.html">chaos</a> around.</p><aside class="quote">Important people don't write code; they attend meetings</aside><p><strong>Be the Last to Leave the Office</strong>. Nothing annoys a manager more than an employee who leaves the office at 5 p.m. sharp. It’s a sign of disrespect. Don’t you like it here? Is there anything in this life more important to you than this job? There shouldn’t be. Demonstrate that by staying late. Here is a simple trick: just come later. The boss won’t blame you for that. But always stay there after everybody else is gone. Ideally, you should leave right after the boss. <a href="/2015/07/21/hourly-pay-modern-slavery.html">Overtime</a> is a clear sign of your loyalty to our mutual results.</p><p><strong>Don’t Nag</strong>. No matter what is happening, you should never criticize your direct manager. The boss is <a href="/2015/01/26/happy-boss-false-objective.html">always right</a>. Everything else may be wrong—the situation, colleagues, suppliers, computers, the CEO, investors, the market, or the weather, but not the boss you directly report to. The word of this person is the law. The boss is the god. Ideally, you should be the prophet. No matter what the boss says, you deliver it to others. And you must look like you sincerely believe that it’s right.</p><aside class="quote">Loyalty is what makes you a good slave; don't forget it!</aside><p><strong>Attend All Meetings</strong>. No matter what they are about, you must be there. And don’t just be present; actively participate. It’s not so difficult, and very soon you will start to understand what they are talking about and will be able to say something, even if you had no idea about the subject beforehand. Eventually, everybody will start thinking they must ask your permission in order to make some decision, because you were at that meeting. Important people don’t write code; they attend <a href="/2015/07/13/meetings-are-legalized-robbery.html">meetings</a>. Remember that.</p><p><strong>Turn Down Recruiters, Publicly</strong>. Loyalty! That’s what matters to a real team. When a recruiter calls you, raise your voice and explain that you’re happy in this company and don’t want to move on, ever. The more people who hear you, the better. Also, you can sometimes tell stories about offers you’re getting and how you turn them down. Your boss should be the main audience for these stories. Why do you turn them down? Not because they are bad, but because your life belongs to this company. Loyalty is what makes you a <a href="/2015/07/21/hourly-pay-modern-slavery.html">good slave</a>; don’t forget it!</p><p><strong>Don’t Take Sides</strong>. It’s just too risky. In any argument, you can always find pros and cons for both sides, right? So why support one of them? You may be wrong and lose respect in front of everybody. Why take that chance? Instead, always say that there are drawbacks to both options. That’s what a wise man would say, anyway. There is no absolute truth in this world. That’s why you should always stay in the middle, where you will never be wrong. Well, until your boss takes one of the sides. That’s the right moment to agree and follow.</p><p><strong>Never Ask for a Raise</strong>. It should be absolutely clear to everybody that you don’t work for money. You work for <a href="/2015/03/02/team-morale-myths-and-reality.html">the big idea</a>. Period.</p><p><strong>Attend All Social Events</strong>. Birthdays, corporate parties, Halloween, Friday beers—you must be there, always. Don’t worry about wasting your life; you will like them eventually. It is very important to demonstrate that you truly live in the office. You are not just writing code, taking money, and going home to your family. Absolutely not! The office is your real family, and you truly enjoy eating pizza with your boss and listening to his childhood stories. That’s how you demonstrate your loyalty, which is the best quality of a <a href="/2015/07/21/hourly-pay-modern-slavery.html">good slave</a>.</p><p><strong>Point Fingers Privately</strong>. Don’t say anything bad about anyone in public. No matter who is doing what, we’re always a team; we’re together. Together! This should be your main keyword when talking about results, problems, and risks. Never blame anyone—publicly. However, when you’re talking in the kitchen with a few of your most trusted colleagues, let yourself go. Tell them who you think is the weakest part of the team and what you would do with him or her if you were the boss. Don’t restrict yourself, but always make sure there are only a few people who can hear you.</p><p>Added 8-Oct-2015:<br /> <strong>Never Ask for Vacation</strong>. When the time is right, your boss will inform you that you can go on vacation. He is the one who knows when it is suitable for the company to have you away for a few days. It can’t be in the middle of a project obviously, nor in the beginning, and definitely not near the end of it. It is usually matched with popular vacation periods in a year (e.g. Christmas, New Year). That might be a bit more expensive for you, but reward of not betraying the company is priceless. If you do make a mistake of asking for a vacation, try to make it short. The worst thing you can do while trying to extend vacation days is to mention that you could “still work while out of the office”—that will immediately get you in a position where you don’t need the office, hence the office doesn’t need you.</p><p>Added 30-Jun-2016:<br /> <strong>CC Your Boss</strong>. Add your boss in a CC for as many emails as possible. The more <a href="/2017/04/18/no-help-via-email.html">emails</a> that come from you, the more valuable you are. Your boss must see that you’re actively involved in many communications and that it’s simply impossible to replace you. Besides that, CC-ing the boss is a sign of respect. She or he will never forget that.</p><p><strong>Sigh, Don’t Laugh</strong>. You must look very concerned about situations regarding the project, the team, the management, the office space, and everyone’s future. If you’re not concerned and laugh about it, how can you be trusted? That’s a clear sign that you’re not taking your job seriously, and who knows what you will do tomorrow. Don’t be like that. Instead, always look a bit sad. God forbid you look happy in front of the boss.</p><p><strong>Care About Everything</strong>. No matter what the discussion is about, you care about the subject. There is nothing involving the team that doesn’t bother you. You must show that you feel responsible for every problem and each task. Also, when there is a discussion in the office and someone is doing his own thing, paying no attention to the subject, you should ask, “Doesn’t this concern you at all?” Make him feel guilty for not being careful enough—that will give you a lot of points for “being on top of all things.”</p><p><strong>Look Tired</strong>. Always look a bit tired, as if you were working all night and barely got a few hours of sleep. Also, try to make it obvious that you were fixing some old bug in the system that nobody except you really cares about. You must not look too energetic—this disrespects your boss. He didn’t give you enough work to wear you out completely? That means he is a bad manager. Instead, you should even joke that “our boss knows how to keep us busy.” That flattery will definitely please even a smart person.</p><p>Added 13-Aug-2017:<br /> <strong>Have No Hobbies</strong>. It’s very annoying to see you enjoying something else aside from the job in the office. Your happiness and your heart must be here, at the work desk. Not somewhere else, at a snow slope or a tennis court. Sport, dancing, singing, gaming, painting, even open sourcing—are the activities you must hide. You are betraying your boss and your company if anything aside from the project is making you happy.</p><hr /><p>If you follow all these rules, you won’t be fired, ever. Well, until the company is bankrupt, that is. If it’s a startup, it will go bankrupt for sure, thanks to you and people like you. If it’s a big enterprise, it probably won’t, unfortunately. You will be safe, and your <a href="/2016/03/08/pimp-up-your-resume.html">resume</a> will have an <a href="/2014/10/29/how-much-do-you-cost.html">impressive</a> “12 years at Oracle” statement. Well, that’s an achievement, isn’t it?</p><p>I don’t think so.</p></p><nav class="buttons notranslate desktop-only"> <a href="http://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://www.yegor256.com/2015/10/06/how-to-be-good-office-slave.html" title="Share on Facebook" class="button" rel="nofollow"> <span class="count count-facebook">0</span> <i class="icon icon-facebook notranslate" aria-hidden="true"></i> </a> <a href="https://twitter.com/share?url=https://www.yegor256.com/2015/10/06/how-to-be-good-office-slave.html&amp;text=How+to+Be+a+Good+Office+Slave" title="Share on Twitter" class="button" rel="nofollow"> <span class="count count-twitter">0</span> <i class="icon icon-twitter notranslate" aria-hidden="true"></i> </a> <a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=https://www.yegor256.com/2015/10/06/how-to-be-good-office-slave.html" title="Share on Google+" class="button" rel="nofollow"> <span class="count count-googleplus">0</span> <i class="icon icon-googleplus notranslate" aria-hidden="true"></i> </a> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/cws/share?url=https://www.yegor256.com/2015/10/06/how-to-be-good-office-slave.html" title="Share on LinkedIn" class="button" rel="nofollow"> <span class="count count-linkedin">0</span> <i class="icon icon-linkedin notranslate" aria-hidden="true"></i> </a> <a href="http://reddit.com/submit?url=https://www.yegor256.com/2015/10/06/how-to-be-good-office-slave.html%3F2015-40&amp;title=How+to+Be+a+Good+Office+Slave" title="Share on Reddit" class="button" rel="nofollow"> <span class="count count-reddit">0</span> <i class="icon icon-reddit notranslate" aria-hidden="true"></i> </a> <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/submitlink?u=https://www.yegor256.com/2015/10/06/how-to-be-good-office-slave.html%3F2015-40&amp;t=How+to+Be+a+Good+Office+Slave" title="Share on Hacker News" class="button" rel="nofollow"> <span class="count count-hackernews">0</span> <i class="icon icon-hackernews notranslate" aria-hidden="true"></i> </a> </nav> </header> <article class="main" itemprop="articleBody"><div ><p>This is a short manual for you, my friend.

You must look very concerned about situations regarding the project, the team, the management, the office space, and everyone’s future. If you’re not concerned and laugh about it, how can you be trusted? That’s a clear sign that you’re not taking your job seriously, and who knows what you will do tomorrow. Don’t be like that. Instead, always look a bit sad. God forbid you look happy in front of the boss.</p><p><strong>Care About Everything</strong>. No matter what the discussion is about, you care about the subject. There is nothing involving the team that doesn’t bother you. You must show that you feel responsible for every problem and each task. Also, when there is a discussion in the office and someone is doing his own thing, paying no attention to the subject, you should ask, “Doesn’t this concern you at all?” Make him feel guilty for not being careful enough—that will give you a lot of points for “being on top of all things.”</p><p><strong>Look Tired</strong>. Always look a bit tired, as if you were working all night and barely got a few hours of sleep. Also, try to make it obvious that you were fixing some old bug in the system that nobody except you really cares about. You must not look too energetic—this disrespects your boss. He didn’t give you enough work to wear you out completely? That means he is a bad manager. Instead, you should even joke that “our boss knows how to keep us busy.” That flattery will definitely please even a smart person.</p><p>Added 13-Aug-2017:<br /> <strong>Have No Hobbies</strong>. It’s very annoying to see you enjoying something else aside from the job in the office. Your happiness and your heart must be here, at the work desk. Not somewhere else, at a snow slope or a tennis court. Sport, dancing, singing, gaming, painting, even open sourcing—are the activities you must hide. You are betraying your boss and your company if anything aside from the project is making you happy.</p><hr /><p>If you follow all these rules, you won’t be fired, ever. Well, until the company is bankrupt, that is. If it’s a startup, it will go bankrupt for sure, thanks to you and people like you. If it’s a big enterprise, it probably won’t, unfortunately. You will be safe, and your <a href="/2016/03/08/pimp-up-your-resume.html">resume</a> will have an <a href="/2014/10/29/how-much-do-you-cost.html">impressive</a> “12 years at Oracle” statement.

I second that. Producers, &lt;a href=&quot;/2017/02/21/say-no-to-google-recruiters.html&quot;&gt;recruiters&lt;/a&gt;, managers, real estate agents, sales agents, lawyers, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://english.stackexchange.com/questions/103448/is-outstaffing-a-real-word&quot;&gt;outstaffers&lt;/a&gt;—what do they all have in common?

Their very existence is our mutual misfortune. We are too weak to get rid of them now, but sooner or later every supply chain will be &lt;strong&gt;mayonnaise-free&lt;/strong&gt;. Look at Uber—taxi companies are dead already, and we now have only drivers and passengers with a computer system in between. The same will happen everywhere else.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;!--more--&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;jb_picture&quot;&gt;&lt;img itemprop=&quot;image&quot; alt=&quot;What Just Happened (2008) by Barry Levinson&quot; src=&quot;/images/2015/09/what-just-happened.jpg&quot; longdesc=&quot;#c6f3cd63&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption id=&quot;c6f3cd63&quot;&gt;What Just Happened (2008) by Barry Levinson&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Seriously, look at &lt;a href=&quot;/2017/02/21/say-no-to-google-recruiters.html&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IT recruiters&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, for example. To find a programmer, one has to pay about $30K (in Silicon Valley, if a programmer’s salary is, say, $120K a year) to a recruiter. $30,000! What will this money be spent on? Or let me put it this way: How much software will I get for this money? Let me put it even better: Why don’t I give this money to the programmer directly as a bonus for switching companies? Why do &lt;strong&gt;we&lt;/strong&gt; need this &lt;a href=&quot;/2017/02/21/say-no-to-google-recruiters.html&quot;&gt;recruiter&lt;/a&gt; between us—me and the programmer I’m going to hire? Can’t we use this $30,000 more effectively?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Because software systems are not powerful enough yet? Because I can’t find a programmer with a few clicks and I have to delegate this search function to someone for $30K?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Well, yes and no.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;IT recruiters stay between us, stealing our money and protecting that position for themselves&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;On one hand, there are plenty of job sites and rather powerful technologies for finding the right person. There is &lt;a href=&quot;https://careers.stackoverflow.com/&quot;&gt;StackOverflow Careers&lt;/a&gt;, which not only allows me to find a programmer but also see what he or she talks about and the quality of his or her questions and answers. There is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.github.com&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; that demonstrates the code written by a programmer, helping me easily understand its quality. There are professional certifications that show how strong a candidate’s skills are. And there are plenty of other avenues.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On the other hand, these tools are not actively used by the majority of programmers and software companies—mostly because &lt;a href=&quot;/2017/02/21/say-no-to-google-recruiters.html&quot;&gt;IT recruiters&lt;/a&gt; stay between us, &lt;strong&gt;stealing&lt;/strong&gt; our money and protecting that position for themselves. Just like taxi companies remain between passengers and drivers, or real estate agents get in between house owners and house buyers, or &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/10/27/outsourcing-doesnt-work.html&quot;&gt;outstaffing companies&lt;/a&gt; squeeze in the middle of project sponsors and engineers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Imagine if there was no Google and you had to hire a “researcher” every time you needed to find some information. That’s how it worked 50 years ago. Not anymore. Google solved the problem of information discovery. It is fast, it is accurate, and it is free. The researchers are out of business. Are we sorry about it? Well, maybe, but that’s the way it should be. The same will happen with IT recruiters and all those “agents.” They will eventually be out of business and will start doing something that actually adds &lt;strong&gt;some value&lt;/strong&gt; for all of us.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At the moment, they are simply taking away our money, &lt;strong&gt;exploiting&lt;/strong&gt; the fact that we’re lazy, or stupid, or shy, or you name it. For example, it was not obvious in the beginning how to use Google. I know a few people who still don’t know how to do it. I’m sure you know a few, too. They would rather call a friend when they need information than pull up Google.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Say I’m a good friend and Jeff calls me to ask what the weather will be like tomorrow in California. I’ll advise him to Google it, now and every time in the future. I will teach him how to do it. But if I was a lousy friend and wanted Jeff to depend on me forever, I would just browse over to Google, check the weather, and tell Jeff it’ll be cloudy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That’s exactly what recruiters are doing. Their entire business is based on the fact that we’re &lt;strong&gt;not smart&lt;/strong&gt; enough to use existing software systems, publicly available and in most cases very cheap or simply free. Or we’re &lt;strong&gt;too shy&lt;/strong&gt; to apply for a new job ourselves. Or we just &lt;strong&gt;don’t know&lt;/strong&gt; how to write a &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/03/08/pimp-up-your-resume.html&quot;&gt;good resume&lt;/a&gt; and emphasize our skills properly. They are exploiting our weaknesses to make money.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A friend of mine was looking for a house in San Francisco a few months ago. He actually found the house on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.zillow.com&quot;&gt;Zillow&lt;/a&gt; but paid $70,000 to two real estate agents to help him close the deal (the price of the house was close to $1.4 million, with 2.5 percent to each agent). What did these “hard-working” people do to earn his $70,000? They prepared the necessary paperwork and, of course, talked to him for a few weeks.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Can’t we get rid of these two good-for-nothings and delegate their operations to a computer system? Well, we have Zillow, but how much of my friend’s $70,000 found its way to Zillow? Almost nothing (I assume one of the agents paid a few pennies to publish an ad there). Is that fair? Let’s instead give $5,000 out of every real estate transaction to Zillow and let it handle everything, automatically. Without any “agents” involved. Can we? I’m sure we can, and that’s the future.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What will the army of real estate agents do? Well, maybe something useful, like &lt;strong&gt;cleaning streets&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;$25 out of my $40 will be spent not writing code but rather on something else&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;The very existence of this mayonnaise in our modern business environment is a very negative thing. Money is simply not working the way it should. Also, since this mayonnaise is rather expensive, its existence creates a very de-motivating effect on those who are actually delivering value while making a much smaller income. It obviously demonstrates that the entire system is defective and simply not fair.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The same is true about &lt;strong&gt;outstaffing&lt;/strong&gt; companies, which we contract with to gain access to programmers sitting somewhere overseas or much closer. They find developers, hire them full-time, and resell their skills with a 150 percent or greater margin on a part-time or short-term basis. I’ve been getting a few offers from such companies every day.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They want me to pay, say, $40 for each hour while a developer sitting in their &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/10/06/how-to-be-good-office-slave.html&quot;&gt;office&lt;/a&gt; gets like $2,500 per month. This means $25 out of my $40 will be spent &lt;strong&gt;not writing code&lt;/strong&gt; but rather on something else. Also, a programmer will be motivated for the $2,500, not for $7,000. So I will be paying $7K per month and getting software worth $2,500 a month.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I will be paying for a Mercedes-Benz S-Class but getting a Ford Focus. I’m not greedy; I just want my every dollar to be converted into some value. In this scenario, $4,500 will be simply wasted.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The same is true about every single middleman in the market. They make business processes less effective, take away significant amounts of money, and slow down optimizations and innovations. A truly modern and innovative way of doing business is by &lt;strong&gt;directly connecting money and people&lt;/strong&gt; who add value. There should be no one in between except computer systems.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sometimes I hear the comment that people love to work with people, not computers. That’s why we need all that mayonnaise—to make our life &lt;strong&gt;happier&lt;/strong&gt;? It’s true that people love to deal with people—people we really need, people who speak the same language, and people who deliver &lt;strong&gt;real value&lt;/strong&gt;. Not with producers, recruiters, real estate agents, sales agents, outstaffers, lawyers, travel agents, investment brokers, executive officers, or taxi dispatchers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The point of Bruce Willis’s character is that when the sandwich is bad you don’t fix it with a mayonnaise. It won’t help, but only make things worse.&lt;/p&gt; " /> <meta name="keywords" content="next, path, output, content, previous, url, relative_path, id, collection, excerpt, draft, categories, layout, title, date, place, tags, description, keywords, image, jb_picture, slug, ext" /> <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1"/> <meta name="google-site-verification" content="JEj_gQr2CPe2QKGw8XdMz0R7VboQIUbX3FlM-lwTq-8" /> <meta name="author" content="Yegor Bugayenko"> <meta name="article:published_time" content="2015-09-29 00:00:00 +0000"> <meta name="og:site_name" content="Yegor Bugayenko"/> <meta name="og:type" content="article" /> <meta name="og:locale" content="en_US" /> <meta name="twitter:account_id" content="4503599630178231" /> <meta name="twitter:creator" content="@yegor256"/> <meta name="twitter:site" content="@yegor256"/> <meta name="twitter:title" property="og:title" content="You're Just the Mayonnaise in a Bad Sandwich"/> <meta name="twitter:description" property="og:description" content="&lt;p&gt;That’s what a character played by actor Bruce Willis said to Robert DeNiro’s movie producer character in Barry Levinson’s brilliant film &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0486674/&quot;&gt;What Just Happened&lt;/a&gt;.

That’s why we need all that mayonnaise—to make our life &lt;strong&gt;happier&lt;/strong&gt;? It’s true that people love to deal with people—people we really need, people who speak the same language, and people who deliver &lt;strong&gt;real value&lt;/strong&gt;. Not with producers, recruiters, real estate agents, sales agents, outstaffers, lawyers, travel agents, investment brokers, executive officers, or taxi dispatchers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The point of Bruce Willis’s character is that when the sandwich is bad you don’t fix it with a mayonnaise. It won’t help, but only make things worse.&lt;/p&gt; "/> <meta name="twitter:url" property="og:url" content="https://www.yegor256.com/2015/09/29/mayonnaise.html"/> <meta name="telegram:channel"

A truly modern and innovative way of doing business is by <strong>directly connecting money and people</strong> who add value. There should be no one in between except computer systems.</p><p>Sometimes I hear the comment that people love to work with people, not computers. That’s why we need all that mayonnaise—to make our life <strong>happier</strong>? It’s true that people love to deal with people—people we really need, people who speak the same language, and people who deliver <strong>real value</strong>. Not with producers, recruiters, real estate agents, sales agents, outstaffers, lawyers, travel agents, investment brokers, executive officers, or taxi dispatchers.</p><p>The point of Bruce Willis’s character is that when the sandwich is bad you don’t fix it with a mayonnaise.

If firing is a painful and unpleasant process for you, there is a problem with your management model. Firing must be an &lt;em&gt;easy&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;open&lt;/em&gt; procedure, &lt;em&gt;visible&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;understood&lt;/em&gt; by the entire team.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;!--more--&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;jb_picture&quot;&gt;&lt;img itemprop=&quot;image&quot; alt=&quot;Up in the Air (2009) by Jason Reitman&quot; src=&quot;/images/2015/09/up-in-the-air.jpg&quot; longdesc=&quot;#437191c8&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption id=&quot;437191c8&quot;&gt;Up in the Air (2009) by Jason Reitman&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;I mentioned this problem before in &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/03/02/team-morale-myths-and-reality.html&quot;&gt;my post&lt;/a&gt; about team morale. I said that firing someone should not be done behind &lt;em&gt;closed doors&lt;/em&gt;. Instead, the assessment of individual performance should occur openly and be visible to the entire team. If you need to close the door in order to talk “privately” to express your concerns and eventually to fire someone, you are a &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/09/22/micromanagement.html&quot;&gt;bad manager&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I also explained &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/01/26/happy-boss-false-objective.html&quot;&gt;some time ago&lt;/a&gt; that a perfectly managed team is working for the project, not for you, the boss. The team must share the same goal and work towards it. The boss (or CEO, CTO, &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/05/24/who-is-project-manager.html&quot;&gt;project manager&lt;/a&gt;, Scrum master, team lead, etc.) is there in order to enforce the &lt;em&gt;rules&lt;/em&gt; accepted by the team.

However, there’s more. The entire eXtremely Distributed Software Development (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.xdsd.org&quot;&gt;XDSD&lt;/a&gt;) methodology is based on a primary fundamental principle that states, “Everyone gets paid for verified deliverables.” They’re not paid for their time per hour, per week, or per month, but rather for verified deliverables. What is the difference and what does all this have to do with slavery? Let’s see.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;badge&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/2crHiNG&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.yegor256.com/images/2015/07/how-to-manage-your-slaves.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width:96px;max-width:100%;&quot; alt=&quot;badge&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;My point here is that any payment schedule based on time instead of results is turning us into slaves.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Here is an example. Say I’m a software developer and I need some money to pay my bills, buy a car, rent a house, and enjoy my life. I have some skills for that. I can write Java software. I find a company that needs my skills. It hires me, and we sign a contract. The contract says I have to be in the &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/10/06/how-to-be-good-office-slave.html&quot;&gt;office&lt;/a&gt; from 9 until 5 and I have to do what my boss tells me to do. In exchange, I will get paychecks every few weeks, which will cover my expenses.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;youtube&quot;&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODxm7w2DE-g&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;box&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ODxm7w2DE-g/mqdefault.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;YouTube video #ODxm7w2DE-g&quot; /&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;play&quot;&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;icon icon-play&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;div&gt;#NoSalaries; 12 April 2018.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;Doesn’t it look similar to what I just said above about ancient slaves? The master (a.k.a. CEO) tells me what to do and punishes me at will; in exchange, he gives me food and safety.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The problem here is not about &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/01/05/how-to-punish-employees.html&quot;&gt;punishment&lt;/a&gt;. This model of work makes me &lt;em&gt;think like a slave&lt;/em&gt;. I think this is a fair exchange—I give away my freedom (my time), and I get back food and safety. I’m a slave not because the master is punishing me and I’m sitting all day long in fetters. Absolutely not. A slave is not the one who was captured and imprisoned. A slave is one who thinks slavery is a fair way of management.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Letting someone tell me what to do with my time in order to get food in return is exactly what slavery is about.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What is freedom, then? How should a free man make money?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;A free man sells results, not time&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;A free man sells the &lt;em&gt;results of his work&lt;/em&gt;. A free man cleans someone’s house and bills him when the work is done. A free man drives passengers from the airport to their home and bills them when they get there. A free man creates a software module and bills the client when it’s ready. A free man translates a document and bills per page. A free man cooks a cake and bills for it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A free man sells results, not time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Also, a free man takes care of the food and security on his or her own.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Is it more risky? Yes. Is it more stressful? Yes. But that’s what freedom is about.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is my favorite quote from the book: “a good slave is loyal, hard-working and vigilant.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Think about it.&lt;/p&gt; " /> <meta name="keywords" content="next, path, output, content, previous, url, relative_path, id, collection, excerpt, draft, categories, layout, title, date, tags, place, description, keywords, translated, image, jb_picture, slug, ext" /> <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1"/> <meta name="google-site-verification" content="JEj_gQr2CPe2QKGw8XdMz0R7VboQIUbX3FlM-lwTq-8" /> <meta name="author" content="Yegor Bugayenko"> <meta name="article:published_time" content="2015-07-21 00:00:00 +0000"> <meta name="og:site_name" content="Yegor Bugayenko"/> <meta name="og:type" content="article" /> <meta name="og:locale" content="en_US" /> <meta name="twitter:account_id" content="4503599630178231" /> <meta name="twitter:creator" content="@yegor256"/> <meta name="twitter:site" content="@yegor256"/> <meta name="twitter:title" property="og:title" content="Hourly Pay Is Modern Slavery"/> <meta name="twitter:description" property="og:description" content="&lt;p&gt;What is the difference between a slave and a free man?

The entire eXtremely Distributed Software Development (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.xdsd.org&quot;&gt;XDSD&lt;/a&gt;) methodology is based on a primary fundamental principle that states, “Everyone gets paid for verified deliverables.” They’re not paid for their time per hour, per week, or per month, but rather for verified deliverables. What is the difference and what does all this have to do with slavery? Let’s see.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;badge&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/2crHiNG&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.yegor256.com/images/2015/07/how-to-manage-your-slaves.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width:96px;max-width:100%;&quot; alt=&quot;badge&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;My point here is that any payment schedule based on time instead of results is turning us into slaves.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Here is an example. Say I’m a software developer and I need some money to pay my bills, buy a car, rent a house, and enjoy my life. I have some skills for that. I can write Java software. I find a company that needs my skills. It hires me, and we sign a contract. The contract says I have to be in the &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/10/06/how-to-be-good-office-slave.html&quot;&gt;office&lt;/a&gt; from 9 until 5 and I have to do what my boss tells me to do. In exchange, I will get paychecks every few weeks, which will cover my expenses.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;youtube&quot;&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODxm7w2DE-g&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;box&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ODxm7w2DE-g/mqdefault.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;YouTube video #ODxm7w2DE-g&quot; /&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;play&quot;&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;icon icon-play&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;div&gt;#NoSalaries; 12 April 2018.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;Doesn’t it look similar to what I just said above about ancient slaves? The master (a.k.a. CEO) tells me what to do and punishes me at will; in exchange, he gives me food and safety.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The problem here is not about &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/01/05/how-to-punish-employees.html&quot;&gt;punishment&lt;/a&gt;. This model of work makes me &lt;em&gt;think like a slave&lt;/em&gt;. I think this is a fair exchange—I give away my freedom (my time), and I get back food and safety. I’m a slave not because the master is punishing me and I’m sitting all day long in fetters. Absolutely not. A slave is not the one who was captured and imprisoned. A slave is one who thinks slavery is a fair way of management.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Letting someone tell me what to do with my time in order to get food in return is exactly what slavery is about.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What is freedom, then? How should a free man make money?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;A free man sells results, not time&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;A free man sells the &lt;em&gt;results of his work&lt;/em&gt;. A free man cleans someone’s house and bills him when the work is done. A free man drives passengers from the airport to their home and bills them when they get there. A free man creates a software module and bills the client when it’s ready. A free man translates a document and bills per page. A free man cooks a cake and bills for it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A free man sells results, not time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Also, a free man takes care of the food and security on his or her own.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Is it more risky? Yes. Is it more stressful? Yes. But that’s what freedom is about.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is my favorite quote from the book: “a good slave is loyal, hard-working and vigilant.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Think about it.&lt;/p&gt; "/> <meta

free man? A slave has a master. That master, a cruel and ruthless villain, is telling the slave what to do and punishing him at will. However, at the same time, the master guarantees food and a roof over the slave’s head. A slave understands this exchange of freedom for food as a fair trade, while a free man values freedom more. That’s the difference. That’s how it was in the Roman empire centuries ago. But isn’t that how it is now too?

But more about that later. For now, let’s discuss a proposed alternative.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Say I’m an architect who needs to design the schema for a relational database in a new project, and I have a team of five programmers whom I want to help me with this design. That’s a very logical and appropriate desire, as a good architect always discusses all possible options with available team members before making a final decision. So I call a meeting? No!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;a-good-architect&quot;&gt;A Good Architect&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;I ask Jeff, one of our programmers, to create a draft of the DB schema, but I don’t actually talk to him about it. I value and respect his time—there’s no need to bother him with this organizational noise, so I just create a ticket and assign it to Jeff. When he has time, he creates a draft and returns a pull request. I review it and make some comments before he updates the branch, and finally &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/07/24/rultor-automated-merging.html&quot;&gt;I merge it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;youtube&quot;&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LB_YLWhGrco&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;box&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LB_YLWhGrco/mqdefault.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;YouTube video #LB_YLWhGrco&quot; /&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;play&quot;&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;icon icon-play&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;div&gt;Meetings-free Programming; 1 April 2016.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;Perfect; we have a draft.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At the end of the document, Jeff also listed assumptions, risks, and concerns. For example, this is what I got back from him (it’s Markdown, a very convenient format for simple technical documents; I highly recommend it):&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;## Tables user (id INT, name VARCHAR, email VARCHAR); payment (id INT, date DATETIME, amount INT); order (id INT, details VARCHAR, user_id INT FK(user)); ## Assumptions - All payments will be in whole dollars, no cents. - All users will have only one email. - There will be no search feature required. ## Risks - Order details may not fit into VARCHAR. - Foreign keys may not be supported in the DBMS. ## Concerns - Would NoSQL be more suitable? - What is the DB server we&amp;#39;ll use?&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;I don’t know how much time Jeff would have spent on this document, but I just created it in 10 minutes. Of course, it’s a very simple schema for a very simple project. But even if Jeff spent an hour on it, every minute of that hour is valuable to the project. What I mean is that every dollar I pay Jeff for his time is returned to me in the form of a text document.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now I have a draft and I’m taking the next step. I ask Monica to take a look at it and suggest changes. Again, it’s another hour and I’ve got back a pull request with changes, corrections, new assumptions, new risks, and new concerns. I’m not talking to Monica—there is no need for that. She has all the information she needs to work with the DB schema. She is a good engineer, and I &lt;a href=&quot;/2017/11/21/trust-pay-lose.html&quot;&gt;trust&lt;/a&gt; her ability to formulate her opinion in a written format.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There’s no need to sit together in the same room or stand at a whiteboard. Monica is smart enough to do this job by herself. She already has all the ideas expressed by Jeff in front of her; there is no need for her to talk to him either.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;youtube&quot;&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dE0_j4Kk6jo&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;box&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dE0_j4Kk6jo/mqdefault.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;YouTube video #dE0_j4Kk6jo&quot; /&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;play&quot;&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;icon icon-play&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;div&gt;Meetings Help Us and Kill Our Projects; 6 April 2016.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;Once I merge her pull request (after a proper review and corrections), I have a new version of my &lt;code&gt;schema.md&lt;/code&gt; document.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Moreover, I have a Git history of this document, and I have a history of pull requests with comments. This is way better than meeting notes or even a meeting video. Anyone who joins the project later will be able to understand how we came to the conclusion of using PostgreSQL and storing monetary amounts without cents. It’s all there in the Git history and GitHub tickets, forever with us.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What if I need more opinions? Or if I’m still not sure the schema is good enough? No problem; I ask someone else to review it one more time and send me a pull request with changes. I can even ask Jeff to do it again after a few iterations with other programmers!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Moreover, I can add my own concerns to the document, and on the next iteration, ask Jeff to pay attention to and resolve them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Train and discipline yourself to work with documents and let juniors enjoy their meetings.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;The more we circle this document, the better it becomes. And every minute the project pays for turns into a tangible product: a &lt;em&gt;document&lt;/em&gt; with a change history!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That’s how a professional architect collects opinions and makes complex decisions. Now let’s see what a bad architect would do.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;a-bad-architect&quot;&gt;A Bad Architect&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;I first call a meeting. No, wait; I schedule it in Google Calendar. No, wait, wait. First of all, I create an agenda:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;1. Introduction: 10 min 2. Problem: 15 min - We need a DB schema - Let&amp;#39;s choose a server 3. Opinions: 15 min - Jeff and Monica have experience - Others? 4. Coffee break: 10 min 5. Discussion: 30 min - Let&amp;#39;s not forget risks - Ask Joe about PostgreSQL 6. Conclusions: 10 min&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;I’m sure you know what I’m talking about and you’ve seen these agendas from your “architects.” Anyway, my first step is done. I’ve scheduled an hour-and-a-half meeting where all programmers will be present. We’ll have fun and drink coffee. We’ll discuss the problem, hear all opinions, and find the best solution. We’ll document it in that &lt;code&gt;schema.md&lt;/code&gt; and get back to our tasks.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Instead of circulating those &lt;em&gt;dry&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;boring&lt;/em&gt; Git documents, we’ll have a real human communication with a nice coffee break where we’ll share our opinions about the last episode of The Bing Bang Theory. Isn’t that what we all like about our &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/10/06/how-to-be-good-office-slave.html&quot;&gt;office jobs&lt;/a&gt; anyway?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;youtube&quot;&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwrMKTFyohg&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;box&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AwrMKTFyohg/mqdefault.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;YouTube video #AwrMKTFyohg&quot; /&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;play&quot;&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;icon icon-play&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;div&gt;#NoMagic; 13 April 2018.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;I don’t think so.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I think meetings demotivate, waste time, burn money, and degrade quality. Those who organize them either have no idea what they are doing or are silently &lt;em&gt;robbing&lt;/em&gt; the company they’re working for.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We needed meetings 30 years ago when we didn’t have laptops and GitHub. But even then, we had a pen and paper.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I’m talking about meetings that are intended to collect or distribute information, discuss or propose something, or find a solution in a &lt;em&gt;technical&lt;/em&gt; domain. The only &lt;em&gt;valid purpose&lt;/em&gt; of meetings is to read &lt;em&gt;body language&lt;/em&gt; of the people you are dealing with. Politicians, businessmen, poker players, shrinks, physicians, etc.—they need meetings because they must read our bodies, not just our thoughts.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Do we really care about Monica’s body while we’re designing a DB schema? Well, that depends, right? But let’s be serious; we’re not paid for that.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;meetings-demotivate&quot;&gt;Meetings Demotivate&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The best motivation for a creative person is to see the &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/07/21/hourly-pay-modern-slavery.html&quot;&gt;results&lt;/a&gt; of his or her creativity. If I’m not mistaken, enjoying the process of creativity without any results is an obvious sign of mental illness. A healthy and creative person like a software engineer, for example, wants to see how his or her efforts are turned into something &lt;em&gt;valuable&lt;/em&gt; and, preferably, &lt;em&gt;tangible&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Meetings almost never produce anything tangible and rarely something valuable. Sometimes we have “minutes” of our meetings, but they are just short pieces of paper with a brief summary of what we were talking about. Not a real “&lt;em&gt;product&lt;/em&gt;” for a creative person.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thus, they demotivate me because I simply don’t see what &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/07/21/hourly-pay-modern-slavery.html&quot;&gt;two hours&lt;/a&gt; of my life were turned into. We don’t really &lt;em&gt;create&lt;/em&gt; anything there, we just &lt;em&gt;discuss&lt;/em&gt;. Pay attention here; I’m talking about meetings, not about collaborative work on something, like in pair programming, for example.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Did Einstein invent his theory at a meeting with his colleagues?&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;You may say that some meetings actually produce great ideas, which are very tangible results. You may say that only in a direct, face-to-face setting could these ideas be born. You may also say that many bright technical decisions were invented precisely due to a magic synergy of &lt;em&gt;friends&lt;/em&gt; thinking in the same direction, at the same time, and in the same room. This argument makes sense, but I’ll address that later.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;meetings-waste-time&quot;&gt;Meetings Waste Time&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;I think it’s obvious. For the first few minutes of the meeting, you’re concentrated; then you start checking your Twitter feed and doodling. Everybody is doing the same—not because we’re &lt;a href=&quot;/2018/04/17/how-to-be-lazy.html&quot;&gt;lazy&lt;/a&gt; but because there is &lt;em&gt;no demand&lt;/em&gt; for our full focus at the meeting.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;youtube&quot;&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pt9uHp35fwM&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;box&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pt9uHp35fwM/mqdefault.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;YouTube video #pt9uHp35fwM&quot; /&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;play&quot;&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;icon icon-play&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;div&gt;Meetings Or Discipline; 26 April 2016.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;While Monica is working with the document, making comments and suggestions, she is &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/11/21/ringelmann-effect-vs-agile.html&quot;&gt;fully concentrated&lt;/a&gt; on the result—mostly because there is nobody else to &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/02/16/it-is-not-a-school.html&quot;&gt;help&lt;/a&gt; her. She has to deliver that pull request, and I’m waiting for her. Her concentration is as high as it would be at the meeting, when someone is asking her a direct question and she has to provide a detailed answer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Her time is optimized for a suitable outcome while everybody else is doing something else.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At the meeting, on the other hand, we’re all concentrating sparingly at best. And the longer the meeting, the slower we are. Also, the more people who are there, the less we care and the more interested we become in our Facebook updates. I reckon that’s not much of a surprise to you if you’ve been in the software development industry for at least a few months.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;meetings-burn-money&quot;&gt;Meetings Burn Money&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;This aligns closely with the previous conclusion. Meetings are among the biggest budget consumers of any type of activity in a project, simply because they pay &lt;em&gt;everybody&lt;/em&gt; who is sitting in that room or on that Skype conference while the result they produce is almost equal to what a single person can deliver. Or much less.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Even though this may sound extreme, I have to say that I consider meetings a legalized way to &lt;em&gt;rob&lt;/em&gt; a project. Most meeting organizers (architects, CTOs, CEOs, programmers, etc.) don’t realize that. They believe the more they talk, the better engineers they are. And their bosses, by mistake, appreciate that sort of activity from their subordinates.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s robbery!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I told you to create a draft of a DB schema. Now you’re coming to me and asking for a meeting because certain “aspects” are not clear? Did you study software engineering anywhere? Do you know how to work with technical documents? Are you capable of writing in a way that everybody else can understand and respond to you, also in writing? No? Now you want the project to not only pay you for the DB schema draft but to also pay me for talking to you and for a few other guys to sit next to us and text their friends? You basically want to rob the owner of this project. No more, no less.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;meetings-degrade-quality&quot;&gt;Meetings Degrade Quality&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Quality goes up when it is being &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/08/13/strict-code-quality-control.html&quot;&gt;controlled&lt;/a&gt;. When someone tells me every day that my code is buggy and needs improvements, my quality goes up. When nobody cares what I do or how good my results are, my quality goes &lt;em&gt;down&lt;/em&gt;, no matter how self-motivated I am.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Meetings promote group achievements and &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/11/21/ringelmann-effect-vs-agile.html&quot;&gt;discourage&lt;/a&gt; individual ones. At the end of a meeting, it’s often not clear who exactly suggested a good idea and who made the biggest effort. In other words, at the end of a meeting, I don’t know how good I am. Am I still the same as a month ago or am I a &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/10/29/how-much-do-you-cost.html&quot;&gt;better&lt;/a&gt; engineer?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They smile more and ask me “what do you think?” more frequently than last summer; that must mean something, right? I’m sure you understand this is not the kind of feedback a serious engineer would expect.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A serious software developer wants to produce tangible results and receive tangible feedback, like money or &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/02/09/serious-code-reviewer.html&quot;&gt;code reviews&lt;/a&gt;. I want to know what was wrong in my DB schema draft and what I missed. And I want this to be documented somewhere. This is what makes me better, and this is how I &lt;em&gt;learn&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;grow&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;what-about-the-a-ha-moment&quot;&gt;What About the A-ha! Moment?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now, what about true creativity or that well-known “a-ha!” moment? Sometimes it’s necessary to “think out loud” in order to invent something, right? We all know how important a face-to-face interaction could be when we’re researching and developing something new. Where would we be without meetings? We can’t simply work with documents; we need to talk to each other in order to let our ideas out. Isn’t it obvious?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I have only one argument for that. Did Einstein invent his theory at a meeting with his colleagues? I don’t think so. And he was solving a much bigger problem than a DB schema design.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;hr /&gt; &lt;p&gt;Let me summarize. Meetings are an activity that requires almost no skill, while documenting ideas in text and diagrams is a way more difficult job to do. So train and discipline yourself to work with documents and let juniors enjoy their meetings.&lt;/p&gt; " /> <meta name="keywords" content="next, path, output, content, previous, url, relative_path, id, collection, excerpt, draft, categories, layout, title, date, tags, place, description, keywords, image, jb_picture, slug, ext" /> <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1"/> <meta name="google-site-verification" content="JEj_gQr2CPe2QKGw8XdMz0R7VboQIUbX3FlM-lwTq-8" /> <meta name="author" content="Yegor Bugayenko"> <meta name="article:published_time" content="2015-07-13 00:00:00 +0000"> <meta name="og:site_name" content="Yegor Bugayenko"/> <meta name="og:type" content="article" /> <meta name="og:locale" content="en_US" /> <meta name="twitter:account_id" content="4503599630178231" /> <meta name="twitter:creator" content="@yegor256"/> <meta name="twitter:site" content="@yegor256"/> <meta name="twitter:title" property="og:title" content="Meetings Are Legalized Robbery"/> <meta name="twitter:description" property="og:description" content="&lt;p&gt;Software development is all about creativity, right?

There’s no doubt meetings are the key component of the modern software design discipline … and it’s very &lt;em&gt;sad&lt;/em&gt; to see it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;!--more--&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;jb_picture&quot;&gt;&lt;img itemprop=&quot;image&quot; alt=&quot;Heat (1995) by Michael Mann&quot; src=&quot;/images/2015/07/heat.jpg&quot; longdesc=&quot;#6d0fa212&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption id=&quot;6d0fa212&quot;&gt;Heat (1995) by Michael Mann&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;A good &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/10/12/who-is-software-architect.html&quot;&gt;software architect&lt;/a&gt;, as well as a &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/09/22/micromanagement.html&quot;&gt;good project manager&lt;/a&gt;, doesn’t need &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/01/08/morning-standup-meetings.html&quot;&gt;meetings&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; organizes them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;youtube&quot;&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibT5oKToMoQ&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;box&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ibT5oKToMoQ/mqdefault.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;YouTube video #ibT5oKToMoQ&quot; /&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;play&quot;&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;icon icon-play&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;div&gt;Daily Stand-Up Meetings Are Evil (webinar #11); 3 February 2016.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;Meetings demotivate, waste time, burn money, and degrade quality. But more about that later. For now, let’s discuss a proposed alternative.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Say I’m an architect who needs to design the schema for a relational database in a new project, and I have a team of five programmers whom I want to help me with this design. That’s a very logical and appropriate desire, as a good architect always discusses all possible options with available team members before making a final decision. So I call a meeting? No!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;a-good-architect&quot;&gt;A Good Architect&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;I ask Jeff, one of our programmers, to create a draft of the DB schema, but I don’t actually talk to him about it. I value and respect his time—there’s no need to bother him with this organizational noise, so I just create a ticket and assign it to Jeff. When he has time, he creates a draft and returns a pull request. I review it and make some comments before he updates the branch, and finally &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/07/24/rultor-automated-merging.html&quot;&gt;I merge it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;youtube&quot;&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LB_YLWhGrco&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;box&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LB_YLWhGrco/mqdefault.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;YouTube video #LB_YLWhGrco&quot; /&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;play&quot;&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;icon icon-play&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;div&gt;Meetings-free Programming; 1 April 2016.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;Perfect; we have a draft.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At the end of the document, Jeff also listed assumptions, risks, and concerns. For example, this is what I got back from him (it’s Markdown, a very convenient format for simple technical documents; I highly recommend it):&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;## Tables user (id INT, name VARCHAR, email VARCHAR); payment (id INT, date DATETIME, amount INT); order (id INT, details VARCHAR, user_id INT FK(user)); ## Assumptions - All payments will be in whole dollars, no cents. - All users will have only one email. - There will be no search feature required. ## Risks - Order details may not fit into VARCHAR. - Foreign keys may not be supported in the DBMS. ## Concerns - Would NoSQL be more suitable? - What is the DB server we&amp;#39;ll use?&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;I don’t know how much time Jeff would have spent on this document, but I just created it in 10 minutes. Of course, it’s a very simple schema for a very simple project. But even if Jeff spent an hour on it, every minute of that hour is valuable to the project. What I mean is that every dollar I pay Jeff for his time is returned to me in the form of a text document.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now I have a draft and I’m taking the next step. I ask Monica to take a look at it and suggest changes. Again, it’s another hour and I’ve got back a pull request with changes, corrections, new assumptions, new risks, and new concerns. I’m not talking to Monica—there is no need for that. She has all the information she needs to work with the DB schema. She is a good engineer, and I &lt;a href=&quot;/2017/11/21/trust-pay-lose.html&quot;&gt;trust&lt;/a&gt; her ability to formulate her opinion in a written format.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There’s no need to sit together in the same room or stand at a whiteboard. Monica is smart enough to do this job by herself. She already has all the ideas expressed by Jeff in front of her; there is no need for her to talk to him either.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;youtube&quot;&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dE0_j4Kk6jo&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;box&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dE0_j4Kk6jo/mqdefault.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;YouTube video #dE0_j4Kk6jo&quot; /&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;play&quot;&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;icon icon-play&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;div&gt;Meetings Help Us and Kill Our Projects; 6 April 2016.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;Once I merge her pull request (after a proper review and corrections), I have a new version of my &lt;code&gt;schema.md&lt;/code&gt; document.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Moreover, I have a Git history of this document, and I have a history of pull requests with comments. This is way better than meeting notes or even a meeting video. Anyone who joins the project later will be able to understand how we came to the conclusion of using PostgreSQL and storing monetary amounts without cents. It’s all there in the Git history and GitHub tickets, forever with us.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What if I need more opinions? Or if I’m still not sure the schema is good enough? No problem; I ask someone else to review it one more time and send me a pull request with changes. I can even ask Jeff to do it again after a few iterations with other programmers!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Moreover, I can add my own concerns to the document, and on the next iteration, ask Jeff to pay attention to and resolve them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Train and discipline yourself to work with documents and let juniors enjoy their meetings.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;The more we circle this document, the better it becomes. And every minute the project pays for turns into a tangible product: a &lt;em&gt;document&lt;/em&gt; with a change history!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That’s how a professional architect collects opinions and makes complex decisions. Now let’s see what a bad architect would do.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;a-bad-architect&quot;&gt;A Bad Architect&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;I first call a meeting. No, wait; I schedule it in Google Calendar. No, wait, wait. First of all, I create an agenda:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;1. Introduction: 10 min 2. Problem: 15 min - We need a DB schema - Let&amp;#39;s choose a server 3. Opinions: 15 min - Jeff and Monica have experience - Others? 4. Coffee break: 10 min 5. Discussion: 30 min - Let&amp;#39;s not forget risks - Ask Joe about PostgreSQL 6. Conclusions: 10 min&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;I’m sure you know what I’m talking about and you’ve seen these agendas from your “architects.” Anyway, my first step is done. I’ve scheduled an hour-and-a-half meeting where all programmers will be present. We’ll have fun and drink coffee. We’ll discuss the problem, hear all opinions, and find the best solution. We’ll document it in that &lt;code&gt;schema.md&lt;/code&gt; and get back to our tasks.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Instead of circulating those &lt;em&gt;dry&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;boring&lt;/em&gt; Git documents, we’ll have a real human communication with a nice coffee break where we’ll share our opinions about the last episode of The Bing Bang Theory. Isn’t that what we all like about our &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/10/06/how-to-be-good-office-slave.html&quot;&gt;office jobs&lt;/a&gt; anyway?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;youtube&quot;&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwrMKTFyohg&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;box&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AwrMKTFyohg/mqdefault.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;YouTube video #AwrMKTFyohg&quot; /&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;play&quot;&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;icon icon-play&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;div&gt;#NoMagic; 13 April 2018.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;I don’t think so.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I think meetings demotivate, waste time, burn money, and degrade quality. Those who organize them either have no idea what they are doing or are silently &lt;em&gt;robbing&lt;/em&gt; the company they’re working for.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We needed meetings 30 years ago when we didn’t have laptops and GitHub. But even then, we had a pen and paper.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I’m talking about meetings that are intended to collect or distribute information, discuss or propose something, or find a solution in a &lt;em&gt;technical&lt;/em&gt; domain. The only &lt;em&gt;valid purpose&lt;/em&gt; of meetings is to read &lt;em&gt;body language&lt;/em&gt; of the people you are dealing with. Politicians, businessmen, poker players, shrinks, physicians, etc.—they need meetings because they must read our bodies, not just our thoughts.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Do we really care about Monica’s body while we’re designing a DB schema? Well, that depends, right? But let’s be serious; we’re not paid for that.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;meetings-demotivate&quot;&gt;Meetings Demotivate&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The best motivation for a creative person is to see the &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/07/21/hourly-pay-modern-slavery.html&quot;&gt;results&lt;/a&gt; of his or her creativity. If I’m not mistaken, enjoying the process of creativity without any results is an obvious sign of mental illness. A healthy and creative person like a software engineer, for example, wants to see how his or her efforts are turned into something &lt;em&gt;valuable&lt;/em&gt; and, preferably, &lt;em&gt;tangible&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Meetings almost never produce anything tangible and rarely something valuable. Sometimes we have “minutes” of our meetings, but they are just short pieces of paper with a brief summary of what we were talking about. Not a real “&lt;em&gt;product&lt;/em&gt;” for a creative person.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thus, they demotivate me because I simply don’t see what &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/07/21/hourly-pay-modern-slavery.html&quot;&gt;two hours&lt;/a&gt; of my life were turned into. We don’t really &lt;em&gt;create&lt;/em&gt; anything there, we just &lt;em&gt;discuss&lt;/em&gt;. Pay attention here; I’m talking about meetings, not about collaborative work on something, like in pair programming, for example.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Did Einstein invent his theory at a meeting with his colleagues?&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;You may say that some meetings actually produce great ideas, which are very tangible results. You may say that only in a direct, face-to-face setting could these ideas be born. You may also say that many bright technical decisions were invented precisely due to a magic synergy of &lt;em&gt;friends&lt;/em&gt; thinking in the same direction, at the same time, and in the same room. This argument makes sense, but I’ll address that later.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;meetings-waste-time&quot;&gt;Meetings Waste Time&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;I think it’s obvious. For the first few minutes of the meeting, you’re concentrated; then you start checking your Twitter feed and doodling. Everybody is doing the same—not because we’re &lt;a href=&quot;/2018/04/17/how-to-be-lazy.html&quot;&gt;lazy&lt;/a&gt; but because there is &lt;em&gt;no demand&lt;/em&gt; for our full focus at the meeting.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;youtube&quot;&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pt9uHp35fwM&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;box&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pt9uHp35fwM/mqdefault.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;YouTube video #pt9uHp35fwM&quot; /&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;play&quot;&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;icon icon-play&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;div&gt;Meetings Or Discipline; 26 April 2016.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;While Monica is working with the document, making comments and suggestions, she is &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/11/21/ringelmann-effect-vs-agile.html&quot;&gt;fully concentrated&lt;/a&gt; on the result—mostly because there is nobody else to &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/02/16/it-is-not-a-school.html&quot;&gt;help&lt;/a&gt; her. She has to deliver that pull request, and I’m waiting for her. Her concentration is as high as it would be at the meeting, when someone is asking her a direct question and she has to provide a detailed answer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Her time is optimized for a suitable outcome while everybody else is doing something else.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At the meeting, on the other hand, we’re all concentrating sparingly at best. And the longer the meeting, the slower we are. Also, the more people who are there, the less we care and the more interested we become in our Facebook updates. I reckon that’s not much of a surprise to you if you’ve been in the software development industry for at least a few months.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;meetings-burn-money&quot;&gt;Meetings Burn Money&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;This aligns closely with the previous conclusion. Meetings are among the biggest budget consumers of any type of activity in a project, simply because they pay &lt;em&gt;everybody&lt;/em&gt; who is sitting in that room or on that Skype conference while the result they produce is almost equal to what a single person can deliver. Or much less.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Even though this may sound extreme, I have to say that I consider meetings a legalized way to &lt;em&gt;rob&lt;/em&gt; a project. Most meeting organizers (architects, CTOs, CEOs, programmers, etc.) don’t realize that. They believe the more they talk, the better engineers they are. And their bosses, by mistake, appreciate that sort of activity from their subordinates.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s robbery!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I told you to create a draft of a DB schema. Now you’re coming to me and asking for a meeting because certain “aspects” are not clear? Did you study software engineering anywhere? Do you know how to work with technical documents? Are you capable of writing in a way that everybody else can understand and respond to you, also in writing? No? Now you want the project to not only pay you for the DB schema draft but to also pay me for talking to you and for a few other guys to sit next to us and text their friends? You basically want to rob the owner of this project. No more, no less.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;meetings-degrade-quality&quot;&gt;Meetings Degrade Quality&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Quality goes up when it is being &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/08/13/strict-code-quality-control.html&quot;&gt;controlled&lt;/a&gt;. When someone tells me every day that my code is buggy and needs improvements, my quality goes up. When nobody cares what I do or how good my results are, my quality goes &lt;em&gt;down&lt;/em&gt;, no matter how self-motivated I am.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Meetings promote group achievements and &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/11/21/ringelmann-effect-vs-agile.html&quot;&gt;discourage&lt;/a&gt; individual ones. At the end of a meeting, it’s often not clear who exactly suggested a good idea and who made the biggest effort. In other words, at the end of a meeting, I don’t know how good I am. Am I still the same as a month ago or am I a &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/10/29/how-much-do-you-cost.html&quot;&gt;better&lt;/a&gt; engineer?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They smile more and ask me “what do you think?” more frequently than last summer; that must mean something, right? I’m sure you understand this is not the kind of feedback a serious engineer would expect.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A serious software developer wants to produce tangible results and receive tangible feedback, like money or &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/02/09/serious-code-reviewer.html&quot;&gt;code reviews&lt;/a&gt;. I want to know what was wrong in my DB schema draft and what I missed. And I want this to be documented somewhere. This is what makes me better, and this is how I &lt;em&gt;learn&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;grow&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;what-about-the-a-ha-moment&quot;&gt;What About the A-ha! Moment?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now, what about true creativity or that well-known “a-ha!” moment? Sometimes it’s necessary to “think out loud” in order to invent something, right? We all know how important a face-to-face interaction could be when we’re researching and developing something new. Where would we be without meetings? We can’t simply work with documents; we need to talk to each other in order to let our ideas out. Isn’t it obvious?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I have only one argument for that. Did Einstein invent his theory at a meeting with his colleagues? I don’t think so. And he was solving a much bigger problem than a DB schema design.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;hr /&gt; &lt;p&gt;Let me summarize. Meetings are an activity that requires almost no skill, while documenting ideas in text and diagrams is a way more difficult job to do. So train and discipline yourself to work with documents and let juniors enjoy their meetings.&lt;/p&gt; "/> <meta name="twitter:url" property="og:url"

development is all about creativity, right? It’s an art, not a science. As software engineers, we solve complex problems, and often our solutions are absolutely not obvious. We experiment, innovate, research, and investigate. To do all this, we <em>talk</em>. We sit together in our meeting rooms, Skype conference calls, or Slack channels; we discuss our solutions; we ask our coworkers for their opinions; and we argue about the best ideas. There’s no doubt meetings are the key component of the modern software design discipline … and it’s very <em>sad</em> to see it.</p><figure class="jb_picture"><img itemprop="image" alt="Heat (1995) by Michael Mann" src="/images/2015/07/heat.jpg" longdesc="#6d0fa212" /><figcaption id="6d0fa212">Heat (1995) by Michael Mann</figcaption></figure><p>A good <a href="/2014/10/12/who-is-software-architect.html">software architect</a>, as well as a <a href="/2015/09/22/micromanagement.html">good project manager</a>, doesn’t need <a href="/2015/01/08/morning-standup-meetings.html">meetings</a> and <em>never</em> organizes them.</p><aside class="youtube"> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibT5oKToMoQ"><div class="box"> <img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ibT5oKToMoQ/mqdefault.jpg" alt="YouTube video #ibT5oKToMoQ" /><div class="play"><i class="icon icon-play"></i></div></div></a><div>Daily Stand-Up Meetings Are Evil (webinar #11); 3 February 2016.</div></aside><p>Meetings demotivate, waste time, burn money, and degrade quality.

Now let’s see what a bad architect would do.</p><h2 id="a-bad-architect">A Bad Architect</h2><p>I first call a meeting. No, wait; I schedule it in Google Calendar. No, wait, wait. First of all, I create an agenda:</p><figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text"><span></span>1. Introduction: 10 min
2. Problem: 15 min
  - We need a DB schema
  - Let&#39;s choose a server

  - Others?
4. Coffee break: 10 min
5. Discussion: 30 min
  - Let&#39;s not forget risks
  - Ask Joe about PostgreSQL
6. Conclusions: 10 min</code></pre></figure><p>I’m sure you know what I’m talking about and you’ve seen these agendas from your “architects.” Anyway, my first step is done. I’ve scheduled an hour-and-a-half meeting where all programmers will be present. We’ll have fun and drink coffee. We’ll discuss the problem, hear all opinions, and find the best solution. We’ll document it in that <code>schema.md</code> and get back to our tasks.</p><p>Instead of circulating those <em>dry</em> and <em>boring</em> Git documents, we’ll have a real human communication with a nice coffee break where we’ll share our opinions about the last episode of The Bing Bang Theory. Isn’t that what we all like about our <a href="/2015/10/06/how-to-be-good-office-slave.html">office jobs</a> anyway?</p><aside class="youtube"> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwrMKTFyohg"><div class="box"> <img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AwrMKTFyohg/mqdefault.jpg" alt="YouTube video #AwrMKTFyohg" /><div class="play"><i class="icon icon-play"></i></div></div></a><div>#NoMagic; 13 April 2018.</div></aside><p>I don’t think so.</p><p>I think meetings demotivate, waste time, burn money, and degrade quality. Those who organize them either have no idea what they are doing or are silently <em>robbing</em> the company they’re working for.</p><p>We needed meetings 30 years ago when we didn’t have laptops and GitHub. But even then, we had a pen and paper.</p><p>I’m talking about meetings that are intended to collect or distribute information, discuss or propose something, or find a solution in a <em>technical</em> domain. The only <em>valid purpose</em> of meetings is to read <em>body language</em> of the people you are dealing with. Politicians, businessmen, poker players, shrinks, physicians, etc.—they need meetings because they must read our bodies, not just our thoughts.</p><p>Do we really care about Monica’s body while we’re designing a DB schema? Well, that depends, right? But let’s be serious; we’re not paid for that.</p><h2 id="meetings-demotivate">Meetings Demotivate</h2><p>The best motivation for a creative person is to see the <a href="/2015/07/21/hourly-pay-modern-slavery.html">results</a> of his or her creativity. If I’m not mistaken, enjoying the process of creativity without any results is an obvious sign of mental illness. A healthy and creative person like a software engineer, for example, wants to see how his or her efforts are turned into something <em>valuable</em> and, preferably, <em>tangible</em>.</p><p>Meetings almost never produce anything tangible and rarely something valuable. Sometimes we have “minutes” of our meetings, but they are just short pieces of paper with a brief summary of what we were talking about. Not a real “<em>product</em>” for a creative person.</p><p>Thus, they demotivate me because I simply don’t see what <a href="/2015/07/21/hourly-pay-modern-slavery.html">two hours</a> of my life were turned into. We don’t really <em>create</em> anything there, we just <em>discuss</em>. Pay attention here; I’m talking about meetings, not about collaborative work on something, like in pair programming, for example.</p><aside class="quote">Did Einstein invent his theory at a meeting with his colleagues?</aside><p>You may say that some meetings actually produce great ideas, which are very tangible results. You may say that only in a direct, face-to-face setting could these ideas be born. You may also say that many bright technical decisions were invented precisely due to a magic synergy of <em>friends</em> thinking in the same direction, at the same time, and in the same room. This argument makes sense, but I’ll address that later.</p><h2 id="meetings-waste-time">Meetings Waste Time</h2><p>I think it’s obvious. For the first few minutes of the meeting, you’re concentrated; then you start checking your Twitter feed and doodling. Everybody is doing the same—not because we’re <a href="/2018/04/17/how-to-be-lazy.html">lazy</a> but because there is <em>no demand</em> for our full focus at the meeting.</p><aside class="youtube"> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pt9uHp35fwM"><div class="box"> <img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pt9uHp35fwM/mqdefault.jpg" alt="YouTube video #pt9uHp35fwM" /><div class="play"><i class="icon icon-play"></i></div></div></a><div>Meetings Or Discipline; 26 April 2016.</div></aside><p>While Monica is working with the document, making comments and suggestions, she is <a href="/2015/11/21/ringelmann-effect-vs-agile.html">fully concentrated</a> on the result—mostly because there is nobody else to <a href="/2015/02/16/it-is-not-a-school.html">help</a> her. She has to deliver that pull request, and I’m waiting for her. Her concentration is as high as it would be at the meeting, when someone is asking her a direct question and she has to provide a detailed answer.</p><p>Her time is optimized for a suitable outcome while everybody else is doing something else.</p><p>At the meeting, on the other hand, we’re all concentrating sparingly at best. And the longer the meeting, the slower we are. Also, the more people who are there, the less we care and the more interested we become in our Facebook updates. I reckon that’s not much of a surprise to you if you’ve been in the software development industry for at least a few months.</p><h2 id="meetings-burn-money">Meetings Burn Money</h2><p>This aligns closely with the previous conclusion. Meetings are among the biggest budget consumers of any type of activity in a project, simply because they pay <em>everybody</em> who is sitting in that room or on that Skype conference while the result they produce is almost equal to what a single person can deliver. Or much less.</p><p>Even though this may sound extreme, I have to say that I consider meetings a legalized way to <em>rob</em> a project. Most meeting organizers (architects, CTOs, CEOs, programmers, etc.) don’t realize that. They believe the more they talk, the better engineers they are. And their bosses, by mistake, appreciate that sort of activity from their subordinates.</p><p>It’s robbery!</p><p>I told you to create a draft of a DB schema. Now you’re coming to me and asking for a meeting because certain “aspects” are not clear? Did you study software engineering anywhere? Do you know how to work with technical documents? Are you capable of writing in a way that everybody else can understand and respond to you, also in writing? No? Now you want the project to not only pay you for the DB schema draft but to also pay me for talking to you and for a few other guys to sit next to us and text their friends? You basically want to rob the owner of this project. No more, no less.</p><h2 id="meetings-degrade-quality">Meetings Degrade Quality</h2><p>Quality goes up when it is being <a href="/2014/08/13/strict-code-quality-control.html">controlled</a>. When someone tells me every day that my code is buggy and needs improvements, my quality goes up. When nobody cares what I do or how good my results are, my quality goes <em>down</em>, no matter how self-motivated I am.</p><p>Meetings promote group achievements and <a href="/2015/11/21/ringelmann-effect-vs-agile.html">discourage</a> individual ones. At the end of a meeting, it’s often not clear who exactly suggested a good idea and who made the biggest effort. In other words, at the end of a meeting, I don’t know how good I am. Am I still the same as a month ago or am I a <a href="/2014/10/29/how-much-do-you-cost.html">better</a> engineer?</p><p>They smile more and ask me “what do you think?” more frequently than last summer; that must mean something, right? I’m sure you understand this is not the kind of feedback a serious engineer would expect.</p><p>A serious software developer wants to produce tangible results and receive tangible feedback, like money or <a href="/2015/02/09/serious-code-reviewer.html">code reviews</a>. I want to know what was wrong in my DB schema draft and what I missed. And I want this to be documented somewhere. This is what makes me better, and this is how I <em>learn</em> and <em>grow</em>.</p><h2 id="what-about-the-a-ha-moment">What About the A-ha! Moment?</h2><p>Now, what about true creativity or that well-known “a-ha!” moment? Sometimes it’s necessary to “think out loud” in order to invent something, right? We all know how important a face-to-face interaction could be when we’re researching and developing something new. Where would we be without meetings? We can’t simply work with documents; we need to talk to each other in order to let our ideas out. Isn’t it obvious?</p><p>I have only one argument for that. Did Einstein invent his theory at a meeting with his colleagues? I don’t think so. And he was solving a much bigger problem than a DB schema design.</p><hr /><p>Let me summarize. Meetings are an activity that requires almost no skill, while documenting ideas in text and diagrams is a way more difficult job to do. So train and discipline yourself to work with documents and let juniors enjoy their meetings.</p></p><nav class="buttons notranslate desktop-only"> <a href="http://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://www.yegor256.com/2015/07/13/meetings-are-legalized-robbery.html" title="Share on Facebook" class="button" rel="nofollow"> <span class="count count-facebook">0</span> <i class="icon icon-facebook notranslate" aria-hidden="true"></i> </a> <a href="https://twitter.com/share?url=https://www.yegor256.com/2015/07/13/meetings-are-legalized-robbery.html&amp;text=Meetings+Are+Legalized+Robbery" title="Share on Twitter" class="button" rel="nofollow"> <span class="count count-twitter">0</span> <i class="icon icon-twitter notranslate" aria-hidden="true"></i> </a> <a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=https://www.yegor256.com/2015/07/13/meetings-are-legalized-robbery.html" title="Share on Google+" class="button" rel="nofollow"> <span class="count count-googleplus">0</span> <i class="icon icon-googleplus notranslate" aria-hidden="true"></i> </a> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/cws/share?url=https://www.yegor256.com/2015/07/13/meetings-are-legalized-robbery.html" title="Share on LinkedIn" class="button" rel="nofollow"> <span class="count count-linkedin">0</span> <i class="icon icon-linkedin notranslate" aria-hidden="true"></i> </a> <a href="http://reddit.com/submit?url=https://www.yegor256.com/2015/07/13/meetings-are-legalized-robbery.html%3F2015-28&amp;title=Meetings+Are+Legalized+Robbery" title="Share on Reddit" class="button" rel="nofollow"> <span class="count count-reddit">0</span> <i class="icon icon-reddit notranslate" aria-hidden="true"></i> </a> <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/submitlink?u=https://www.yegor256.com/2015/07/13/meetings-are-legalized-robbery.html%3F2015-28&amp;t=Meetings+Are+Legalized+Robbery" title="Share on Hacker News" class="button" rel="nofollow"> <span class="count count-hackernews">0</span> <i class="icon icon-hackernews notranslate" aria-hidden="true"></i> </a> </nav> </header> <article class="main" itemprop="articleBody"><div ><p>Software development is all about creativity, right?

Those who organize them either have no idea what they are doing or are silently <em>robbing</em> the company they’re working for.</p><p>We needed meetings 30 years ago when we didn’t have laptops and GitHub. But even then, we had a pen and paper.</p><p>I’m talking about meetings that are intended to collect or distribute information, discuss or propose something, or find a solution in a <em>technical</em> domain. The only <em>valid purpose</em> of meetings is to read <em>body language</em> of the people you are dealing with. Politicians, businessmen, poker players, shrinks, physicians, etc.—they need meetings because they must read our bodies, not just our thoughts.</p><p>Do we really care about Monica’s body while we’re designing a DB schema? Well, that depends, right? But let’s be serious; we’re not paid for that.</p><h2 id="meetings-demotivate">Meetings Demotivate</h2><p>The best motivation for a creative person is to see the <a href="/2015/07/21/hourly-pay-modern-slavery.html">results</a> of his or her creativity. If I’m not mistaken, enjoying the process of creativity without any results is an obvious sign of mental illness. A healthy and creative person like a software engineer, for example, wants to see how his or her efforts are turned into something <em>valuable</em> and, preferably, <em>tangible</em>.</p><p>Meetings almost never produce anything tangible and rarely something valuable. Sometimes we have “minutes” of our meetings, but they are just short pieces of paper with a brief summary of what we were talking about. Not a real “<em>product</em>” for a creative person.</p><p>Thus, they demotivate me because I simply don’t see what <a href="/2015/07/21/hourly-pay-modern-slavery.html">two hours</a> of my life were turned into. We don’t really <em>create</em> anything there, we just <em>discuss</em>. Pay attention here; I’m talking about meetings, not about collaborative work on something, like in pair programming, for example.</p><aside class="quote">Did Einstein invent his theory at a meeting with his colleagues?</aside><p>You may say that some meetings actually produce great ideas, which are very tangible results. You may say that only in a direct, face-to-face setting could these ideas be born. You may also say that many bright technical decisions were invented precisely due to a magic synergy of <em>friends</em> thinking in the same direction, at the same time, and in the same room. This argument makes sense, but I’ll address that later.</p><h2 id="meetings-waste-time">Meetings Waste Time</h2><p>I think it’s obvious. For the first few minutes of the meeting, you’re concentrated; then you start checking your Twitter feed and doodling. Everybody is doing the same—not because we’re <a href="/2018/04/17/how-to-be-lazy.html">lazy</a> but because there is <em>no demand</em> for our full focus at the meeting.</p><aside class="youtube"> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pt9uHp35fwM"><div class="box"> <img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pt9uHp35fwM/mqdefault.jpg" alt="YouTube video #pt9uHp35fwM" /><div class="play"><i class="icon icon-play"></i></div></div></a><div>Meetings Or Discipline; 26 April 2016.</div></aside><p>While Monica is working with the document, making comments and suggestions, she is <a href="/2015/11/21/ringelmann-effect-vs-agile.html">fully concentrated</a> on the result—mostly because there is nobody else to <a href="/2015/02/16/it-is-not-a-school.html">help</a> her. She has to deliver that pull request, and I’m waiting for her. Her concentration is as high as it would be at the meeting, when someone is asking her a direct question and she has to provide a detailed answer.</p><p>Her time is optimized for a suitable outcome while everybody else is doing something else.</p><p>At the meeting, on the other hand, we’re all concentrating sparingly at best. And the longer the meeting, the slower we are. Also, the more people who are there, the less we care and the more interested we become in our Facebook updates. I reckon that’s not much of a surprise to you if you’ve been in the software development industry for at least a few months.</p><h2 id="meetings-burn-money">Meetings Burn Money</h2><p>This aligns closely with the previous conclusion. Meetings are among the biggest budget consumers of any type of activity in a project, simply because they pay <em>everybody</em> who is sitting in that room or on that Skype conference while the result they produce is almost equal to what a single person can deliver. Or much less.</p><p>Even though this may sound extreme, I have to say that I consider meetings a legalized way to <em>rob</em> a project. Most meeting organizers (architects, CTOs, CEOs, programmers, etc.) don’t realize that. They believe the more they talk, the better engineers they are. And their bosses, by mistake, appreciate that sort of activity from their subordinates.</p><p>It’s robbery!</p><p>I told you to create a draft of a DB schema. Now you’re coming to me and asking for a meeting because certain “aspects” are not clear? Did you study software engineering anywhere? Do you know how to work with technical documents? Are you capable of writing in a way that everybody else can understand and respond to you, also in writing? No? Now you want the project to not only pay you for the DB schema draft but to also pay me for talking to you and for a few other guys to sit next to us and text their friends? You basically want to rob the owner of this project. No more, no less.</p><h2 id="meetings-degrade-quality">Meetings Degrade Quality</h2><p>Quality goes up when it is being <a href="/2014/08/13/strict-code-quality-control.html">controlled</a>. When someone tells me every day that my code is buggy and needs improvements, my quality goes up. When nobody cares what I do or how good my results are, my quality goes <em>down</em>, no matter how self-motivated I am.</p><p>Meetings promote group achievements and <a href="/2015/11/21/ringelmann-effect-vs-agile.html">discourage</a> individual ones. At the end of a meeting, it’s often not clear who exactly suggested a good idea and who made the biggest effort. In other words, at the end of a meeting, I don’t know how good I am. Am I still the same as a month ago or am I a <a href="/2014/10/29/how-much-do-you-cost.html">better</a> engineer?</p><p>They smile more and ask me “what do you think?” more frequently than last summer; that must mean something, right? I’m sure you understand this is not the kind of feedback a serious engineer would expect.</p><p>A serious software developer wants to produce tangible results and receive tangible feedback, like money or <a href="/2015/02/09/serious-code-reviewer.html">code reviews</a>. I want to know what was wrong in my DB schema draft and what I missed. And I want this to be documented somewhere. This is what makes me better, and this is how I <em>learn</em> and <em>grow</em>.</p><h2 id="what-about-the-a-ha-moment">What About the A-ha! Moment?</h2><p>Now, what about true creativity or that well-known “a-ha!” moment? Sometimes it’s necessary to “think out loud” in order to invent something, right? We all know how important a face-to-face interaction could be when we’re researching and developing something new. Where would we be without meetings? We can’t simply work with documents; we need to talk to each other in order to let our ideas out. Isn’t it obvious?</p><p>I have only one argument for that. Did Einstein invent his theory at a meeting with his colleagues? I don’t think so. And he was solving a much bigger problem than a DB schema design.</p><hr /><p>Let me summarize. Meetings are an activity that requires almost no skill, while documenting ideas in text and diagrams is a way more difficult job to do. So train and discipline yourself to work with documents and let juniors enjoy their meetings.</p></div></article></div><div class="wrapper"> <related-posts /></div><div class="disqus" role="complementary"><p class="disqus_hint"> Please, use <a href="https://help.disqus.com/commenting/what-html-tags-are-allowed-within-comments">syntax highlighting</a> in your comments, to make them more readable.</p><div id="disqus_thread" class="disqus-thread"> <a>&nbsp;</a></div><script> var disqus_config = function () { this.page.url = document.location.href.split('?')[0].split('#')[0].replace('https://', 'http://'); this.page.identifier = this.page.url; }; (function() { var d = document, s = d.createElement('script'); s.src = '//yegor256.disqus.com/embed.js'; s.setAttribute('data-timestamp', +new Date()); (d.head || d.body).appendChild(s); })(); </script> <noscript><div><p class="red"> JavaScript is disabled in your browser, that's why you can't see comments under this post.</p></div></noscript></div><div class="wrapper"> <footer class="footer"><p> &copy; <span itemscope="" itemprop="copyrightHolder" itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"> <span itemprop="name">Yegor Bugayenko</span> </span> 2014&ndash;<span itemprop="copyrightYear">2018</span></p></footer></div></section><div class="wrapper unprintable" style="text-align:center;margin-top:2em;"> <a href="http://www.sixnines.io/h/3ba1652f"> <img src="//www.sixnines.io/b/3ba1652f?style=flat" alt="sixnines availability badge"/> </a></div><script src="//code.jquery.com/jquery-1.9.0.min.js"></script> <script src="/js/all.js?c998b88f617"></script> <script>var disqus_shortname = 'yegor256';</script> <script id="dsq-count-scr" src="//yegor256.disqus.com/count.js" async="async"></script> <script> (function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){ (i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o), m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m) })(window,document,'script','//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga'); ga('create', 'UA-1963507-32', 'auto'); ga('send', 'pageview'); </script> <script> Cd=document;Cr="&"+Math.random();Cp="&s=1"; Cd.cookie="b=b";if(Cd.cookie)Cp+="&c=1"; Cp+="&t="+(new Date()).getTimezoneOffset(); if(self!=top)Cp+="&f=1"; </script> <script> if(navigator.javaEnabled())Cp+="&j=1"; </script> <script> if(typeof(screen)!='undefined')Cp+="&w="+screen.width+"&h="+ screen.height+"&d="+(screen.colorDepth?screen.colorDepth:screen.pixelDepth); </script> <script> Cd.write("<img src='//c.hit.ua/hit?i=95870&g=0&x=2"+Cp+Cr+ "&r="+escape(Cd.referrer)+"&u="+escape(window.location.href)+ "' border='0' wi"+"dth='1' he"+"ight='1'/>"); </script> <script type="application/ld+json"> { "@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Person", "name": "Yegor Bugayenko", "url": "https://www.yegor256.com", "sameAs": [ "https://www.facebook.com/yegor256", "https://instagram.com/yegor256", "https://www.linkedin.com/in/yegor256", "https://twitter.com/yegor256", "https://github.com/yegor256", "https://www.pinterest.com/yegor256/" ] } </script> </body> </html> <!DOCTYPE html> <html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/WebSite"> <head> <meta charset="utf-8"/> <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A bug exists when something doesn’t work as expected. A &lt;em&gt;bug fix&lt;/em&gt; is basically a patch (a pull request) to the existing code base that is supposed to solve the problem and make sure that “something” works as expected. Very often, such a patch fixes one thing and breaks many others. I believe that sometimes it’s necessary to &lt;em&gt;reject&lt;/em&gt; a bug fix and ask its author to re-do the patch in order to protect the project from bigger problems. There are a few valid reasons for such a rejection, according to my experience.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;!--more--&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;jb_picture&quot;&gt;&lt;img itemprop=&quot;image&quot; alt=&quot;El Crimen Perfecto (2004) by Álex de la Iglesia&quot; src=&quot;/images/2015/06/crimen-ferpecto.jpg&quot; longdesc=&quot;#3827b7b3&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption id=&quot;3827b7b3&quot;&gt;El Crimen Perfecto (2004) by Álex de la Iglesia&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;it-degrades-code-coverage&quot;&gt;It Degrades Code Coverage&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is a very common situation: After the changes are made in one place, unit tests fail in some other place. The bug is fixed, but some possibly unrelated unit tests start to report failure. Under pressure or simply because we’re lazy, we don’t fix them; we simply remove the tests or mark them as temporarily “skipped.” The problem is solved, the build is clean, so let’s merge the patch and call it a day, right? Wrong!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Even though I’m in favor of &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/01/15/how-to-cut-corners.html&quot;&gt;cutting corners&lt;/a&gt; as much as possible, this is the corner I don’t recommend you cut.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The unit tests are there precisely to prevent us from breaking the product when under pressure.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Obviously, there are situations when the unit tests are wrong and we have to delete them. In those cases, don’t forget to create new ones.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;badge&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/1SdcZ8M&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.yegor256.com/images/2015/04/book-legacy.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width:96px;max-width:100%;&quot; alt=&quot;badge&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are also situations when the bug must be fixed in a few minutes to put the system back online and fixing all unit tests will take an hour. Such a situation is a strong indicator that you’ve got a terrible underlying situation with test coverage in the product. There’s no doubt that we have to make a fix and ask our tests to shut up for some time. But in this case, make sure the next task your team is working on after the bug fix is released is correcting those disabled unit tests. I would recommend reading &lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/1SdcZ8M&quot;&gt;Working Effectively With Legacy Code&lt;/a&gt; by Michael Feathers, which tackles this very subject.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;it-doesnt-reproduce-the-issue&quot;&gt;It Doesn’t Reproduce the Issue&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sometimes the entire system may be down simply because of a small typo in one line of code. An obvious bug fix is to remove the typo, but that’s not what a good project is expecting from us if we care about its quality. The problem is not the typo but rather the absence of unit tests that would catch the typo at the deployment phase.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;The problem is not the typo but rather the absence of unit tests that would catch the typo at the deployment phase&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;The real problem is the lack of test code coverage in this particular section of the code. By removing the typo, we’re not helping the project in any way. Moreover, we’re doing it a disservice—we’re &lt;em&gt;concealing&lt;/em&gt; the real problem.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thus, no matter how small or cosmetic the issue is, its bug fix must contain an extra test that first reproduces the bug. Without such a test, a bug fix is a waste of the project’s money.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Furthermore, without a unit test reproducing the issue, there is no guarantee that our bug fix doesn’t introduce more bugs. I would even say that the more bug fixes we have, the higher the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_%28information_theory%29&quot;&gt;entropy&lt;/a&gt;. And the only way to decrease this uncertainty is by covering the code with unit tests.

It’s a very typical mistake for programmers to get carried away while fixing a bug and introduce some refactoring together with a fix. The result is that the patch gets rather big and difficult to understand. I’m not against refactoring; it’s a very important and positive thing for a project, but do it separately &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; the bug is fixed and merged.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;No refactoring while fixing a bug!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Create a new unit test, reproduce the bug, and commit it. Fix the bug in the existing code base, no matter how ugly it is. Create new bugs, asking the team to improve the situation with the ugly code base. If interested, assign those bugs to yourself. Or maybe somebody else will be interested in fixing them and refactoring the code. But all that will happen later in other pull requests with new &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/02/09/serious-code-reviewer.html&quot;&gt;code reviews&lt;/a&gt; and new merges.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s not about being &lt;a href=&quot;/2018/04/17/how-to-be-lazy.html&quot;&gt;lazy&lt;/a&gt; and unwilling to fix what looks bad. It’s about a discipline, which is &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/01/15/how-to-cut-corners.html&quot;&gt;much more important&lt;/a&gt; than good intentions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;it-solves-more-than-one-issue&quot;&gt;It Solves More Than One Issue&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Always fix one issue at a time—simple as that. No exceptions. When a bug fix patch contains code changes that fix multiple issues, it is very difficult to understand which issue is tested, which one is reproduced, and how they relate to each other. Combining several bug fixes into a single pull request is a very bad practice.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;No matter how simple the fix is, keep it separate from others. Review, test, and merge it individually. This will also increase the traceability of changes. It will always be easy to understand who made that fix, who reviewed the code, and when it was merged (and deployed).&lt;/p&gt; " /> <meta name="keywords" content="next, path, output, content, previous, url, relative_path, id, collection, excerpt, draft, categories, layout, title, date, tags, description, keywords, image, jb_picture, slug, ext" /> <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1"/> <meta name="google-site-verification" content="JEj_gQr2CPe2QKGw8XdMz0R7VboQIUbX3FlM-lwTq-8" /> <meta name="author" content="Yegor Bugayenko"> <meta name="article:published_time" content="2015-06-22 00:00:00 +0000"> <meta name="og:site_name" content="Yegor Bugayenko"/> <meta name="og:type" content="article" /> <meta name="og:locale" content="en_US" /> <meta name="twitter:account_id" content="4503599630178231" /> <meta name="twitter:creator" content="@yegor256"/> <meta name="twitter:site" content="@yegor256"/> <meta name="twitter:title" property="og:title" content="A Few Valid Reasons to Reject a Bug Fix"/> <meta name="twitter:description" property="og:description" content="&lt;p&gt;A bug exists when something doesn’t work as expected.

doesn’t work as expected. A <em>bug fix</em> is basically a patch (a pull request) to the existing code base that is supposed to solve the problem and make sure that “something” works as expected. Very often, such a patch fixes one thing and breaks many others. I believe that sometimes it’s necessary to <em>reject</em> a bug fix and ask its author to re-do the patch in order to protect the project from bigger problems.

Sounds logical, doesn’t it? However, there is a lot of criticism of this way of thinking. Take this one, for example: Bugs are inevitable, and instead of expecting fewer bugs from us, let us focus on the right design and let testers find and report bugs; then we’ll fix them. Or this one: Being afraid to make a mistake makes me write slower and experiment less, which translates into lower-quality software.

However, if we think more about how the software is actually used and by whom, we’ll see that there are many other types of bugs, including scalability, reliability, and even maintainability ones.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If we put all those “-ilities” in a list and prioritize them by their severity and importance to the business, we’ll see that functionality-related bugs are rather far from the top. I would actually put &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/10/26/hacker-vs-programmer-mentality.html&quot;&gt;maintainability&lt;/a&gt; at the top.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;My point is that mistakes are not all equal. If I’m writing a PDF report generated by a piece of Java code and my report misses the footer, that’s one type of bug, and its fix will cost the business X dollars. On the other hand, if my PDF generation code is so difficult to modify that in order to change its format from &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper_size&quot;&gt;A4&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_%28paper_size%29&quot;&gt;US Letter&lt;/a&gt; we have to rewrite it from scratch, that’s a completely different type of bug. Needless to say, its fixing will be many times more expensive.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Good programmers make cheaper mistakes in order to avoid making more expensive ones.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;So yes, mistakes are inevitable. We should not be afraid of them and be ready to make them. However, good programmers make &lt;em&gt;cheaper&lt;/em&gt; mistakes in order to avoid making more expensive ones.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Good programmers understand that in the limited amount of time we usually have to implement the software, we have to sacrifice functionality in order to gain maintainability. Ideally, you want to achieve both, but in reality, it’s next to impossible.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We all work under pressure, and we have time and money constraints. Within these constraints, good programmers prefer to make functionality buggy and incomplete while keeping the design clean and easy to maintain. There are exceptions, of course, where the business prioritizes functionality above everything else, but such situations happen very rarely (if the business is smart).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To summarize, I think that a good programmer makes more functional bugs than a bad programmer, though the bugs made by a bad programmer are more expensive than bugs made by a good programmer.&lt;/p&gt; " /> <meta name="keywords" content="next, path, output, content, previous, url, relative_path, id, collection, excerpt, draft, categories, layout, title, date, tags, description, keywords, social, image, jb_picture, slug, ext" /> <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1"/> <meta name="google-site-verification" content="JEj_gQr2CPe2QKGw8XdMz0R7VboQIUbX3FlM-lwTq-8" /> <meta name="author" content="Yegor Bugayenko"> <meta name="article:published_time" content="2015-06-18 00:00:00 +0000"> <meta name="og:site_name" content="Yegor Bugayenko"/> <meta name="og:type" content="article" /> <meta name="og:locale" content="en_US" /> <meta name="twitter:account_id" content="4503599630178231" /> <meta name="twitter:creator" content="@yegor256"/> <meta name="twitter:site" content="@yegor256"/> <meta name="twitter:title" property="og:title" content="Good Programmers Write Bug-Free Code, Don't They?"/> <meta name="twitter:description" property="og:description" content="&lt;p&gt;Good programmers create fewer &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/06/11/wikipedia-bug-definition.html&quot;&gt;bugs&lt;/a&gt; while bad programmers cause more.

The longer the time, the lower the maintainability. In some projects, this time requirement is close to infinity, which means it is literally unmaintainable. I believe there are seven fundamental and fatal &lt;strong&gt;sins&lt;/strong&gt; that make our software unmaintainable. Here they are.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;!--more--&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;anti-patterns&quot;&gt;Anti-Patterns&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;badge&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.yegor256.com/images/2015/06/software-project-sins-1.gif&quot; style=&quot;width:250px;max-width:100%;&quot; alt=&quot;badge&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the programming languages we’re using are too &lt;em&gt;flexible&lt;/em&gt;. They allow too much and forbid too little. For example, Java has nothing against you placing the entire application in one single “class” with a few thousand methods. Technically, the application will compile and run. But it’s a well-known anti-pattern called a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_object&quot;&gt;God object&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;youtube&quot;&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtWmlKi3ivc&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;box&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZtWmlKi3ivc/mqdefault.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;YouTube video #ZtWmlKi3ivc&quot; /&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;play&quot;&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;icon icon-play&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;div&gt;Seven Sins of a Software Project; 16 April 2016.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thus, an &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-pattern&quot;&gt;anti-pattern&lt;/a&gt; is a technically acceptable way of designing things that is commonly agreed to be wrong. There are many anti-patterns in each language. Their presence in your product is similar to a tumor in a living organism. Once it starts to grow, it’s very difficult to stop. Eventually, the entire body dies. Eventually, the entire software becomes unmaintainable and has to be re-written.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Once you let a few anti-patterns in, you will eventually get more of them, and the “tumor” will only grow.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is especially true for object-oriented languages (Java, C++, Ruby, and Python), mostly because they inherit so much from procedural languages (C, Fortran, and COBOL). And because &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/08/15/what-is-wrong-object-oriented-programming.html&quot;&gt;OOP&lt;/a&gt; developers tend to think in a procedural and imperative way. Unfortunately.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;By the way, in addition to an existing &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-pattern&quot;&gt;list of well-known anti-patterns&lt;/a&gt;, I also consider &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/09/10/anti-patterns-in-oop.html&quot;&gt;these few things&lt;/a&gt; as rather bad coding approaches.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;My only practical suggestion here is to read and learn. Maybe &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/04/22/favorite-software-books.html&quot;&gt;these books&lt;/a&gt; will help you or my book “&lt;a href=&quot;/elegant-objects.html&quot;&gt;Elegant Objects&lt;/a&gt;.” Always try to be skeptical about the quality of your software, and don’t relax when it “just works.” Like with cancer, the earlier you diagnose it, greater is the chance to survive.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;untraceable-changes&quot;&gt;Untraceable Changes&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;badge&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.yegor256.com/images/2015/06/software-project-sins-2.gif&quot; style=&quot;width:250px;max-width:100%;&quot; alt=&quot;badge&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;When I look at the commit history, I should be able to tell for every single change &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; was changed, &lt;em&gt;who&lt;/em&gt; made a change, and &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; the change was made. Moreover, the time required to get those three answers must be measured in seconds. In most projects, this is not the case. Here are a few practical recommendations:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Always Use Tickets&lt;/strong&gt;. No matter how small the project or its team is, even if it’s just yourself, create tickets (GitHub issues) for every problem you’re solving. Explain the problem briefly in the ticket and document your thinking there. Use the ticket as temporary storage for all information related to the problem. Post everything that could make any sense in the future, when someone else will try to understand what those “few strange commits” were about.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reference Tickets in Commits&lt;/strong&gt;. Needless to say, every commit must have a message. Commits without messages are a very dirty practice; I won’t even discuss why. But just a message is not enough. Every message must start with the number of the ticket you’re working with. GitHub (I’m sure you are using it) will automatically link commits and tickets, increasing &lt;em&gt;traceability&lt;/em&gt; of changes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t Delete Anything&lt;/strong&gt;. Git allows us to do a “forced” push, which overwrites the entire branch that previously existed on the server. This is just one example of how you can destroy the history of development. Many times I’ve also seen people delete their comments in GitHub discussions to make tickets look more “clean.” That’s just wrong. Never delete anything; let your history stay with you, no matter how bad (or messy) it may look to you now.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;ad-hoc-releases&quot;&gt;Ad Hoc Releases&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;badge&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.yegor256.com/images/2015/06/software-project-sins-3.gif&quot; style=&quot;width:250px;max-width:100%;&quot; alt=&quot;badge&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Every piece of software must be packaged before it can be delivered to the end user. If it’s a Java library, it has to be packaged as a &lt;code&gt;.jar&lt;/code&gt; file and released to some repository; if it’s a web app, it has to be deployed to some platform, etc. No matter how small or big the product is, there is always a standard procedure that tests, packages, and deploys.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;An ideal solution would be to automate this procedure so it is possible to execute it from a command line with a single command:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;$ ./release.sh ... DONE &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;took &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;98&lt;/span&gt;.7s&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Most projects are far from that. Their release process always involves some magic, where the person responsible for it (also known as a DevOp) has to click some buttons here and there, login somewhere, check some metrics, etc. Such an &lt;em&gt;ad hoc&lt;/em&gt; release process is still a very typical sin of the entire software engineering industry.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I can give only one practical piece of advice here: Automate it. I use &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/09/11/deployment-script-vs-rultor.html&quot;&gt;rultor.com&lt;/a&gt; for that, but you can use whatever tools you like. What is important is that the entire procedure is fully automated and can be executed from the command line.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;volunteer-static-analysis&quot;&gt;Volunteer Static Analysis&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;badge&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.yegor256.com/images/2015/06/software-project-sins-4.gif&quot; style=&quot;width:250px;max-width:100%;&quot; alt=&quot;badge&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_program_analysis&quot;&gt;Static analysis&lt;/a&gt; is what makes our code &lt;em&gt;look&lt;/em&gt; better. And by making it look better, we are inevitably making it &lt;em&gt;work&lt;/em&gt; better. But this happens only when the entire team is forced (!) to follow the rules dictated by the static analyzer(s). I’ve written about this in &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/08/13/strict-code-quality-control.html&quot;&gt;Strict Control of Java Code Quality&lt;/a&gt;. I use &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.qulice.com&quot;&gt;qulice.com&lt;/a&gt; in Java projects and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop&quot;&gt;rubocop&lt;/a&gt; in Ruby, but there are many similar tools for nearly every language.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;youtube&quot;&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkXLOxZ6Fs4&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;box&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hkXLOxZ6Fs4/mqdefault.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;YouTube video #hkXLOxZ6Fs4&quot; /&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;play&quot;&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;icon icon-play&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;div&gt;Seven Sins of a Software Project; 16 November 2016.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;You can use any of them, but make it mandatory! In most projects where static analysis is used, developers just build nicely-looking reports and continue to write code the way they did before. Such a “volunteer” approach is not doing any favors for the project. Moreover, it creates an illusion of quality.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What I’m saying is that static analysis must be a mandatory step in your deployment pipeline. The build can’t pass if any static analysis rule is violated.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;unknown-test-coverage&quot;&gt;Unknown Test Coverage&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;badge&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.yegor256.com/images/2015/06/software-project-sins-5.gif&quot; style=&quot;width:250px;max-width:100%;&quot; alt=&quot;badge&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Simply put, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_coverage&quot;&gt;test coverage&lt;/a&gt; is the degree to which the software has been &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/07/16/fools-dont-write-unit-tests.html&quot;&gt;tested&lt;/a&gt; by unit or integration tests. The higher the coverage, the greater “amount” of code was executed while tests were running. Obviously, higher coverage is a good thing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, many project developers simply don’t know their coverage. They just don’t measure this metric. They may have some tests, but nobody knows how deeply they penetrate the software and what parts of it are not tested at all. This situation is much worse than low test coverage that is measured and reported to everyone.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;High coverage is not a guarantee of high quality. That’s obvious. But unknown coverage is a clear indicator of maintainability problems. When a new developer enters the project, he or she should be able to make some changes and see how coverage is affected by them. Ideally, test coverage should be checked the same way as static analysis, and the build should fail if it comes out lower than a certain pre-defined threshold (usually somewhere around 80 percent).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;nonstop-development&quot;&gt;Nonstop Development&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;badge&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.yegor256.com/images/2015/06/software-project-sins-6.gif&quot; style=&quot;width:250px;max-width:100%;&quot; alt=&quot;badge&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;What I mean by nonstop is without milestones and releases. No matter what kind of software you’re writing, you must release and &lt;a href=&quot;http://semver.org/&quot;&gt;versionalize&lt;/a&gt; it frequently. A project without a clear release history is an unmaintainable mess.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is mostly because maintainability is all about me being able to understand you by reading your code.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When I look into the source code and its commit and release history, I have to be able to tell what the intention of its author(s) was, what the project was doing a year ago, where it is going now, what its roadmap is, etc. All this information must be in the source code and, more importantly, in Git history.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Tagging&quot;&gt;Git tags&lt;/a&gt; and GitHub &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/blog/1547-release-your-software&quot;&gt;release notes&lt;/a&gt; are two powerful instruments that provide me such information. Use them to their full extent. Also, don’t forget that each binary version of the product must be available for immediate download. I have to be able to download version 0.1.3 and test it right now, even if the project is working on 3.4 at the moment.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;undocumented-interfaces&quot;&gt;Undocumented Interfaces&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;badge&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.yegor256.com/images/2015/06/software-project-sins-7.gif&quot; style=&quot;width:250px;max-width:100%;&quot; alt=&quot;badge&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Every piece of software has interfaces through which it is supposed to be used. If it’s a Ruby gem, there are classes and methods that I’m going to use as an end user of it. If it’s a web app, there are web pages that an end user will see and control in order to use the app. Every software project has interfaces, and they must be carefully documented.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Like everything above, this is also about maintainability. As a new programmer on a project, I will start to learn about it from its interfaces. I should be able to understand what it does and try to use it myself.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I’m talking here about documentation for users, not for developers. In general, I’m against documentation inside the software. Here I totally agree with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://agilemanifesto.org/&quot;&gt;Agile Manifesto&lt;/a&gt;—working software is much more important than comprehensive documentation. But that’s not referring to “external” documentation, which is supposed to be read by users, not developers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So end-user interaction with the software must be clearly documented.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If your software is a library, then its end users are software developers who are going to use it—not contribute to it but simply use it as a “black box.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;hr /&gt; &lt;p&gt;These are the criteria being used to evaluate the open source projects entered in our &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/04/16/award.html&quot;&gt;award&lt;/a&gt; competition.&lt;/p&gt; " /> <meta name="keywords" content="next, path, output, content, previous, url, relative_path, id, collection, excerpt, draft, categories, layout, title, date, tags, description, keywords, translated, social, slug, ext" /> <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1"/> <meta name="google-site-verification" content="JEj_gQr2CPe2QKGw8XdMz0R7VboQIUbX3FlM-lwTq-8" /> <meta name="author" content="Yegor Bugayenko"> <meta name="article:published_time" content="2015-06-08 00:00:00 +0000"> <meta name="og:site_name" content="Yegor Bugayenko"/> <meta name="og:type" content="article" /> <meta name="og:locale" content="en_US" /> <meta name="twitter:account_id" content="4503599630178231" /> <meta name="twitter:creator" content="@yegor256"/> <meta name="twitter:site" content="@yegor256"/> <meta name="twitter:title" property="og:title" content="Seven Deadly Sins of a Software Project"/> <meta name="twitter:description" property="og:description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Maintainability&lt;/em&gt; is the &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/10/26/hacker-vs-programmer-mentality.html&quot;&gt;most valuable virtue&lt;/a&gt; of modern software development. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maintainability&quot;&gt;Maintainability&lt;/a&gt; can basically be measured as the working time required for a new developer to learn the software before he or she can start making serious changes in it.

Git allows us to do a “forced” push, which overwrites the entire branch that previously existed on the server. This is just one example of how you can destroy the history of development. Many times I’ve also seen people delete their comments in GitHub discussions to make tickets look more “clean.” That’s just wrong. Never delete anything; let your history stay with you, no matter how bad (or messy) it may look to you now.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;ad-hoc-releases&quot;&gt;Ad Hoc Releases&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;badge&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.yegor256.com/images/2015/06/software-project-sins-3.gif&quot; style=&quot;width:250px;max-width:100%;&quot; alt=&quot;badge&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Every piece of software must be packaged before it can be delivered to the end user. If it’s a Java library, it has to be packaged as a &lt;code&gt;.jar&lt;/code&gt; file and released to some repository; if it’s a web app, it has to be deployed to some platform, etc. No matter how small or big the product is, there is always a standard procedure that tests, packages, and deploys.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;An ideal solution would be to automate this procedure so it is possible to execute it from a command line with a single command:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;$ ./release.sh ...

Their release process always involves some magic, where the person responsible for it (also known as a DevOp) has to click some buttons here and there, login somewhere, check some metrics, etc. Such an &lt;em&gt;ad hoc&lt;/em&gt; release process is still a very typical sin of the entire software engineering industry.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I can give only one practical piece of advice here: Automate it. I use &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/09/11/deployment-script-vs-rultor.html&quot;&gt;rultor.com&lt;/a&gt; for that, but you can use whatever tools you like. What is important is that the entire procedure is fully automated and can be executed from the command line.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;volunteer-static-analysis&quot;&gt;Volunteer Static Analysis&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;badge&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.yegor256.com/images/2015/06/software-project-sins-4.gif&quot; style=&quot;width:250px;max-width:100%;&quot; alt=&quot;badge&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_program_analysis&quot;&gt;Static analysis&lt;/a&gt; is what makes our code &lt;em&gt;look&lt;/em&gt; better. And by making it look better, we are inevitably making it &lt;em&gt;work&lt;/em&gt; better. But this happens only when the entire team is forced (!) to follow the rules dictated by the static analyzer(s). I’ve written about this in &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/08/13/strict-code-quality-control.html&quot;&gt;Strict Control of Java Code Quality&lt;/a&gt;. I use &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.qulice.com&quot;&gt;qulice.com&lt;/a&gt; in Java projects and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop&quot;&gt;rubocop&lt;/a&gt; in Ruby, but there are many similar tools for nearly every language.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;youtube&quot;&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkXLOxZ6Fs4&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;box&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hkXLOxZ6Fs4/mqdefault.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;YouTube video #hkXLOxZ6Fs4&quot; /&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;play&quot;&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;icon icon-play&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;div&gt;Seven Sins of a Software Project; 16 November 2016.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;You can use any of them, but make it mandatory! In most projects where static analysis is used, developers just build nicely-looking reports and continue to write code the way they did before. Such a “volunteer” approach is not doing any favors for the project. Moreover, it creates an illusion of quality.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What I’m saying is that static analysis must be a mandatory step in your deployment pipeline. The build can’t pass if any static analysis rule is violated.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;unknown-test-coverage&quot;&gt;Unknown Test Coverage&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;badge&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.yegor256.com/images/2015/06/software-project-sins-5.gif&quot; style=&quot;width:250px;max-width:100%;&quot; alt=&quot;badge&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Simply put, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_coverage&quot;&gt;test coverage&lt;/a&gt; is the degree to which the software has been &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/07/16/fools-dont-write-unit-tests.html&quot;&gt;tested&lt;/a&gt; by unit or integration tests. The higher the coverage, the greater “amount” of code was executed while tests were running. Obviously, higher coverage is a good thing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, many project developers simply don’t know their coverage. They just don’t measure this metric. They may have some tests, but nobody knows how deeply they penetrate the software and what parts of it are not tested at all. This situation is much worse than low test coverage that is measured and reported to everyone.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;High coverage is not a guarantee of high quality. That’s obvious. But unknown coverage is a clear indicator of maintainability problems. When a new developer enters the project, he or she should be able to make some changes and see how coverage is affected by them. Ideally, test coverage should be checked the same way as static analysis, and the build should fail if it comes out lower than a certain pre-defined threshold (usually somewhere around 80 percent).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;nonstop-development&quot;&gt;Nonstop Development&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;badge&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.yegor256.com/images/2015/06/software-project-sins-6.gif&quot; style=&quot;width:250px;max-width:100%;&quot; alt=&quot;badge&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;What I mean by nonstop is without milestones and releases. No matter what kind of software you’re writing, you must release and &lt;a href=&quot;http://semver.org/&quot;&gt;versionalize&lt;/a&gt; it frequently. A project without a clear release history is an unmaintainable mess.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is mostly because maintainability is all about me being able to understand you by reading your code.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When I look into the source code and its commit and release history, I have to be able to tell what the intention of its author(s) was, what the project was doing a year ago, where it is going now, what its roadmap is, etc. All this information must be in the source code and, more importantly, in Git history.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Tagging&quot;&gt;Git tags&lt;/a&gt; and GitHub &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/blog/1547-release-your-software&quot;&gt;release notes&lt;/a&gt; are two powerful instruments that provide me such information. Use them to their full extent. Also, don’t forget that each binary version of the product must be available for immediate download. I have to be able to download version 0.1.3 and test it right now, even if the project is working on 3.4 at the moment.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;undocumented-interfaces&quot;&gt;Undocumented Interfaces&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;badge&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.yegor256.com/images/2015/06/software-project-sins-7.gif&quot; style=&quot;width:250px;max-width:100%;&quot; alt=&quot;badge&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Every piece of software has interfaces through which it is supposed to be used. If it’s a Ruby gem, there are classes and methods that I’m going to use as an end user of it. If it’s a web app, there are web pages that an end user will see and control in order to use the app. Every software project has interfaces, and they must be carefully documented.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Like everything above, this is also about maintainability. As a new programmer on a project, I will start to learn about it from its interfaces. I should be able to understand what it does and try to use it myself.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I’m talking here about documentation for users, not for developers. In general, I’m against documentation inside the software. Here I totally agree with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://agilemanifesto.org/&quot;&gt;Agile Manifesto&lt;/a&gt;—working software is much more important than comprehensive documentation. But that’s not referring to “external” documentation, which is supposed to be read by users, not developers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So end-user interaction with the software must be clearly documented.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If your software is a library, then its end users are software developers who are going to use it—not contribute to it but simply use it as a “black box.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;hr /&gt; &lt;p&gt;These are the criteria being used to evaluate the open source projects entered in our &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/04/16/award.html&quot;&gt;award&lt;/a&gt; competition.&lt;/p&gt; "/>

href="/2014/10/26/hacker-vs-programmer-mentality.html">most valuable virtue</a> of modern software development. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maintainability">Maintainability</a> can basically be measured as the working time required for a new developer to learn the software before he or she can start making serious changes in it. The longer the time, the lower the maintainability. In some projects, this time requirement is close to infinity, which means it is literally unmaintainable. I believe there are seven fundamental and fatal <strong>sins</strong> that make our software unmaintainable. Here they are.</p><h2 id="anti-patterns">Anti-Patterns</h2><figure class="badge"><img src="https://www.yegor256.com/images/2015/06/software-project-sins-1.gif" style="width:250px;max-width:100%;" alt="badge" /></figure><p>Unfortunately, the programming languages we’re using are too <em>flexible</em>. They allow too much and forbid too little. For example, Java has nothing against you placing the entire application in one single “class” with a few thousand methods. Technically, the application will compile and run. But it’s a well-known anti-pattern called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_object">God object</a>.</p><aside class="youtube"> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtWmlKi3ivc"><div class="box"> <img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZtWmlKi3ivc/mqdefault.jpg" alt="YouTube video #ZtWmlKi3ivc" /><div class="play"><i class="icon icon-play"></i></div></div></a><div>Seven Sins of a Software Project; 16 April 2016.</div></aside><p>Thus, an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-pattern">anti-pattern</a> is a technically acceptable way of designing things that is commonly agreed to be wrong. There are many anti-patterns in each language. Their presence in your product is similar to a tumor in a living organism. Once it starts to grow, it’s very difficult to stop. Eventually, the entire body dies. Eventually, the entire software becomes unmaintainable and has to be re-written.</p><p>Once you let a few anti-patterns in, you will eventually get more of them, and the “tumor” will only grow.</p><p>This is especially true for object-oriented languages (Java, C++, Ruby, and Python), mostly because they inherit so much from procedural languages (C, Fortran, and COBOL). And because <a href="/2016/08/15/what-is-wrong-object-oriented-programming.html">OOP</a> developers tend to think in a procedural and imperative way. Unfortunately.</p><p>By the way, in addition to an existing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-pattern">list of well-known anti-patterns</a>, I also consider <a href="/2014/09/10/anti-patterns-in-oop.html">these few things</a> as rather bad coding approaches.</p><p>My only practical suggestion here is to read and learn. Maybe <a href="/2015/04/22/favorite-software-books.html">these books</a> will help you or my book “<a href="/elegant-objects.html">Elegant Objects</a>.” Always try to be skeptical about the quality of your software, and don’t relax when it “just works.” Like with cancer, the earlier you diagnose it, greater is the chance to survive.</p><h2 id="untraceable-changes">Untraceable Changes</h2><figure class="badge"><img src="https://www.yegor256.com/images/2015/06/software-project-sins-2.gif" style="width:250px;max-width:100%;" alt="badge" /></figure><p>When I look at the commit history, I should be able to tell for every single change <em>what</em> was changed, <em>who</em> made a change, and <em>why</em> the change was made. Moreover, the time required to get those three answers must be measured in seconds. In most projects, this is not the case. Here are a few practical recommendations:</p><p><strong>Always Use Tickets</strong>. No matter how small the project or its team is, even if it’s just yourself, create tickets (GitHub issues) for every problem you’re solving. Explain the problem briefly in the ticket and document your thinking there. Use the ticket as temporary storage for all information related to the problem. Post everything that could make any sense in the future, when someone else will try to understand what those “few strange commits” were about.</p><p><strong>Reference Tickets in Commits</strong>. Needless to say, every commit must have a message. Commits without messages are a very dirty practice; I won’t even discuss why. But just a message is not enough. Every message must start with the number of the ticket you’re working with. GitHub (I’m sure you are using it) will automatically link commits and tickets, increasing <em>traceability</em> of changes.</p><p><strong>Don’t Delete Anything</strong>. Git allows us to do a “forced” push, which overwrites the entire branch that previously existed on the server. This is just one example of how you can destroy the history of development. Many times I’ve also seen people delete their comments in GitHub discussions to make tickets look more “clean.” That’s just wrong. Never delete anything; let your history stay with you, no matter how bad (or messy) it may look to you now.</p><h2 id="ad-hoc-releases">Ad Hoc Releases</h2><figure class="badge"><img src="https://www.yegor256.com/images/2015/06/software-project-sins-3.gif" style="width:250px;max-width:100%;" alt="badge" /></figure><p>Every piece of software must be packaged before it can be delivered to the end user. If it’s a Java library, it has to be packaged as a <code>.jar</code> file and released to some repository; if it’s a web app, it has to be deployed to some platform, etc. No matter how small or big the product is, there is always a standard procedure that tests, packages, and deploys.</p><p>An ideal solution would be to automate this procedure so it is possible to execute it from a command line with a single command:</p><figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span></span>$ ./release.sh

The longer the time, the lower the maintainability. In some projects, this time requirement is close to infinity, which means it is literally unmaintainable. I believe there are seven fundamental and fatal <strong>sins</strong> that make our software unmaintainable.

They allow too much and forbid too little. For example, Java has nothing against you placing the entire application in one single “class” with a few thousand methods. Technically, the application will compile and run. But it’s a well-known anti-pattern called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_object">God object</a>.</p><aside class="youtube"> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtWmlKi3ivc"><div class="box"> <img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZtWmlKi3ivc/mqdefault.jpg" alt="YouTube video #ZtWmlKi3ivc" /><div class="play"><i class="icon icon-play"></i></div></div></a><div>Seven Sins of a Software Project; 16 April 2016.</div></aside><p>Thus, an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-pattern">anti-pattern</a> is a technically acceptable way of designing things that is commonly agreed to be wrong. There are many anti-patterns in each language. Their presence in your product is similar to a tumor in a living organism. Once it starts to grow, it’s very difficult to stop. Eventually, the entire body dies. Eventually, the entire software becomes unmaintainable and has to be re-written.</p><p>Once you let a few anti-patterns in, you will eventually get more of them, and the “tumor” will only grow.</p><p>This is especially true for object-oriented languages (Java, C++, Ruby, and Python), mostly because they inherit so much from procedural languages (C, Fortran, and COBOL). And because <a href="/2016/08/15/what-is-wrong-object-oriented-programming.html">OOP</a> developers tend to think in a procedural and imperative way. Unfortunately.</p><p>By the way, in addition to an existing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-pattern">list of well-known anti-patterns</a>, I also consider <a href="/2014/09/10/anti-patterns-in-oop.html">these few things</a> as rather bad coding approaches.</p><p>My only practical suggestion here is to read and learn. Maybe <a href="/2015/04/22/favorite-software-books.html">these books</a> will help you or my book “<a href="/elegant-objects.html">Elegant Objects</a>.” Always try to be skeptical about the quality of your software, and don’t relax when it “just works.” Like with cancer, the earlier you diagnose it, greater is the chance to survive.</p><h2 id="untraceable-changes">Untraceable Changes</h2><figure class="badge"><img src="https://www.yegor256.com/images/2015/06/software-project-sins-2.gif" style="width:250px;max-width:100%;" alt="badge" /></figure><p>When I look at the commit history, I should be able to tell for every single change <em>what</em> was changed, <em>who</em> made a change, and <em>why</em> the change was made. Moreover, the time required to get those three answers must be measured in seconds. In most projects, this is not the case. Here are a few practical recommendations:</p><p><strong>Always Use Tickets</strong>. No matter how small the project or its team is, even if it’s just yourself, create tickets (GitHub issues) for every problem you’re solving. Explain the problem briefly in the ticket and document your thinking there. Use the ticket as temporary storage for all information related to the problem. Post everything that could make any sense in the future, when someone else will try to understand what those “few strange commits” were about.</p><p><strong>Reference Tickets in Commits</strong>. Needless to say, every commit must have a message. Commits without messages are a very dirty practice; I won’t even discuss why. But just a message is not enough. Every message must start with the number of the ticket you’re working with. GitHub (I’m sure you are using it) will automatically link commits and tickets, increasing <em>traceability</em> of changes.</p><p><strong>Don’t Delete Anything</strong>. Git allows us to do a “forced” push, which overwrites the entire branch that previously existed on the server. This is just one example of how you can destroy the history of development. Many times I’ve also seen people delete their comments in GitHub discussions to make tickets look more “clean.” That’s just wrong. Never delete anything; let your history stay with you, no matter how bad (or messy) it may look to you now.</p><h2 id="ad-hoc-releases">Ad Hoc Releases</h2><figure class="badge"><img src="https://www.yegor256.com/images/2015/06/software-project-sins-3.gif" style="width:250px;max-width:100%;" alt="badge" /></figure><p>Every piece of software must be packaged before it can be delivered to the end user. If it’s a Java library, it has to be packaged as a <code>.jar</code> file and released to some repository; if it’s a web app, it has to be deployed to some platform, etc. No matter how small or big the product is, there is always a standard procedure that tests, packages, and deploys.</p><p>An ideal solution would be to automate this procedure so it is possible to execute it from a command line with a single command:</p><figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span></span>$ ./release.sh
...
DONE <span class="o">(</span>took <span class="m">98</span>.7s<span class="o">)</span></code></pre></figure><p>Most projects are far from that. Their release process always involves some magic, where the person responsible for it (also known as a DevOp) has to click some buttons here and there, login somewhere, check some metrics, etc. Such an <em>ad hoc</em> release process is still a very typical sin of the entire software engineering industry.</p><p>I can give only one practical piece of advice here: Automate it. I use <a href="/2014/09/11/deployment-script-vs-rultor.html">rultor.com</a> for that, but you can use whatever tools you like. What is important is that the entire procedure is fully automated and can be executed from the command line.</p><h2 id="volunteer-static-analysis">Volunteer Static Analysis</h2><figure class="badge"><img src="https://www.yegor256.com/images/2015/06/software-project-sins-4.gif" style="width:250px;max-width:100%;" alt="badge" /></figure><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_program_analysis">Static analysis</a> is what makes our code <em>look</em> better.

My best answer is “&lt;em&gt;I don’t know; it depends.&lt;/em&gt;” Sounds like a strange response for someone who claims he knows what he is doing, doesn’t it? “Here is the 20-page &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/11/10/ten-mistakes-in-specs.html&quot;&gt;specification&lt;/a&gt; that explains all the features of the product; how come you can’t estimate the cost?” I can, but I won’t. Here is why.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;!--more--&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;jb_picture&quot;&gt;&lt;img itemprop=&quot;image&quot; alt=&quot;Interstate 60: Episodes of the Road (2002) by Bob Gale&quot; src=&quot;/images/2015/06/interstate-60.jpg&quot; longdesc=&quot;#e9fa47d8&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption id=&quot;e9fa47d8&quot;&gt;Interstate 60: Episodes of the Road (2002) by Bob Gale&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Let me ask you something else: &lt;em&gt;Why do you need an estimate?&lt;/em&gt; Yes, I mean it—why do you ask me how much it will cost to develop the software for you? I can tell you why.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Because you don’t &lt;a href=&quot;/2017/11/21/trust-pay-lose.html&quot;&gt;trust&lt;/a&gt; me.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Any software, no matter how big or good it is, always needs more and more improvements and bug fixes&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;And obviously you have good reasons for that, simply because we both know that a software product is something that can stay in development forever and never be finished. Look at YouTube, for example. How much do you think it would take to create a website like this, where users are able to upload their videos and then stream them? A few days for a good web developer. Will it stream video? Yes, it will. Will it be ready to compete with YouTube? No, it won’t. Add a few hundred developers to the team, a few years, and a few million dollars, and even then you will be behind YouTube. Simply because it’s a never-ending process. Any software, no matter how big or good it is, always needs more and more improvements and bug fixes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thus, when you ask me how much it will cost to create a system similar to YouTube, according to your specifications, my honest and accurate answer should be: “&lt;em&gt;All of your money, and it won’t be enough.&lt;/em&gt;” Will you sign a contract and &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/10/27/outsourcing-doesnt-work.html&quot;&gt;outsource&lt;/a&gt; the project to me after that answer? No, you won’t. That’s why I have to lie and promise something like “three months and $40,000.” Why would you trust me? If you’re smart enough, you won’t.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;My point is that no matter what I promise you, I will be wrong. Terribly wrong.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What is the solution? What do you do? I totally understand that you do need a number to make your plans and secure the money. You need to choose the right &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/10/27/outsourcing-doesnt-work.html&quot;&gt;software outsourcing&lt;/a&gt; partner, and you need to know what to expect and when, but …&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You’re asking the &lt;em&gt;wrong question&lt;/em&gt;!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This question has only one valid answer, and it’s the answer nobody will ever give you—the development will take forever and will consume all your money. All other answers are simply a lie.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I’m sorry if I’ve delivered bad news to you.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But let’s get back to the original problem: Why are you asking me how much it will take to develop the software if you know it’s a never-ending process and there is basically no limit? Because you want to make sure your $40,000 will be used the right way and will produce the maximum it can produce. To get this assurance from me, you’re asking for an estimate. I’m telling you that your software will be ready for $40K, and you sleep well. Until the moment you realize you’ve been fooled. By your own self.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;The development will take forever and will consume all your money.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;Your concern is perfectly valid. You want to spend no more than $40K, and you want to get a product that will help you achieve your business goals. For example, you want to get into the market and acquire your first few thousand users. In other words, your biggest worry is that your dollars will be turned into the right amount of the right software.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Any software team can consume your $40K, but each team will produce a different &lt;em&gt;amount&lt;/em&gt; of software with different &lt;em&gt;quality&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;My point is that instead of asking how much a software project will cost, you should ask &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/01/19/how-expensive-is-outsourcing.html&quot;&gt;how much software&lt;/a&gt; we can create for each dollar you give us and what quality will it be.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Basically, don’t ask us to estimate how much gas it will take to get to the finish line, because there is no finish line. Instead, ask us how much we charge per gallon and how many gallons we consume per mile.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Different teams use different metrics to measure their results (to be honest, most of them don’t use any). We, at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zerocracy.com&quot;&gt;Zerocracy&lt;/a&gt;, use &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/11/14/hits-of-code.html&quot;&gt;hits of code&lt;/a&gt;, bugs, pull requests, test coverage, and a few other metrics as measurable indicators of &lt;em&gt;quantity and quality&lt;/em&gt;. We know exactly how much software we can produce for each $100 you pay us.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Collect those numbers from other teams and compare them. Also, make sure you can control these numbers during the course of the project. That’s the guarantee you’re looking for. Now you know what you’re buying and how much you’re paying for it. In other words, like I said above, having these numbers in front of you will assure you that your money is producing the maximum &lt;em&gt;amount&lt;/em&gt; of software it can produce, at the highest &lt;em&gt;quality&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The only question left is how you can know you’re buying the &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt; software. In other words, you know how much we charge per gallon and how many gallons we use per mile, but how do you know we’re driving in the right direction and not making too many circles or detours?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There is only one mechanism to guarantee that: regular checkpoints. You should ask us whether we deliver the software in small and regular increments, and whether we allow you to conduct regular &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/12/18/independent-technical-reviews.html&quot;&gt;independent reviews&lt;/a&gt; of our progress. Also, make sure we prioritize our technical goals, use milestones, versionalize releases, publish release notes, etc. Make sure that in the course of our journey, you are able to control the progress and make corrections.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To summarize, this is wrong (because there is no “there”):&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hey driver, how much will it cost to get there?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;And this is right:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hey driver, how much do you charge per mile, and do you have a map?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hope I’ve made my point clear :)&lt;/p&gt; " /> <meta name="keywords" content="next, path, output, content, previous, url, relative_path, id, collection, excerpt, draft, categories, layout, title, date, tags, description, keywords, image, jb_picture, slug, ext" /> <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1"/> <meta name="google-site-verification" content="JEj_gQr2CPe2QKGw8XdMz0R7VboQIUbX3FlM-lwTq-8" /> <meta name="author" content="Yegor Bugayenko"> <meta name="article:published_time" content="2015-06-02 00:00:00 +0000"> <meta name="og:site_name" content="Yegor Bugayenko"/> <meta name="og:type" content="article" /> <meta name="og:locale" content="en_US" /> <meta name="twitter:account_id" content="4503599630178231" /> <meta name="twitter:creator" content="@yegor256"/> <meta name="twitter:site" content="@yegor256"/> <meta name="twitter:title" property="og:title" content="How Much For This Software?"/> <meta name="twitter:description" property="og:description" content="&lt;p&gt;“Here is the specification; how much will it cost to create this software?” I hear this almost every day from &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/01/26/happy-boss-false-objective.html&quot;&gt;clients&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zerocracy.com&quot;&gt;Zerocracy&lt;/a&gt; and prospects that are planning to become our clients and &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/10/27/outsourcing-doesnt-work.html&quot;&gt;outsource&lt;/a&gt; the software development to us. My best answer is “&lt;em&gt;I don’t know; it depends.&lt;/em&gt;” Sounds like a strange response for someone who claims he knows what he is doing, doesn’t it? “Here is the 20-page &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/11/10/ten-mistakes-in-specs.html&quot;&gt;specification&lt;/a&gt; that explains all the features of the product; how come you can’t estimate the cost?” I can, but I won’t. Here is why.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;!--more--&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;jb_picture&quot;&gt;&lt;img itemprop=&quot;image&quot; alt=&quot;Interstate 60: Episodes of the Road (2002) by Bob Gale&quot; src=&quot;/images/2015/06/interstate-60.jpg&quot; longdesc=&quot;#e9fa47d8&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption id=&quot;e9fa47d8&quot;&gt;Interstate 60: Episodes of the Road (2002) by Bob Gale&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Let me ask you something else: &lt;em&gt;Why do you need an estimate?&lt;/em&gt; Yes, I mean it—why do you ask me how much it will cost to develop the software for you? I can tell you why.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Because you don’t &lt;a href=&quot;/2017/11/21/trust-pay-lose.html&quot;&gt;trust&lt;/a&gt; me.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Any software, no matter how big or good it is, always needs more and more improvements and bug fixes&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;And obviously you have good reasons for that, simply because we both know that a software product is something that can stay in development forever and never be finished. Look at YouTube, for example. How much do you think it would take to create a website like this, where users are able to upload their videos and then stream them? A few days for a good web developer. Will it stream video? Yes, it will. Will it be ready to compete with YouTube? No, it won’t. Add a few hundred developers to the team, a few years, and a few million dollars, and even then you will be behind YouTube. Simply because it’s a never-ending process. Any software, no matter how big or good it is, always needs more and more improvements and bug fixes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thus, when you ask me how much it will cost to create a system similar to YouTube, according to your specifications, my honest and accurate answer should be: “&lt;em&gt;All of your money, and it won’t be enough.&lt;/em&gt;” Will you sign a contract and &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/10/27/outsourcing-doesnt-work.html&quot;&gt;outsource&lt;/a&gt; the project to me after that answer? No, you won’t. That’s why I have to lie and promise something like “three months and $40,000.” Why would you trust me? If you’re smart enough, you won’t.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;My point is that no matter what I promise you, I will be wrong. Terribly wrong.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What is the solution? What do you do? I totally understand that you do need a number to make your plans and secure the money. You need to choose the right &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/10/27/outsourcing-doesnt-work.html&quot;&gt;software outsourcing&lt;/a&gt; partner, and you need to know what to expect and when, but …&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You’re asking the &lt;em&gt;wrong question&lt;/em&gt;!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This question has only one valid answer, and it’s the answer nobody will ever give you—the development will take forever and will consume all your money. All other answers are simply a lie.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I’m sorry if I’ve delivered bad news to you.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But let’s get back to the original problem: Why are you asking me how much it will take to develop the software if you know it’s a never-ending process and there is basically no limit? Because you want to make sure your $40,000 will be used the right way and will produce the maximum it can produce. To get this assurance from me, you’re asking for an estimate. I’m telling you that your software will be ready for $40K, and you sleep well. Until the moment you realize you’ve been fooled. By your own self.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;The development will take forever and will consume all your money.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;Your concern is perfectly valid. You want to spend no more than $40K, and you want to get a product that will help you achieve your business goals.

My best answer is “<em>I don’t know; it depends.</em>” Sounds like a strange response for someone who claims he knows what he is doing, doesn’t it? “Here is the 20-page <a href="/2015/11/10/ten-mistakes-in-specs.html">specification</a> that explains all the features of the product; how come you can’t estimate the cost?” I can, but I won’t.

I can tell you why.</p><p>Because you don’t <a href="/2017/11/21/trust-pay-lose.html">trust</a> me.</p><aside class="quote">Any software, no matter how big or good it is, always needs more and more improvements and bug fixes</aside><p>And obviously you have good reasons for that, simply because we both know that a software product is something that can stay in development forever and never be finished. Look at YouTube, for example. How much do you think it would take to create a website like this, where users are able to upload their videos and then stream them? A few days for a good web developer. Will it stream video? Yes, it will. Will it be ready to compete with YouTube? No, it won’t. Add a few hundred developers to the team, a few years, and a few million dollars, and even then you will be behind YouTube. Simply because it’s a never-ending process. Any software, no matter how big or good it is, always needs more and more improvements and bug fixes.</p><p>Thus, when you ask me how much it will cost to create a system similar to YouTube, according to your specifications, my honest and accurate answer should be: “<em>All of your money, and it won’t be enough.</em>” Will you sign a contract and <a href="/2015/10/27/outsourcing-doesnt-work.html">outsource</a> the project to me after that answer? No, you won’t. That’s why I have to lie and promise something like “three months and $40,000.” Why would you trust me? If you’re smart enough, you won’t.</p><p>My point is that no matter what I promise you, I will be wrong. Terribly wrong.</p><p>What is the solution? What do you do? I totally understand that you do need a number to make your plans and secure the money. You need to choose the right <a href="/2015/10/27/outsourcing-doesnt-work.html">software outsourcing</a> partner, and you need to know what to expect and when, but …</p><p>You’re asking the <em>wrong question</em>!</p><p>This question has only one valid answer, and it’s the answer nobody will ever give you—the development will take forever and will consume all your money. All other answers are simply a lie.</p><p>I’m sorry if I’ve delivered bad news to you.</p><p>But let’s get back to the original problem: Why are you asking me how much it will take to develop the software if you know it’s a never-ending process and there is basically no limit? Because you want to make sure your $40,000 will be used the right way and will produce the maximum it can produce. To get this assurance from me, you’re asking for an estimate. I’m telling you that your software will be ready for $40K, and you sleep well. Until the moment you realize you’ve been fooled. By your own self.</p><aside class="quote">The development will take forever and will consume all your money.</aside><p>Your concern is perfectly valid. You want to spend no more than $40K, and you want to get a product that will help you achieve your business goals. For example, you want to get into the market and acquire your first few thousand users. In other words, your biggest worry is that your dollars will be turned into the right amount of the right software.</p><p>Any software team can consume your $40K, but each team will produce a different <em>amount</em> of software with different <em>quality</em>.</p><p>My point is that instead of asking how much a software project will cost, you should ask <a href="/2016/01/19/how-expensive-is-outsourcing.html">how much software</a> we can create for each dollar you give us and what quality will it be.</p><p>Basically, don’t ask us to estimate how much gas it will take to get to the finish line, because there is no finish line. Instead, ask us how much we charge per gallon and how many gallons we consume per mile.</p><p>Different teams use different metrics to measure their results (to be honest, most of them don’t use any). We, at <a href="https://www.zerocracy.com">Zerocracy</a>, use <a href="/2014/11/14/hits-of-code.html">hits of code</a>, bugs, pull requests, test coverage, and a few other metrics as measurable indicators of <em>quantity and quality</em>.

We don’t use meetings, stand-ups, Skype calls, IRC channels, or any other tools where information flies in the air and stays in our heads. Instead, we put everything in writing and talk only when we’re being explicitly asked to and paid to—in tickets.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;bugs&quot;&gt;Bugs&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;With this in mind, a reasonable question may be asked: How can a software architect enforce his or her technical vision for the team if he can’t communicate with the team? Here is our answer: the architect must use &lt;strong&gt;bugs&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Bugs reported by an architect serve as communication channels between him and the team&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;A bug is a ticket that has a reporter, a problem, and a resolver, just like &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/11/24/principles-of-bug-tracking.html&quot;&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt; explains. Say an architect reviews an existing technical solution and finds something that &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/06/22/valid-reasons-to-reject-bug-fix.html&quot;&gt;contradicts&lt;/a&gt; his vision. When such a contradiction is found, it is a good candidate for a bug. Sometimes there is just not enough information in the code yet, and this is also a good candidate for a bug.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thus, bugs reported by an architect serve as &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/08/23/communication-maturity.html&quot;&gt;communication channels&lt;/a&gt; between him and the team. An architect doesn’t explain what needs to be done but asks the team to fix the product in a way he thinks is right. If the ticket resolver, a member of the team, disagrees with that approach, a discussion starts right in the ticket.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;youtube&quot;&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvVQ5NjS_Nk&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;box&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AvVQ5NjS_Nk/mqdefault.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;YouTube video #AvVQ5NjS_Nk&quot; /&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;play&quot;&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;icon icon-play&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;div&gt;Who is a Software Architect? (webinar #13); 13 April 2016.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sometimes an architect has doubts and needs to discuss a few possible solutions with the team or simply collect opinions. Again, we use bugs for that. But these bugs don’t report problems in the source code; instead, they complain about incomplete documentation. For example, say an architect doesn’t know which database to use, MongoDB or Cassandra, and needs more information about their pros and cons. A bug will sound like “our design documentation doesn’t have a detailed comparison of existing NoSQL databases; please fix it.” Whoever is assigned to this ticket will perform the comparison and update the documentation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Bugs are a &lt;em&gt;proactive&lt;/em&gt; tool for an architect. Through reporting bugs, an architect influences the project and “dictates his will.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;reviews&quot;&gt;Reviews&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;In our projects, every ticket is implemented in its own branch. When implementation is done, all tickets pass mandatory code peer review. In other words, developers review each others’ code. An architect is not involved in this process.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Through strict and non-compromising code reviews, an architect enforces his design and architectural principles&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;But when peer review is done, each ticket goes to an architect and he has to give a final “OK” before the code goes to the &lt;code&gt;master&lt;/code&gt; branch through Rultor, our &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/07/24/rultor-automated-merging.html&quot;&gt;merge bot&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is an architect’s opportunity for control. This is where he can prevent his vision from being destroyed. When the code created by a developer violates project design principles or any part of the entire technical idea, the architect says “No” and the branch is rejected.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Reviews are a &lt;em&gt;reactive&lt;/em&gt; instrument for an architect. Through strict and non-compromising code reviews, an architect enforces his design and architectural principles.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;PS. Here is how an architect is supposed to report to the &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/09/22/micromanagement.html&quot;&gt;project manager&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/05/11/software-architect-responsibilities.html&quot;&gt;Three Things I Expect From a Software Architect&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; " /> <meta name="keywords" content="next, path, output, content, previous, url, relative_path, id, collection, excerpt, draft, categories, layout, title, date, tags, description, keywords, image, jb_picture, slug, ext" /> <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1"/> <meta name="google-site-verification" content="JEj_gQr2CPe2QKGw8XdMz0R7VboQIUbX3FlM-lwTq-8" /> <meta name="author" content="Yegor Bugayenko"> <meta name="article:published_time" content="2015-05-13 00:00:00 +0000"> <meta name="og:site_name" content="Yegor Bugayenko"/> <meta name="og:type" content="article" /> <meta name="og:locale" content="en_US" /> <meta name="twitter:account_id" content="4503599630178231" /> <meta name="twitter:creator" content="@yegor256"/> <meta name="twitter:site" content="@yegor256"/> <meta name="twitter:title" property="og:title" content="Two Instruments of a Software Architect"/> <meta name="twitter:description" property="og:description" content="&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/10/12/who-is-software-architect.html&quot;&gt;software architect&lt;/a&gt; is a key person in any software project, no matter how big or small it is.

The architect is personally responsible for the technical quality of the product we’re developing.

Each report includes three mandatory parts: 1) scope status, 2) issues, and 3) risks.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;scope-status&quot;&gt;Scope Status&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;youtube&quot;&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fuEgmibJc4&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;box&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0fuEgmibJc4/mqdefault.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;YouTube video #0fuEgmibJc4&quot; /&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;play&quot;&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;icon icon-play&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;div&gt;Who Is a Software Architect?; 13 April 2015.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;The first and most important type of information I’m looking for is the scope status, which should be presented in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_breakdown_structure&quot;&gt;Product Breakdown Structure&lt;/a&gt; (PBS) format. No matter how complex or how small the product is, a good architect should be able to create a PBS of &lt;em&gt;four to eight items&lt;/em&gt;. For example:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;1.

UI cross-platform testing [none]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;That’s the size of the report I’m expecting to receive from a good architect every few days. The main goal for the architect here is to make sure that nothing is missed. No matter how big the project is, all its technical components must fit into this PBS.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The architect is &lt;em&gt;personally&lt;/em&gt; responsible for not missing the information in the PBS and making it as accurate as possible. If something is missed or the report is delayed, that becomes a good reason to change the architect.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The percentages of progress are also important here. Even though individual tasks are managed with the “0/100 completion principle” in mind, the architect must compile those percentages and make sure that compilation is accurate. Again, a mistake here is unforgivable.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;issues&quot;&gt;Issues&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;youtube&quot;&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNSezrlemsY&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;box&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://i.ytimg.com/vi/PNSezrlemsY/mqdefault.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;YouTube video #PNSezrlemsY&quot; /&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;play&quot;&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;icon icon-play&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;div&gt;Hacker vs Designer Mentality; 13 April 2015.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;The second important part of a regular report from an architect is a list of current issues the development team is facing. An issue is something that has already happened and we’re suffering from it. Here are a few practical examples:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;1. MySQL is too slow for our performance requirements 2. Java 1.6 doesn&amp;#39;t allow us to use library X 3. We don&amp;#39;t have a replacement for a Ruby guy who left us 4. Integration tests are not predictable&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Again, the list must include four to eight items (no more and no less), and the architect should mention the most critical issues there.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;risks&quot;&gt;Risks&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;youtube&quot;&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvVQ5NjS_Nk&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;box&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AvVQ5NjS_Nk/mqdefault.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;YouTube video #AvVQ5NjS_Nk&quot; /&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;play&quot;&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;icon icon-play&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;div&gt;Who is a Software Architect? (webinar #13); 13 April 2016.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now, the risks. A risk is something that hasn’t happened yet but may happen soon, and if it happens, we’ll be in trouble. The architect is responsible for keeping an eye on all potential risks and regularly reporting the most critical ones to the &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/05/24/who-is-project-manager.html&quot;&gt;project manager&lt;/a&gt;. Here is an example of a brief risk report:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;1. Deployment platform may not support Java 8 [3/8] 2. Library X may take more than the two weeks planned [7/3] 3. We may lose a good Ruby developer soon [5/6] 4. Integration tests may not be safe enough [7/2] 5. We may fail to find an open source library [3/8]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;A project manager may require additional information about each risk, but that’s another story. What is most important is to keep the project manager informed about the top of the list. Each risk has two numbers associated with it: &lt;em&gt;probability&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;impact&lt;/em&gt;, from 0 to 9. In the list above, the first risk has a probability of 3 and impact of 8. This means the architect believes that most likely this won’t happen, but if it does happen, we’ll be in big trouble.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Pay attention, as the key word in each risk description is &lt;em&gt;may&lt;/em&gt;. A risk is something that hasn’t happened yet. That’s the biggest difference between a risk and an issue. An issue is a risk that has already occurred.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;PS.

key person in a software project, which I explained in my <a href="/2014/10/12/who-is-software-architect.html">What Does a Software Architect Do?</a> post a few months ago. The architect is personally responsible for the technical quality of the product we’re developing. No matter how good the team is, how complex the technology is, how messy the requirements are, or how chaotic the project sponsor is, we blame the architect and no one else. Of course, we also reward the architect if we succeed.

No matter how complex or how small the product is, a good architect should be able to create a PBS of <em>four to eight items</em>. For example:</p><figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text"><span></span>1. MySQL persistence [done]

The architect is responsible for keeping an eye on all potential risks and regularly reporting the most critical ones to the <a href="/2016/05/24/who-is-project-manager.html">project manager</a>.

5. We may fail to find an open source library [3/8]</code></pre></figure><p>A project manager may require additional information about each risk, but that’s another story. What is most important is to keep the project manager informed about the top of the list. Each risk has two numbers associated with it: <em>probability</em> and <em>impact</em>, from 0 to 9. In the list above, the first risk has a probability of 3 and impact of 8. This means the architect believes that most likely this won’t happen, but if it does happen, we’ll be in big trouble.</p><p>Pay attention, as the key word in each risk description is <em>may</em>. A risk is something that hasn’t happened yet. That’s the biggest difference between a risk and an issue. An issue is a risk that has already occurred.</p><p>PS.

They may implement your idea (or its elements) without you using their own resources. Also, they may disclose it to their friends, and those friends may disclose it even further, until it is eventually implemented by someone you don’t even know. This happens a lot—and everywhere. I’ve been on both sides. Here is my experience and a few recommendations.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;!--more--&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;jb_picture&quot;&gt;&lt;img itemprop=&quot;image&quot; alt=&quot;There Will Be Blood (2007) by Paul Thomas Anderson&quot; src=&quot;/images/2015/05/there-will-be-blood.jpg&quot; longdesc=&quot;#378e1334&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption id=&quot;378e1334&quot;&gt;There Will Be Blood (2007) by Paul Thomas Anderson&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are basically a few levels of protection you can obtain, and they are listed below, from the simplest and least secure to the most expensive and most secure.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Very often, a software team you &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/10/27/outsourcing-doesnt-work.html&quot;&gt;outsource programming&lt;/a&gt; to is located offshore in a developing country where people care about laws much less than in, say, the United States; corruption makes it possible for them to get away with ignoring almost any violation. Let’s not forget this.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We’re not discussing here the risk of losing a product. This also happens very often—your programmers start working for you, you pay them, they show you something, and then things go south. You find yourself in &lt;a href=&quot;/2017/01/03/how-much-you-love-conflicts.html&quot;&gt;conflict&lt;/a&gt; with them, and they don’t deliver you anything; they ask for extra money instead. You end up with nothing or something that is broken and can’t be put on the market. This is yet another risk, which I’ll try to describe in another article soon.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In this article, we’re talking specifically about a situation where your programmers are using your idea to implement something similar on their own. Let’s say you want to create a new search engine that would be smarter and more accurate than Google. You disclose your algorithms to a group of talented programmers and they just implement it on their own. You already gave them a multi-billion-dollar idea; why would they work for you on the payroll if they can create their own startup? This is the question you, as a savvy entrepreneur, must be prepared to answer for yourself.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;By the way, I’m not a lawyer; I’m speaking here from practical experience only.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;non-disclosure-agreement-nda&quot;&gt;Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA)&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The first and easiest step is a so-called NDA. Here is a very simple and useful example of one, from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/sample-confidentiality-agreement-nda-33343.html&quot;&gt;NOLO&lt;/a&gt;. You put the name of your programmers into the document and ask them to sign it. They won’t object, and you get a piece of paper with a signature; what’s next?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If I’m a programmer, the document basically states that whatever you disclose to me, I should keep in secret and never “use for my own benefit, publish, copy, or otherwise disclose to others.” If you then give me your Google-killer idea and I create my own product using its key principles, what will be your next steps?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In a court of law in your country, you will have to prove that: 1) you disclosed your idea to me, 2) I used it to create the product, 3) I didn’t know about this idea beforehand, and 4) I didn’t invent it myself. Until all of these criteria are proven, I’m innocent and &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; product is online, working and attracting customers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Will you be able to prove that you disclosed the idea to me? Probably, if you sent me some documents. If you discussed it with me over the phone, you won’t prove anything.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Will you be able to prove that your exact idea was used in my product? How will it technically be possible if I don’t disclose the source code?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Can you prove that I didn’t know about something similar before meeting you? Or maybe I was thinking about it on my own. Or I read about it somewhere else.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What if I disclose your idea to my friends and they create a product? Will you be able to prove the fact of that disclosure?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are many such questions. My point is that a signed NDA is a very weak protection. It’s more like a lock on the bathroom door—anyone can break it with a kick from their leg, but for those with good manners, it’s a sign that the restroom is occupied.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;non-compete-clause-ncc&quot;&gt;Non-Compete Clause (NCC)&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The next level of protection is an agreement with a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-compete_clause&quot;&gt;Non-Compete Clause&lt;/a&gt;, which explicitly prohibits me from engaging in the business that your idea is about. For example, it may sound like this: “The developer is not allowed to participate in any businesses related to online searching for five years.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Will I sign this agreement? It depends. But if I show any reluctance in signing it, you should think twice about my real intentions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Will this NCC protect you if I disclose your idea to my friends and they implement it? No, it won’t.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Also, I would recommend you put some explicit liability numbers into the agreement. For example, it may sound like “a minimum penalty for a proven breach of the non-compete clause is $50,000.” In my experience, such explicit statements make contracts much more valuable and help prevent them from being violated.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;copyright&quot;&gt;Copyright&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Copyright is where the government starts to protect you, but you have to pay us for it (by “us” I mean all of us, the society). Well, at least in the United States. In the United Kingdom, it’s free, for example.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the U.S., you go to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.copyright.gov&quot;&gt;copyright.gov&lt;/a&gt;, click “register a copyright,” fill in an online form, post the description of your business idea in a plain text file, pay $35, and you’re done. In a few months, you will receive a confirmation that your “record” is registered.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What does it give you? In a court of law, you can claim that this idea came to your mind on that specific date. Everyone who later made something similar &lt;em&gt;probably&lt;/em&gt; stole it from you, including me, your programmer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Will you be able to prove that my product is actually based on your idea and steals it? Maybe.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s not a very strong protection either, but I would recommend you do it together with an NDA and NCC.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;patent&quot;&gt;Patent&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;A patent is the best you can get to protect your idea. A patent is basically a guarantee of safety that you buy from the government. To get that guarantee, you have to do three things: 1) explain what exactly will be protected, 2) prove that it doesn’t belong to someone else, and 3) pay your dues regularly. It’s very similar to what gangsters do when they “protect” you, but here we’re dealing with intellectual property and there is only one “gangster” per country :) The concept is pretty much the same.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;badge&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/2c5oky8&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.yegor256.com/images/2015/04/nolo-patent-it-yourself.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width:96px;max-width:100%;&quot; alt=&quot;badge&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;First, you describe your idea in the format that patents are written. It is not difficult at all, but it would help if you read one of those “how to file a patent” books. I recommend &lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/2c5oky8&quot;&gt;Patent It Yourself: Your Step-by-Step Guide to Filing at the U.S. Patent Office&lt;/a&gt; by David Pressman and Thomas J. Tuytschaevers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Your application will likely amount to about 10 pages and should take a few days of your time if you know your idea well. No need to hire any attorneys; that’s a waste of money.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Then you should do some research to make sure something similar already exists—but not exactly the same. For example, you can find Google patents for searching algorithms and mention them in your patent in the list of references.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Finally, you pay $425 (if you’re a small company) and submit it to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.uspto.gov&quot;&gt;USPTO&lt;/a&gt;. There is also an option to file a “provisional” patent, but I would recommend you not do this, as it’s just an extra hassle. Simply file a normal one.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Once you’ve paid, your protection starts immediately. If I create a product that uses the idea described in your patent, you can bring me to court and ask me to share my profit with you. You will claim that I was making money by using your brilliant idea, and now it’s time to share that success. Legally speaking, you will accuse me of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patent_infringement&quot;&gt;patent infringement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;First, I will try to invalidate your patent, claiming that something similar already existed before you filed a patent, called &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prior_art&quot;&gt;prior art&lt;/a&gt;. If I succeed, the USPTO will invalidate your patent without a refund, and I’ll walk away, paying you nothing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If I fail, I’ll try to prove that I didn’t infringe on your patent. I will say that my product is not using your ideas but rather is designed with something else in mind, just like Samsung &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc._v._Samsung_Electronics_Co.&quot;&gt;did&lt;/a&gt;. Maybe I’ll win, but my chances will be low.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;By the way, in a few years, you will receive a patent from the USPTO and put it on the shelf. You will then have to pay $480 more. Also, at the end of three years, you will have to pay $800 just to keep your guarantee alive. That escalates to $1,800 in seven years and $3,700 in 11 years (see the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.uspto.gov/learning-and-resources/fees-and-payment/uspto-fee-schedule&quot;&gt;fee schedule&lt;/a&gt;). Told you; just like gangsters :)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To summarize, getting a patent is the best instrument available at the moment in developed countries that can protect your business idea. However, as Apple vs. Samsung &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc._v._Samsung_Electronics_Co.&quot;&gt;lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; demonstrates, it is not a 100 percent guarantee either.&lt;/p&gt; " /> <meta name="keywords" content="next, path, output, content, previous, url, relative_path, id, collection, excerpt, draft, categories, layout, title, date, tags, description, keywords, image, jb_picture, slug, ext" /> <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1"/> <meta name="google-site-verification" content="JEj_gQr2CPe2QKGw8XdMz0R7VboQIUbX3FlM-lwTq-8" /> <meta name="author" content="Yegor Bugayenko"> <meta name="article:published_time" content="2015-05-04 00:00:00 +0000"> <meta name="og:site_name" content="Yegor Bugayenko"/> <meta name="og:type" content="article" /> <meta name="og:locale" content="en_US" /> <meta name="twitter:account_id" content="4503599630178231" /> <meta name="twitter:creator" content="@yegor256"/> <meta name="twitter:site" content="@yegor256"/> <meta name="twitter:title" property="og:title" content="How to Protect a Business Idea While Outsourcing"/> <meta name="twitter:description" property="og:description" content="&lt;p&gt;When you hire a programmer or a team of programmers to implement your business idea, there is a significant risk of theft and accidental loss. They may implement your idea (or its elements) without you using their own resources. Also, they may disclose it to their friends, and those friends may disclose it even further, until it is eventually implemented by someone you don’t even know. This happens a lot—and everywhere. I’ve been on both sides. Here is my experience and a few recommendations.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;!--more--&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;jb_picture&quot;&gt;&lt;img itemprop=&quot;image&quot; alt=&quot;There Will Be Blood (2007) by Paul Thomas Anderson&quot; src=&quot;/images/2015/05/there-will-be-blood.jpg&quot; longdesc=&quot;#378e1334&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption id=&quot;378e1334&quot;&gt;There Will Be Blood (2007) by Paul Thomas Anderson&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are basically a few levels of protection you can obtain, and they are listed below, from the simplest and least secure to the most expensive and most secure.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Very often, a software team you &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/10/27/outsourcing-doesnt-work.html&quot;&gt;outsource programming&lt;/a&gt; to is located offshore in a developing country where people care about laws much less than in, say, the United States; corruption makes it possible for them to get away with ignoring almost any violation. Let’s not forget this.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We’re not discussing here the risk of losing a product. This also happens very often—your programmers start working for you, you pay them, they show you something, and then things go south. You find yourself in &lt;a href=&quot;/2017/01/03/how-much-you-love-conflicts.html&quot;&gt;conflict&lt;/a&gt; with them, and they don’t deliver you anything; they ask for extra money instead. You end up with nothing or something that is broken and can’t be put on the market. This is yet another risk, which I’ll try to describe in another article soon.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In this article, we’re talking specifically about a situation where your programmers are using your idea to implement something similar on their own. Let’s say you want to create a new search engine that would be smarter and more accurate than Google. You disclose your algorithms to a group of talented programmers and they just implement it on their own. You already gave them a multi-billion-dollar idea; why would they work for you on the payroll if they can create their own startup? This is the question you, as a savvy entrepreneur, must be prepared to answer for yourself.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;By the way, I’m not a lawyer; I’m speaking here from practical experience only.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;non-disclosure-agreement-nda&quot;&gt;Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA)&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The first and easiest step is a so-called NDA. Here is a very simple and useful example of one, from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/sample-confidentiality-agreement-nda-33343.html&quot;&gt;NOLO&lt;/a&gt;. You put the name of your programmers into the document and ask them to sign it. They won’t object, and you get a piece of paper with a signature; what’s next?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If I’m a programmer, the document basically states that whatever you disclose to me, I should keep in secret and never “use for my own benefit, publish, copy, or otherwise disclose to others.” If you then give me your Google-killer idea and I create my own product using its key principles, what will be your next steps?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In a court of law in your country, you will have to prove that: 1) you disclosed your idea to me, 2) I used it to create the product, 3) I didn’t know about this idea beforehand, and 4) I didn’t invent it myself. Until all of these criteria are proven, I’m innocent and &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; product is online, working and attracting customers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Will you be able to prove that you disclosed the idea to me? Probably, if you sent me some documents. If you discussed it with me over the phone, you won’t prove anything.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Will you be able to prove that your exact idea was used in my product? How will it technically be possible if I don’t disclose the source code?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Can you prove that I didn’t know about something similar before meeting you? Or maybe I was thinking about it on my own. Or I read about it somewhere else.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What if I disclose your idea to my friends and they create a product? Will you be able to prove the fact of that disclosure?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are many such questions. My point is that a signed NDA is a very weak protection. It’s more like a lock on the bathroom door—anyone can break it with a kick from their leg, but for those with good manners, it’s a sign that the restroom is occupied.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;non-compete-clause-ncc&quot;&gt;Non-Compete Clause (NCC)&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The next level of protection is an agreement with a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-compete_clause&quot;&gt;Non-Compete Clause&lt;/a&gt;, which explicitly prohibits me from engaging in the business that your idea is about.

team of programmers to implement your business idea, there is a significant risk of theft and accidental loss. They may implement your idea (or its elements) without you using their own resources. Also, they may disclose it to their friends, and those friends may disclose it even further, until it is eventually implemented by someone you don’t even know. This happens a lot—and everywhere. I’ve been on both sides. Here is my experience and a few recommendations.</p><figure class="jb_picture"><img itemprop="image" alt="There Will Be Blood (2007) by Paul Thomas Anderson" src="/images/2015/05/there-will-be-blood.jpg" longdesc="#378e1334" /><figcaption id="378e1334">There Will Be Blood (2007) by Paul Thomas Anderson</figcaption></figure><p>There are basically a few levels of protection you can obtain, and they are listed below, from the simplest and least secure to the most expensive and most secure.</p><p>Very often, a software team you <a href="/2015/10/27/outsourcing-doesnt-work.html">outsource programming</a> to is located offshore in a developing country where people care about laws much less than in, say, the United States; corruption makes it possible for them to get away with ignoring almost any violation. Let’s not forget this.</p><p>We’re not discussing here the risk of losing a product. This also happens very often—your programmers start working for you, you pay them, they show you something, and then things go south. You find yourself in <a href="/2017/01/03/how-much-you-love-conflicts.html">conflict</a> with them, and they don’t deliver you anything; they ask for extra money instead. You end up with nothing or something that is broken and can’t be put on the market. This is yet another risk, which I’ll try to describe in another article soon.</p><p>In this article, we’re talking specifically about a situation where your programmers are using your idea to implement something similar on their own. Let’s say you want to create a new search engine that would be smarter and more accurate than Google. You disclose your algorithms to a group of talented programmers and they just implement it on their own. You already gave them a multi-billion-dollar idea; why would they work for you on the payroll if they can create their own startup? This is the question you, as a savvy entrepreneur, must be prepared to answer for yourself.</p><p>By the way, I’m not a lawyer; I’m speaking here from practical experience only.</p><h2 id="non-disclosure-agreement-nda">Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA)</h2><p>The first and easiest step is a so-called NDA. Here is a very simple and useful example of one, from <a href="http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/sample-confidentiality-agreement-nda-33343.html">NOLO</a>. You put the name of your programmers into the document and ask them to sign it. They won’t object, and you get a piece of paper with a signature; what’s next?</p><p>If I’m a programmer, the document basically states that whatever you disclose to me, I should keep in secret and never “use for my own benefit, publish, copy, or otherwise disclose to others.” If you then give me your Google-killer idea and I create my own product using its key principles, what will be your next steps?</p><p>In a court of law in your country, you will have to prove that: 1) you disclosed your idea to me, 2) I used it to create the product, 3) I didn’t know about this idea beforehand, and 4) I didn’t invent it myself. Until all of these criteria are proven, I’m innocent and <em>my</em> product is online, working and attracting customers.</p><p>Will you be able to prove that you disclosed the idea to me? Probably, if you sent me some documents. If you discussed it with me over the phone, you won’t prove anything.</p><p>Will you be able to prove that your exact idea was used in my product? How will it technically be possible if I don’t disclose the source code?</p><p>Can you prove that I didn’t know about something similar before meeting you? Or maybe I was thinking about it on my own. Or I read about it somewhere else.</p><p>What if I disclose your idea to my friends and they create a product? Will you be able to prove the fact of that disclosure?</p><p>There are many such questions. My point is that a signed NDA is a very weak protection. It’s more like a lock on the bathroom door—anyone can break it with a kick from their leg, but for those with good manners, it’s a sign that the restroom is occupied.</p><h2 id="non-compete-clause-ncc">Non-Compete Clause (NCC)</h2><p>The next level of protection is an agreement with a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-compete_clause">Non-Compete Clause</a>, which explicitly prohibits me from engaging in the business that your idea is about. For example, it may sound like this: “The developer is not allowed to participate in any businesses related to online searching for five years.”</p><p>Will I sign this agreement? It depends. But if I show any reluctance in signing it, you should think twice about my real intentions.</p><p>Will this NCC protect you if I disclose your idea to my friends and they implement it? No, it won’t.</p><p>Also, I would recommend you put some explicit liability numbers into the agreement. For example, it may sound like “a minimum penalty for a proven breach of the non-compete clause is $50,000.” In my experience, such explicit statements make contracts much more valuable and help prevent them from being violated.</p><h2 id="copyright">Copyright</h2><p>Copyright is where the government starts to protect you, but you have to pay us for it (by “us” I mean all of us, the society). Well, at least in the United States. In the United Kingdom, it’s free, for example.</p><p>In the U.S., you go to <a href="http://www.copyright.gov">copyright.gov</a>, click “register a copyright,” fill in an online form, post the description of your business idea in a plain text file, pay $35, and you’re done. In a few months, you will receive a confirmation that your “record” is registered.</p><p>What does it give you? In a court of law, you can claim that this idea came to your mind on that specific date. Everyone who later made something similar <em>probably</em> stole it from you, including me, your programmer.</p><p>Will you be able to prove that my product is actually based on your idea and steals it? Maybe.</p><p>It’s not a very strong protection either, but I would recommend you do it together with an NDA and NCC.</p><h2 id="patent">Patent</h2><p>A patent is the best you can get to protect your idea. A patent is basically a guarantee of safety that you buy from the government. To get that guarantee, you have to do three things: 1) explain what exactly will be protected, 2) prove that it doesn’t belong to someone else, and 3) pay your dues regularly. It’s very similar to what gangsters do when they “protect” you, but here we’re dealing with intellectual property and there is only one “gangster” per country :) The concept is pretty much the same.</p><figure class="badge"><a href="http://amzn.to/2c5oky8"><img src="https://www.yegor256.com/images/2015/04/nolo-patent-it-yourself.jpg" style="width:96px;max-width:100%;" alt="badge" /></a></figure><p>First, you describe your idea in the format that patents are written. It is not difficult at all, but it would help if you read one of those “how to file a patent” books. I recommend <a href="http://amzn.to/2c5oky8">Patent It Yourself: Your Step-by-Step Guide to Filing at the U.S. Patent Office</a> by David Pressman and Thomas J. Tuytschaevers.</p><p>Your application will likely amount to about 10 pages and should take a few days of your time if you know your idea well. No need to hire any attorneys; that’s a waste of money.</p><p>Then you should do some research to make sure something similar already exists—but not exactly the same. For example, you can find Google patents for searching algorithms and mention them in your patent in the list of references.</p><p>Finally, you pay $425 (if you’re a small company) and submit it to the <a href="http://www.uspto.gov">USPTO</a>. There is also an option to file a “provisional” patent, but I would recommend you not do this, as it’s just an extra hassle. Simply file a normal one.</p><p>Once you’ve paid, your protection starts immediately. If I create a product that uses the idea described in your patent, you can bring me to court and ask me to share my profit with you. You will claim that I was making money by using your brilliant idea, and now it’s time to share that success. Legally speaking, you will accuse me of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patent_infringement">patent infringement</a>.</p><p>First, I will try to invalidate your patent, claiming that something similar already existed before you filed a patent, called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prior_art">prior art</a>. If I succeed, the USPTO will invalidate your patent without a refund, and I’ll walk away, paying you nothing.</p><p>If I fail, I’ll try to prove that I didn’t infringe on your patent. I will say that my product is not using your ideas but rather is designed with something else in mind, just like Samsung <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc._v._Samsung_Electronics_Co.">did</a>. Maybe I’ll win, but my chances will be low.</p><p>By the way, in a few years, you will receive a patent from the USPTO and put it on the shelf. You will then have to pay $480 more. Also, at the end of three years, you will have to pay $800 just to keep your guarantee alive. That escalates to $1,800 in seven years and $3,700 in 11 years (see the <a href="http://www.uspto.gov/learning-and-resources/fees-and-payment/uspto-fee-schedule">fee schedule</a>). Told you; just like gangsters :)</p><p>To summarize, getting a patent is the best instrument available at the moment in developed countries that can protect your business idea. However, as Apple vs. Samsung <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc._v._Samsung_Electronics_Co.">lawsuit</a> demonstrates, it is not a 100 percent guarantee either.</p></p><nav class="buttons notranslate desktop-only"> <a href="http://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://www.yegor256.com/2015/05/04/how-to-protect-business-idea.html" title="Share on Facebook" class="button" rel="nofollow"> <span class="count count-facebook">0</span> <i class="icon icon-facebook notranslate" aria-hidden="true"></i> </a> <a href="https://twitter.com/share?url=https://www.yegor256.com/2015/05/04/how-to-protect-business-idea.html&amp;text=How+to+Protect+a+Business+Idea+While+Outsourcing" title="Share on Twitter" class="button" rel="nofollow"> <span class="count count-twitter">0</span> <i class="icon icon-twitter notranslate" aria-hidden="true"></i> </a> <a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=https://www.yegor256.com/2015/05/04/how-to-protect-business-idea.html" title="Share on Google+" class="button" rel="nofollow"> <span class="count count-googleplus">0</span> <i class="icon icon-googleplus notranslate" aria-hidden="true"></i> </a> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/cws/share?url=https://www.yegor256.com/2015/05/04/how-to-protect-business-idea.html" title="Share on LinkedIn" class="button" rel="nofollow"> <span class="count count-linkedin">0</span> <i class="icon icon-linkedin notranslate" aria-hidden="true"></i> </a> <a href="http://reddit.com/submit?url=https://www.yegor256.com/2015/05/04/how-to-protect-business-idea.html%3F2015-18&amp;title=How+to+Protect+a+Business+Idea+While+Outsourcing" title="Share on Reddit" class="button" rel="nofollow"> <span class="count count-reddit">0</span> <i class="icon icon-reddit notranslate" aria-hidden="true"></i> </a> <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/submitlink?u=https://www.yegor256.com/2015/05/04/how-to-protect-business-idea.html%3F2015-18&amp;t=How+to+Protect+a+Business+Idea+While+Outsourcing" title="Share on Hacker News" class="button" rel="nofollow"> <span class="count count-hackernews">0</span> <i class="icon icon-hackernews notranslate" aria-hidden="true"></i> </a> </nav> </header> <article class="main" itemprop="articleBody"><div ><p>When you hire a programmer or a team of programmers to implement your business idea, there is a significant risk of theft and accidental loss.

Anyway, I will try.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;A detailed and accurate glossary saves a reader a lot of time&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;A glossary (a.k.a. vocabulary) is a list of terms used by the project that is usually included at the beginning of the technical specification document. Ideally, every technical term used in the document should be briefly explained in the glossary. The existence of a glossary helps everyone who works with the document quickly understand each other and avoid misconceptions. On top of this, a detailed and accurate glossary saves a reader a lot of time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So why are glossaries not written? I see a few possible causes (usually, they are combined):&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We’re Smarter Than This&lt;/strong&gt;. Some people think glossaries are for newbies. After all, why would I explain what a PDU is? Any serious network engineer should understand that it stands for “protocol data unit.” If you don’t understand it, do your homework and then come back to work with us. Our team only works with well-educated engineers. You’re supposed to understand what PDU, ADC, TxR, IPv6, DPI, FIFO, and USSR (joking!) stand for. Otherwise, you’re not talented enough to be with us. Needless to say, this attitude can only come from those who have no idea what they are doing. A good engineer always remembers that if the receiver doesn’t understand a message, it’s the sender’s fault.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We Don’t Need These Formalities&lt;/strong&gt;. Seriously, why would we spend time on writing a glossary if everybody understands all our terms without it? We’ve been working as a team for a few years, so we all know what DPI and FIFO are, and we know what “record” and “timing data” are. Why bother with the glossary, which will provide no additional business value for us? I’ve seen many technical meetings of very mature and “well-organized” teams burn hours of time on pointless discussions simply because of different understandings the same term. A glossary is not a formality; it’s a key instrument of a software architect and all other team members.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;A good engineer always remembers that if the receiver doesn't understand a message, it's the sender's fault&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We Prefer Working Software Over Comprehensive Documentation&lt;/strong&gt;. This is what the &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/07/11/mistakes-in-agile-manifesto.html&quot;&gt;Agile Manifesto&lt;/a&gt; says, and it’s true. But the key word here is “comprehensive.” We don’t need comprehensive documentation, but we need a glossary. It’s a key element in any project, and it simply can’t be replaced by working software. No working software can help us understand what “header” and “data signal” are unless there is a simple and clear statement about it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We Don’t Have Time&lt;/strong&gt;. We’re developing too fast and brainstorming every day, so the concept is frequently changing. We simply don’t have time to document our thoughts. We all understand each other, and that is the beauty of being agile. No, that is not a beauty. Instead, it is a lack of discipline and elementary management skill. A lack of a glossary is a personal fault of the software architect, and there are no excuses for it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All Our Terms Are Well-Known to Everyone&lt;/strong&gt;. Seriously, do we need to document what TCP/IP and FIFO are? That’s what they teach us in school. Everyone understands that, don’t they? Yes, some of the terms are well-known.

I’m not sure what the causes are, but this is what a software architect should do when he or she starts a project—create a glossary.</p><figure class="jb_picture"><img itemprop="image" alt="Pulp Fiction (1994) by Quentin Tarantino" src="/images/2015/03/pulp-fiction.jpg" longdesc="#f3384ab3" /><figcaption id="f3384ab3">Pulp Fiction (1994) by Quentin Tarantino</figcaption></figure><p>I’m trying to write something unique about this subject, but everything I can say is so obvious that I doubt anyone would be interested in reading it. Anyway, I will try.</p><aside class="quote">A detailed and accurate glossary saves a reader a lot of time</aside><p>A glossary (a.k.a. vocabulary) is a list of terms used by the project that is usually included at the beginning of the technical specification document. Ideally, every technical term used in the document should be briefly explained in the glossary. The existence of a glossary helps everyone who works with the document quickly understand each other and avoid misconceptions. On top of this, a detailed and accurate glossary saves a reader a lot of time.</p><p>So why are glossaries not written? I see a few possible causes (usually, they are combined):</p><p><strong>We’re Smarter Than This</strong>. Some people think glossaries are for newbies. After all, why would I explain what a PDU is? Any serious network engineer should understand that it stands for “protocol data unit.” If you don’t understand it, do your homework and then come back to work with us. Our team only works with well-educated engineers. You’re supposed to understand what PDU, ADC, TxR, IPv6, DPI, FIFO, and USSR (joking!) stand for. Otherwise, you’re not talented enough to be with us. Needless to say, this attitude can only come from those who have no idea what they are doing. A good engineer always remembers that if the receiver doesn’t understand a message, it’s the sender’s fault.</p><p><strong>We Don’t Need These Formalities</strong>. Seriously, why would we spend time on writing a glossary if everybody understands all our terms without it? We’ve been working as a team for a few years, so we all know what DPI and FIFO are, and we know what “record” and “timing data” are. Why bother with the glossary, which will provide no additional business value for us? I’ve seen many technical meetings of very mature and “well-organized” teams burn hours of time on pointless discussions simply because of different understandings the same term. A glossary is not a formality; it’s a key instrument of a software architect and all other team members.</p><aside class="quote">A good engineer always remembers that if the receiver doesn't understand a message, it's the sender's fault</aside><p><strong>We Prefer Working Software Over Comprehensive Documentation</strong>. This is what the <a href="/2016/07/11/mistakes-in-agile-manifesto.html">Agile Manifesto</a> says, and it’s true. But the key word here is “comprehensive.” We don’t need comprehensive documentation, but we need a glossary. It’s a key element in any project, and it simply can’t be replaced by working software. No working software can help us understand what “header” and “data signal” are unless there is a simple and clear statement about it.</p><p><strong>We Don’t Have Time</strong>. We’re developing too fast and brainstorming every day, so the concept is frequently changing. We simply don’t have time to document our thoughts. We all understand each other, and that is the beauty of being agile. No, that is not a beauty. Instead, it is a lack of discipline and elementary management skill. A lack of a glossary is a personal fault of the software architect, and there are no excuses for it.</p><p><strong>All Our Terms Are Well-Known to Everyone</strong>. Seriously, do we need to document what TCP/IP and FIFO are? That’s what they teach us in school. Everyone understands that, don’t they? Yes, some of the terms are well-known. But what is the problem of adding them to the glossary with a few words and a link to a Wikipedia article? This will only take a few minutes of an architect’s time, but it will make life easier for everybody in the project, both now and in a few years from now.</p><p>To conclude, there is no excuse for the absence of a glossary in any software project. And it is the personal responsibility of a software architect to keep this document (or a chapter) up to date.</p><p>Hope I wasn’t too obvious above :)</p></div></article></div><div class="wrapper"> <related-posts /></div><div class="disqus" role="complementary"><p class="disqus_hint"> Please, use <a href="https://help.disqus.com/commenting/what-html-tags-are-allowed-within-comments">syntax highlighting</a> in your comments, to make them more readable.</p><div id="disqus_thread" class="disqus-thread"> <a>&nbsp;</a></div><script> var disqus_config = function () { this.page.url = document.location.href.split('?')[0].split('#')[0].replace('https://', 'http://'); this.page.identifier = this.page.url; }; (function() { var d = document, s = d.createElement('script'); s.src = '//yegor256.disqus.com/embed.js'; s.setAttribute('data-timestamp', +new Date()); (d.head || d.body).appendChild(s); })(); </script> <noscript><div><p class="red"> JavaScript is disabled in your browser, that's why you can't see comments under this post.</p></div></noscript></div><div class="wrapper"> <footer class="footer"><p> &copy; <span itemscope="" itemprop="copyrightHolder" itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"> <span itemprop="name">Yegor Bugayenko</span> </span> 2014&ndash;<span itemprop="copyrightYear">2018</span></p></footer></div></section><div class="wrapper unprintable" style="text-align:center;margin-top:2em;"> <a href="http://www.sixnines.io/h/3ba1652f"> <img src="//www.sixnines.io/b/3ba1652f?style=flat" alt="sixnines availability badge"/> </a></div><script src="//code.jquery.com/jquery-1.9.0.min.js"></script> <script src="/js/all.js?c998b88f617"></script> <script>var disqus_shortname = 'yegor256';</script> <script id="dsq-count-scr" src="//yegor256.disqus.com/count.js" async="async"></script> <script> (function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){ (i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o), m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m) })(window,document,'script','//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga'); ga('create', 'UA-1963507-32', 'auto'); ga('send', 'pageview'); </script> <script> Cd=document;Cr="&"+Math.random();Cp="&s=1"; Cd.cookie="b=b";if(Cd.cookie)Cp+="&c=1"; Cp+="&t="+(new Date()).getTimezoneOffset(); if(self!=top)Cp+="&f=1"; </script> <script> if(navigator.javaEnabled())Cp+="&j=1"; </script> <script> if(typeof(screen)!='undefined')Cp+="&w="+screen.width+"&h="+ screen.height+"&d="+(screen.colorDepth?screen.colorDepth:screen.pixelDepth); </script> <script> Cd.write("<img src='//c.hit.ua/hit?i=95870&g=0&x=2"+Cp+Cr+ "&r="+escape(Cd.referrer)+"&u="+escape(window.location.href)+ "' border='0' wi"+"dth='1' he"+"ight='1'/>"); </script> <script type="application/ld+json"> { "@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Person", "name": "Yegor Bugayenko", "url": "https://www.yegor256.com", "sameAs": [ "https://www.facebook.com/yegor256", "https://instagram.com/yegor256", "https://www.linkedin.com/in/yegor256", "https://twitter.com/yegor256", "https://github.com/yegor256", "https://www.pinterest.com/yegor256/" ] } </script> </body> </html> <!DOCTYPE html> <html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/WebSite"> <head> <meta charset="utf-8"/> <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;There are plenty of books, articles, and blog posts about &lt;em&gt;team morale&lt;/em&gt;.

The first and most important quality of a good manager is his or her ability to separate bad apples from good ones as soon as possible. Nothing will earn you more disrespect from your team than tolerance of &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/10/13/competition-without-rules.html&quot;&gt;under-performing&lt;/a&gt; team members. Your job as a manager is to help the best players play better, and they can’t play better if they see that management doesn’t understand the difference between excellence and mediocrity. It’s a severe demotivating factor.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;youtube&quot;&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibT5oKToMoQ&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;box&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ibT5oKToMoQ/mqdefault.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;YouTube video #ibT5oKToMoQ&quot; /&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;play&quot;&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;icon icon-play&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;div&gt;Daily Stand-Up Meetings Are Evil (webinar #11); 3 February 2016.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be Honest About Problems and Risks&lt;/strong&gt;. Your team is following you and expecting you to be a smart manager. While they are writing Java, you’re talking to investors and customers. They want to be sure you know what you’re doing. The best way to show them you have no idea where the team is going is to tell them that the future is bright and cloudless. Everybody understands that’s either a lie and you are trying to hide risks or you’re stupid enough to not see them. In either case, the best people would attempt to quit before it’s too late. Thus, to keep morale up, &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/05/21/avoid-software-outsourcing-disaster.html&quot;&gt;regularly inform&lt;/a&gt; your people about problems you’re facing and risks you’re trying to prevent. They will appreciate it and respect you. A strong, professional manager deals with risks instead of ignoring them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;A strong manager isn't afraid to look stupid in front of the team&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Failures Are Yours; Success Is Theirs&lt;/strong&gt;. Always remember that when someone on your team makes a mistake, it is first of all &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; personal mistake. You hired that person, you trained him or her, you delegated the responsibility, and you controlled and monitored the job. Then he made a mistake, and the project lost money, disappointed a customer, or damaged the firm’s reputation. Of course you need to take necessary disciplinary actions and maybe &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/09/16/how-to-fire-someone-right.html&quot;&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt; the troublemaker. But first of all, you have to admit in front of everyone that it was &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; personal mistake. You didn’t control enough, you didn’t &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/05/24/who-is-project-manager.html&quot;&gt;plan&lt;/a&gt; well, or you didn’t take preventive actions. This is what the team expects from you. Also, your people expect you to explain to them how you’re going to learn from this mistake in order to prevent a similar one from happening in the future. A strong manager isn’t afraid to look stupid in front of the team. A weak manager does look stupid when he or she tries to hide mistakes that have been made.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Responsibility Is Always Personal&lt;/strong&gt;. The most demotivating word used in task descriptions is “together.” Don’t use it. Each task has to be personally and individually assigned (no matter what the &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/07/11/mistakes-in-agile-manifesto.html&quot;&gt;Agile Manifesto&lt;/a&gt; says). Everybody is responsible for his or her own success or failure. How their results join together and lead to a mutual success or failure—that’s &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/05/24/who-is-project-manager.html&quot;&gt;business&lt;/a&gt;. Whether you succeed or fail, we all will see. Once you say we all have to succeed &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/11/21/ringelmann-effect-vs-agile.html&quot;&gt;together&lt;/a&gt;, the team understands that you’re trying to shift responsibility from your own shoulders to theirs. It’s a sign of weakness, and you lose respect. Make tasks and goals strictly personal, and be prepared to be responsible for the group’s success. You, as a manager, break down an entire project into parts and delegate them to your people. If you do this job properly, we all will succeed. But don’t try to blame us if the parts fall apart.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;youtube&quot;&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biE86esgFAE&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;box&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://i.ytimg.com/vi/biE86esgFAE/mqdefault.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;YouTube video #biE86esgFAE&quot; /&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;play&quot;&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;icon icon-play&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;div&gt;Seven Enemies of Our Motivation (in Russian with English subtitles); 25 March 2017.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t Mention Steve Jobs&lt;/strong&gt;. Try to avoid global slogans and world domination speeches in the office and in front of the team. They demotivate. If we’re doing so good, why are our salaries not reflecting this success yet? If your vision is so global, why is it not yet implemented in reality? Don’t promise to become the next Steve Jobs. Instead, become the next &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/09/22/micromanagement.html&quot;&gt;good manager&lt;/a&gt; of a highly paid team that is solving interesting problems for real people. Your practical achievements, no matter how small and down-to-earth they are, will give you much more respect than many-hour-long speeches about our fantastic future.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t Say a Word About Agile&lt;/strong&gt;. Even though &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/07/11/mistakes-in-agile-manifesto.html&quot;&gt;Agile&lt;/a&gt; is a great attitude-changing and mind-shifting concept, it is absolutely inapplicable in practice, mostly because it is too abstract. When you’re proclaiming in the office that we should value “working software over comprehensive documentation,” it sounds like you don’t know what you’re doing. The team doesn’t need such abstract slogans from you. It needs specific instructions and rules in order to follow them and produce results, money, and satisfaction. Agile is a set of abstract principles that you should understand and digest. But then, after you chew them properly, convert them to specific and very unambiguous rules of work. Don’t talk about Agile; be agile.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Give everybody an assurance that none of them will be terminated behind a closed door&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t Close the Door&lt;/strong&gt;. Responsibility is personal, &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/09/24/why-monetary-awards-dont-work.html&quot;&gt;money&lt;/a&gt; is personal, and results are personal. But their discussions should be open to everybody. Don’t close the door to that meeting room when you’re talking about problems or appraising someone’s results. You want your team to work together? Give everybody an assurance that none of them will be &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/09/16/how-to-fire-someone-right.html&quot;&gt;terminated&lt;/a&gt; behind a closed door. These pompous speeches about “us working together” usually turn into mush once the team sees that someone gets fired after a private conversation with a manager. Are we together, or is it you against us? To keep team morale up, you, as a manager, have to establish &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/10/13/competition-without-rules.html&quot;&gt;ground rules&lt;/a&gt; of work that will define who gets what when we succeed and who &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/09/16/how-to-fire-someone-right.html&quot;&gt;goes home&lt;/a&gt; first when we fail. These rules should be open to everybody. These rules should rule the team, not your personal decisions made behind a closed door.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Celebrate Achievements Instead of Birthdays&lt;/strong&gt;. Team-building events are a great tool to boost team morale, but only when they are built around personal or team achievements instead of calendar events. A project team is &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/02/18/holacracy-autocracy.html&quot;&gt;not a group of friends&lt;/a&gt; or family members, even though some teams may feel like that. No matter how it feels, a team is here for one reason—to create the product and make money for its sponsor. This is the direction we’re going. Our goal is not to build a community and live together til the end of our days. Our goal is to achieve the business success of the product we’re developing, or in other words, complete the project. When the only events we’re celebrating are our birthdays, that’s a sign to us that our managers are trying to lie to us. They are pretending that we’re here to make a community of friends while in reality they are using us to build their business. It’s unhealthy and ruins team morale. Instead, celebrate achievements on your real path—to the success of the product under development. This will show everybody that you, as a manager, are honest with your people and ready to show them that their true role on the team is to develop a product and earn money for its investors. Honesty is the best team morale booster.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Honesty is the best team morale booster&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t Rule; Make Rules and Plans&lt;/strong&gt;. Nothing demotivates more than an unpredictable &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/05/24/who-is-project-manager.html&quot;&gt;manager&lt;/a&gt;. For the team, you are an abstraction of the entire world around the team. They see the reality through the prism of your personality. What you tell them about the reality is what they perceive. If you are unpredictable, the reality is unpredictable and scary for them. To avoid that, stop making decisions that are based on your personal and momentary judgment. Instead, make decisions that are based on the rules you’ve defined upfront and plans you’ve drawn beforehand. First, create a plan for team growth and announce it to everybody. The plan should include risks and their mitigation actions. The plan should say who will be fired first when or if the project goes down. The plan should give a predictable and measurable picture of the reality around your office. It should be a map of terrain you’re going to cross with your team. When it’s time to make a decision, everybody will understand why it’s made and will respect you as a manager who predicted the situation and managed it professionally.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Everybody should know everybody's salaries, bonuses, and benefits&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Put Money on the Table&lt;/strong&gt;. Discuss money openly and freely, right in the office, right in front of everybody. This advice is for true professionals. If you can’t do what is said above, don’t even try this one. But if you consider yourself a real pro in management and leadership, you should put money on the table and let everybody know who is getting what, when, why, and why not. Everybody should know everybody’s salaries, bonuses, benefits, and the rationale behind them. Each programmer should know what he or she should do in order to get a $5,000 raise to their annual salary. Also, he or she should know why a colleague is called “senior developer” while his or her title is still “junior.” This information should be public and printed on the wall right behind your chair. Why don’t most managers do this? Because they don’t have any &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/09/24/why-monetary-awards-dont-work.html&quot;&gt;rationale&lt;/a&gt; behind their monetary decisions. Instead of managing the money, they let money manage them.&lt;/p&gt; " /> <meta name="keywords" content="next, path, output, content, previous, url, relative_path, id, collection, excerpt, draft, categories, layout, title, date, tags, description, keywords, related, social, image, jb_picture, buffer, slug, ext" /> <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1"/> <meta name="google-site-verification" content="JEj_gQr2CPe2QKGw8XdMz0R7VboQIUbX3FlM-lwTq-8" /> <meta name="author" content="Yegor Bugayenko"> <meta name="article:published_time" content="2015-03-02 00:00:00 +0000"> <meta name="og:site_name" content="Yegor Bugayenko"/> <meta name="og:type" content="article" /> <meta name="og:locale" content="en_US" /> <meta name="twitter:account_id" content="4503599630178231" /> <meta name="twitter:creator" content="@yegor256"/> <meta name="twitter:site" content="@yegor256"/> <meta name="twitter:title" property="og:title" content="Team Morale: Myths and Reality"/> <meta name="twitter:description" property="og:description" content="&lt;p&gt;There are plenty of books, articles, and blog posts about &lt;em&gt;team morale&lt;/em&gt;.

Your team is following you and expecting you to be a smart manager. While they are writing Java, you’re talking to investors and customers. They want to be sure you know what you’re doing. The best way to show them you have no idea where the team is going is to tell them that the future is bright and cloudless. Everybody understands that’s either a lie and you are trying to hide risks or you’re stupid enough to not see them. In either case, the best people would attempt to quit before it’s too late. Thus, to keep morale up, &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/05/21/avoid-software-outsourcing-disaster.html&quot;&gt;regularly inform&lt;/a&gt; your people about problems you’re facing and risks you’re trying to prevent. They will appreciate it and respect you. A strong, professional manager deals with risks instead of ignoring them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;A strong manager isn't afraid to look stupid in front of the team&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Failures Are Yours; Success Is Theirs&lt;/strong&gt;. Always remember that when someone on your team makes a mistake, it is first of all &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; personal mistake. You hired that person, you trained him or her, you delegated the responsibility, and you controlled and monitored the job. Then he made a mistake, and the project lost money, disappointed a customer, or damaged the firm’s reputation. Of course you need to take necessary disciplinary actions and maybe &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/09/16/how-to-fire-someone-right.html&quot;&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt; the troublemaker. But first of all, you have to admit in front of everyone that it was &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; personal mistake. You didn’t control enough, you didn’t &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/05/24/who-is-project-manager.html&quot;&gt;plan&lt;/a&gt; well, or you didn’t take preventive actions. This is what the team expects from you. Also, your people expect you to explain to them how you’re going to learn from this mistake in order to prevent a similar one from happening in the future. A strong manager isn’t afraid to look stupid in front of the team. A weak manager does look stupid when he or she tries to hide mistakes that have been made.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Responsibility Is Always Personal&lt;/strong&gt;. The most demotivating word used in task descriptions is “together.” Don’t use it. Each task has to be personally and individually assigned (no matter what the &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/07/11/mistakes-in-agile-manifesto.html&quot;&gt;Agile Manifesto&lt;/a&gt; says). Everybody is responsible for his or her own success or failure. How their results join together and lead to a mutual success or failure—that’s &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/05/24/who-is-project-manager.html&quot;&gt;business&lt;/a&gt;. Whether you succeed or fail, we all will see. Once you say we all have to succeed &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/11/21/ringelmann-effect-vs-agile.html&quot;&gt;together&lt;/a&gt;, the team understands that you’re trying to shift responsibility from your own shoulders to theirs. It’s a sign of weakness, and you lose respect. Make tasks and goals strictly personal, and be prepared to be responsible for the group’s success. You, as a manager, break down an entire project into parts and delegate them to your people. If you do this job properly, we all will succeed. But don’t try to blame us if the parts fall apart.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;youtube&quot;&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biE86esgFAE&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;box&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://i.ytimg.com/vi/biE86esgFAE/mqdefault.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;YouTube video #biE86esgFAE&quot; /&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;play&quot;&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;icon icon-play&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;div&gt;Seven Enemies of Our Motivation (in Russian with English subtitles); 25 March 2017.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t Mention Steve Jobs&lt;/strong&gt;. Try to avoid global slogans and world domination speeches in the office and in front of the team. They demotivate. If we’re doing so good, why are our salaries not reflecting this success yet? If your vision is so global, why is it not yet implemented in reality? Don’t promise to become the next Steve Jobs. Instead, become the next &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/09/22/micromanagement.html&quot;&gt;good manager&lt;/a&gt; of a highly paid team that is solving interesting problems for real people. Your practical achievements, no matter how small and down-to-earth they are, will give you much more respect than many-hour-long speeches about our fantastic future.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t Say a Word About Agile&lt;/strong&gt;. Even though &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/07/11/mistakes-in-agile-manifesto.html&quot;&gt;Agile&lt;/a&gt; is a great attitude-changing and mind-shifting concept, it is absolutely inapplicable in practice, mostly because it is too abstract. When you’re proclaiming in the office that we should value “working software over comprehensive documentation,” it sounds like you don’t know what you’re doing. The team doesn’t need such abstract slogans from you. It needs specific instructions and rules in order to follow them and produce results, money, and satisfaction. Agile is a set of abstract principles that you should understand and digest. But then, after you chew them properly, convert them to specific and very unambiguous rules of work. Don’t talk about Agile; be agile.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Give everybody an assurance that none of them will be terminated behind a closed door&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t Close the Door&lt;/strong&gt;. Responsibility is personal, &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/09/24/why-monetary-awards-dont-work.html&quot;&gt;money&lt;/a&gt; is personal, and results are personal. But their discussions should be open to everybody. Don’t close the door to that meeting room when you’re talking about problems or appraising someone’s results. You want your team to work together? Give everybody an assurance that none of them will be &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/09/16/how-to-fire-someone-right.html&quot;&gt;terminated&lt;/a&gt; behind a closed door. These pompous speeches about “us working together” usually turn into mush once the team sees that someone gets fired after a private conversation with a manager. Are we together, or is it you against us? To keep team morale up, you, as a manager, have to establish &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/10/13/competition-without-rules.html&quot;&gt;ground rules&lt;/a&gt; of work that will define who gets what when we succeed and who &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/09/16/how-to-fire-someone-right.html&quot;&gt;goes home&lt;/a&gt; first when we fail. These rules should be open to everybody. These rules should rule the team, not your personal decisions made behind a closed door.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Celebrate Achievements Instead of Birthdays&lt;/strong&gt;. Team-building events are a great tool to boost team morale, but only when they are built around personal or team achievements instead of calendar events. A project team is &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/02/18/holacracy-autocracy.html&quot;&gt;not a group of friends&lt;/a&gt; or family members, even though some teams may feel like that. No matter how it feels, a team is here for one reason—to create the product and make money for its sponsor. This is the direction we’re going. Our goal is not to build a community and live together til the end of our days. Our goal is to achieve the business success of the product we’re developing, or in other words, complete the project. When the only events we’re celebrating are our birthdays, that’s a sign to us that our managers are trying to lie to us. They are pretending that we’re here to make a community of friends while in reality they are using us to build their business. It’s unhealthy and ruins team morale. Instead, celebrate achievements on your real path—to the success of the product under development. This will show everybody that you, as a manager, are honest with your people and ready to show them that their true role on the team is to develop a product and earn money for its investors. Honesty is the best team morale booster.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Honesty is the best team morale booster&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t Rule; Make Rules and Plans&lt;/strong&gt;. Nothing demotivates more than an unpredictable &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/05/24/who-is-project-manager.html&quot;&gt;manager&lt;/a&gt;. For the team, you are an abstraction of the entire world around the team. They see the reality through the prism of your personality. What you tell them about the reality is what they perceive. If you are unpredictable, the reality is unpredictable and scary for them. To avoid that, stop making decisions that are based on your personal and momentary judgment. Instead, make decisions that are based on the rules you’ve defined upfront and plans you’ve drawn beforehand. First, create a plan for team growth and announce it to everybody. The plan should include risks and their mitigation actions. The plan should say who will be fired first when or if the project goes down. The plan should give a predictable and measurable picture of the reality around your office. It should be a map of terrain you’re going to cross with your team. When it’s time to make a decision, everybody will understand why it’s made and will respect you as a manager who predicted the situation and managed it professionally.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Everybody should know everybody's salaries, bonuses, and benefits&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Put Money on the Table&lt;/strong&gt;. Discuss money openly and freely, right in the office, right in front of everybody. This advice is for true professionals. If you can’t do what is said above, don’t even try this one. But if you consider yourself a real pro in management and leadership, you should put money on the table and let everybody know who is getting what, when, why, and why not. Everybody should know everybody’s salaries, bonuses, benefits, and the rationale behind them. Each programmer should know what he or she should do in order to get a $5,000 raise to their annual salary. Also, he or she should know why a colleague is called “senior developer” while his or her title is still “junior.” This information should be public and printed on the wall right behind your chair. Why don’t most managers do this? Because they don’t have any &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/09/24/why-monetary-awards-dont-work.html&quot;&gt;rationale&lt;/a&gt; behind their monetary decisions. Instead of managing the money, they let money manage them.&lt;/p&gt; "/> <meta name="twitter:url" property="og:url" content="https://www.yegor256.com/2015/03/02/team-morale-myths-and-reality.html"/>

<em>team morale</em>. They will all suggest you do things like regular celebrations, team events, free lunches, pet-friendly offices, coffee machines, birthday presents, etc. All of these are instruments of <a href="/2015/10/06/how-to-be-good-office-slave.html"><strong>concealed enslaving</strong></a>. These traditional techniques turn employees into speechless monkeys, programming under the influence of Prozac. Their existence and <a href="/2015/10/16/ridley-scott-and-joseph-goebbels.html">popularity</a> is our big misfortune.

To keep team morale up, you, as a manager, have to establish <a href="/2015/10/13/competition-without-rules.html">ground rules</a> of work that will define who gets what when we succeed and who <a href="/2015/09/16/how-to-fire-someone-right.html">goes home</a> first when we fail. These rules should be open to everybody. These rules should rule the team, not your personal decisions made behind a closed door.</p><p><strong>Celebrate Achievements Instead of Birthdays</strong>. Team-building events are a great tool to boost team morale, but only when they are built around personal or team achievements instead of calendar events. A project team is <a href="/2016/02/18/holacracy-autocracy.html">not a group of friends</a> or family members, even though some teams may feel like that. No matter how it feels, a team is here for one reason—to create the product and make money for its sponsor. This is the direction we’re going. Our goal is not to build a community and live together til the end of our days. Our goal is to achieve the business success of the product we’re developing, or in other words, complete the project. When the only events we’re celebrating are our birthdays, that’s a sign to us that our managers are trying to lie to us. They are pretending that we’re here to make a community of friends while in reality they are using us to build their business. It’s unhealthy and ruins team morale. Instead, celebrate achievements on your real path—to the success of the product under development. This will show everybody that you, as a manager, are honest with your people and ready to show them that their true role on the team is to develop a product and earn money for its investors. Honesty is the best team morale booster.</p><aside class="quote">Honesty is the best team morale booster</aside><p><strong>Don’t Rule; Make Rules and Plans</strong>.

Also, he or she should know why a colleague is called “senior developer” while his or her title is still “junior.” This information should be public and printed on the wall right behind your chair. Why don’t most managers do this? Because they don’t have any <a href="/2014/09/24/why-monetary-awards-dont-work.html">rationale</a> behind their monetary decisions.

They will all suggest you do things like regular celebrations, team events, free lunches, pet-friendly offices, coffee machines, birthday presents, etc. All of these are instruments of <a href="/2015/10/06/how-to-be-good-office-slave.html"><strong>concealed enslaving</strong></a>. These traditional techniques turn employees into speechless monkeys, programming under the influence of Prozac. Their existence and <a href="/2015/10/16/ridley-scott-and-joseph-goebbels.html">popularity</a> is our big misfortune.

The first and most important quality of a good manager is his or her ability to separate bad apples from good ones as soon as possible. Nothing will earn you more disrespect from your team than tolerance of <a href="/2015/10/13/competition-without-rules.html">under-performing</a> team members. Your job as a manager is to help the best players play better, and they can’t play better if they see that management doesn’t understand the difference between excellence and mediocrity. It’s a severe demotivating factor.</p><aside class="youtube"> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibT5oKToMoQ"><div class="box"> <img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ibT5oKToMoQ/mqdefault.jpg" alt="YouTube video #ibT5oKToMoQ" /><div class="play"><i class="icon icon-play"></i></div></div></a><div>Daily Stand-Up Meetings Are Evil (webinar #11); 3 February 2016.</div></aside><p><strong>Be Honest About Problems and Risks</strong>. Your team is following you and expecting you to be a smart manager. While they are writing Java, you’re talking to investors and customers. They want to be sure you know what you’re doing. The best way to show them you have no idea where the team is going is to tell them that the future is bright and cloudless. Everybody understands that’s either a lie and you are trying to hide risks or you’re stupid enough to not see them. In either case, the best people would attempt to quit before it’s too late. Thus, to keep morale up, <a href="/2015/05/21/avoid-software-outsourcing-disaster.html">regularly inform</a> your people about problems you’re facing and risks you’re trying to prevent. They will appreciate it and respect you. A strong, professional manager deals with risks instead of ignoring them.</p><aside class="quote">A strong manager isn't afraid to look stupid in front of the team</aside><p><strong>Failures Are Yours; Success Is Theirs</strong>. Always remember that when someone on your team makes a mistake, it is first of all <em>your</em> personal mistake. You hired that person, you trained him or her, you delegated the responsibility, and you controlled and monitored the job. Then he made a mistake, and the project lost money, disappointed a customer, or damaged the firm’s reputation. Of course you need to take necessary disciplinary actions and maybe <a href="/2015/09/16/how-to-fire-someone-right.html">fire</a> the troublemaker. But first of all, you have to admit in front of everyone that it was <em>your</em> personal mistake. You didn’t control enough, you didn’t <a href="/2016/05/24/who-is-project-manager.html">plan</a> well, or you didn’t take preventive actions. This is what the team expects from you. Also, your people expect you to explain to them how you’re going to learn from this mistake in order to prevent a similar one from happening in the future. A strong manager isn’t afraid to look stupid in front of the team. A weak manager does look stupid when he or she tries to hide mistakes that have been made.</p><p><strong>Responsibility Is Always Personal</strong>. The most demotivating word used in task descriptions is “together.” Don’t use it. Each task has to be personally and individually assigned (no matter what the <a href="/2016/07/11/mistakes-in-agile-manifesto.html">Agile Manifesto</a> says). Everybody is responsible for his or her own success or failure. How their results join together and lead to a mutual success or failure—that’s <em>your</em> <a href="/2016/05/24/who-is-project-manager.html">business</a>. Whether you succeed or fail, we all will see. Once you say we all have to succeed <a href="/2015/11/21/ringelmann-effect-vs-agile.html">together</a>, the team understands that you’re trying to shift responsibility from your own shoulders to theirs. It’s a sign of weakness, and you lose respect. Make tasks and goals strictly personal, and be prepared to be responsible for the group’s success. You, as a manager, break down an entire project into parts and delegate them to your people. If you do this job properly, we all will succeed. But don’t try to blame us if the parts fall apart.</p><aside class="youtube"> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biE86esgFAE"><div class="box"> <img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/biE86esgFAE/mqdefault.jpg" alt="YouTube video #biE86esgFAE" /><div class="play"><i class="icon icon-play"></i></div></div></a><div>Seven Enemies of Our Motivation (in Russian with English subtitles); 25 March 2017.</div></aside><p><strong>Don’t Mention Steve Jobs</strong>. Try to avoid global slogans and world domination speeches in the office and in front of the team. They demotivate. If we’re doing so good, why are our salaries not reflecting this success yet? If your vision is so global, why is it not yet implemented in reality? Don’t promise to become the next Steve Jobs. Instead, become the next <a href="/2015/09/22/micromanagement.html">good manager</a> of a highly paid team that is solving interesting problems for real people. Your practical achievements, no matter how small and down-to-earth they are, will give you much more respect than many-hour-long speeches about our fantastic future.</p><p><strong>Don’t Say a Word About Agile</strong>. Even though <a href="/2016/07/11/mistakes-in-agile-manifesto.html">Agile</a> is a great attitude-changing and mind-shifting concept, it is absolutely inapplicable in practice, mostly because it is too abstract. When you’re proclaiming in the office that we should value “working software over comprehensive documentation,” it sounds like you don’t know what you’re doing. The team doesn’t need such abstract slogans from you. It needs specific instructions and rules in order to follow them and produce results, money, and satisfaction. Agile is a set of abstract principles that you should understand and digest. But then, after you chew them properly, convert them to specific and very unambiguous rules of work. Don’t talk about Agile; be agile.</p><aside class="quote">Give everybody an assurance that none of them will be terminated behind a closed door</aside><p><strong>Don’t Close the Door</strong>.

I came to him because I assumed he knew more about this business than I did. I chose him through the assistance of Yelp. I wanted &lt;em&gt;him&lt;/em&gt; to tell me how long the hair on the sides should be and how much should be removed on the top. I expected &lt;em&gt;him&lt;/em&gt; to give me his professional judgment and stand by it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Instead of asking me how much I wanted removed on the sides, he should have told me there should be less on the sides.

He tried to &lt;em&gt;please&lt;/em&gt; me. In the end, he lost.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Exactly the same thing happens when we ask our customers about the technologies they want us to use. I hear this question very often: &lt;em&gt;What language do you want us to use&lt;/em&gt; (meaning Java or Ruby or something else)? Or &lt;em&gt;what database should we use?&lt;/em&gt; Or &lt;em&gt;how do you want us to design this?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Don’t do that. Don’t lose like that hairdresser.

How could this happen if he was so friendly and nice?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;!--more--&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;jb_picture&quot;&gt;&lt;img itemprop=&quot;image&quot; alt=&quot;The Man Who Wasn&amp;#39;t There (2001) by Coen Brothers&quot; src=&quot;/images/2015/02/the-man-who-wasnt-there.jpg&quot; longdesc=&quot;#243d0d7c&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption id=&quot;243d0d7c&quot;&gt;The Man Who Wasn&amp;#39;t There (2001) by Coen Brothers&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;I’m not a hairdresser, and I have very little understanding of how to deal with hair. I came to him because I assumed he knew more about this business than I did. I chose him through the assistance of Yelp. I wanted &lt;em&gt;him&lt;/em&gt; to tell me how long the hair on the sides should be and how much should be removed on the top. I expected &lt;em&gt;him&lt;/em&gt; to give me his professional judgment and stand by it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Instead of asking me how much I wanted removed on the sides, he should have told me there should be less on the sides. This is what a true professional would do. A true professional would give me &lt;em&gt;his&lt;/em&gt; vision of the haircut that best suits me and would try to convince me that it was the best choice.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;He tried to please me. In the end, he lost.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;A true professional would not ask me but would &lt;em&gt;tell&lt;/em&gt; me instead, because he would understand that my goal was not to boss him around and make him do my hair the way I wanted it. My goal was to get the best out of his professional skill.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the guy was either weak or immature. He didn’t argue with me and didn’t try to convince me. He tried to &lt;em&gt;please&lt;/em&gt; me. In the end, he lost.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Exactly the same thing happens when we ask our customers about the technologies they want us to use. I hear this question very often: &lt;em&gt;What language do you want us to use&lt;/em&gt; (meaning Java or Ruby or something else)? Or &lt;em&gt;what database should we use?&lt;/em&gt; Or &lt;em&gt;how do you want us to design this?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Don’t do that. Don’t lose like that hairdresser. Don’t ask your clients what they want. Instead, &lt;em&gt;learn&lt;/em&gt; their business requirements and then &lt;em&gt;suggest&lt;/em&gt; the solution you think is the best for them. Then, insist and argue if they don’t agree. &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/07/21/convince-me.html&quot;&gt;Convince&lt;/a&gt; them. Even if they fire you in the end for your stubbornness, it’s better than being that hairdresser who is doomed to please every single client without getting anywhere further.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Remember, the &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/01/26/happy-boss-false-objective.html&quot;&gt;client&lt;/a&gt; is not the king; his hairs are.&lt;/p&gt; "/> <meta name="twitter:url" property="og:url"

Besides that, we &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/04/13/bugs-are-welcome.html&quot;&gt;encourage&lt;/a&gt; every developer on every project to report bugs whenever he or she finds them. We even &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/04/17/how-xdsd-is-different.html&quot;&gt;pay&lt;/a&gt; for each bug found. Once in a while, I see bugs reported along these lines: “&lt;em&gt;Can someone explain to me how to design this module?&lt;/em&gt;” or even “&lt;em&gt;I haven’t used this library before; please help me get started&lt;/em&gt;.” My usual answer is, “&lt;em&gt;This is not a school; nobody is going to teach you here!&lt;/em&gt;” I realize this sounds rather harsh to most developers who are just starting to work with us, so here I’ll try to illustrate why such an attitude makes sense and is beneficial to both the programmers and the project.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Disclaimer: I’m talking about software &lt;em&gt;projects&lt;/em&gt; here, which PMBOK defines as “&lt;em&gt;temporary&lt;/em&gt; endeavors undertaken to create unique products, services, or results.” If your team is engaged in &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/02/18/holacracy-autocracy.html&quot;&gt;continuous development&lt;/a&gt; or maintenance of software, this concept may not be relevant.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;!--more--&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;jb_picture&quot;&gt;&lt;img itemprop=&quot;image&quot; alt=&quot;G.I.

Jane (1997) by Ridley Scott&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;No matter how unpleasant this could be, let’s face the reality: each software project is a business, and we, the developers, are its &lt;em&gt;resources&lt;/em&gt;. Just like concrete, wood, and glass are the resources required to build a house, which is also a business activity. No matter how much we think about ourselves as a family having fun together and writing code because we enjoy it, each business looks at it completely differently.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The project needs us to &lt;em&gt;produce&lt;/em&gt; classes, lines of code, methods, functions, files, and features. Then, the project can convert them into happy customers, which will give us something back—usually cash. Finally, the project will share that cash among us, &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/12/16/investors-are-too-scared.html&quot;&gt;investors&lt;/a&gt;, and the government.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;youtube&quot;&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBQoTZ-1X-o&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;box&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YBQoTZ-1X-o/mqdefault.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;YouTube video #YBQoTZ-1X-o&quot; /&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;play&quot;&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;icon icon-play&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;div&gt;How to Cut Corners and Stay Cool (webinar #15); 1 June 2016.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;A properly planned and managed project acquires the best resources its budget can afford and then relies on their quality. A programmer who doesn’t have adequate skills or knowledge is an &lt;em&gt;unreliable resource&lt;/em&gt;. Obviously, no project would acquire such a resource from the start. However, this weakness may be revealed in the middle of the project.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Say you’re building a house and you contracted a plumber to install a drainage system. When it’s time to mount the equipment, he tells you that he’s never worked with it and doesn’t know how to install it. It was a risk, and it occurred. A good &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/09/22/micromanagement.html&quot;&gt;project manager&lt;/a&gt; always has a fallback plan or even a few of them. Obviously, the best option would be to contract &lt;em&gt;another&lt;/em&gt; plumber. The worst option would be to train the original one on the spot.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;The goal of the project is to build a house, not to train a plumber&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;Wait, why is that so obvious? The plumber is a great guy. Yes, he doesn’t know how to work with this equipment, but that doesn’t mean we should &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/09/16/how-to-fire-someone-right.html&quot;&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt; him immediately. Let’s pay for his training, send him to some courses, buy him some books, let him experiment with the equipment for some time, and then he will be able to install it in our house. Great plan, isn’t it? The plumber will be happy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But the project won’t.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The goal of the project is to build a house, not to train a plumber. The project doesn’t even have funds to train the bloody plumber! If we train and teach all our workers, we won’t ever build a house. We’re not running a school here. We’re building a house!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While working on a software project, a good project manager has a staffing management plan that describes how skills will be recruited, tested, applied, and discharged when necessary. Such a plan may include training, but it would be as small an amount as possible—mostly because a plumber trained by us &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/06/02/how-to-estimate-software-cost.html&quot;&gt;costs&lt;/a&gt; much more than one trained by someone else but does exactly the same, or worse, work. Thus, a smart project manager acquires project members who are already capable of performing their duties and falls back on training only in exceptional situations.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;If you make your projects spend their money on your education, that's theft&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now, a logical question: What should we, as programmers, do? We want to learn, and we don’t want to spend our own money on it. We don’t want to sit home for a few years learning all possible technologies before entering the job market as experts, ready to be hired. We want to learn on the job. We basically want to use project budgets for our own personal educational needs. Moreover, a smart programmer exits every project with some new knowledge, new skills, and new technologies in his or her portfolio.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, if you make your projects spend their money on your education, that’s theft. And a good project manager should stop you, saying “This is not a school!”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What is the solution?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I believe that in the software business, there is only one workaround—blame the project for your own deficiencies in education, skills, or information. I’m being absolutely serious. Let’s discuss a few practical situations.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Say you have a module to work with, and it has to be written in Python. You have no experience in Python; you’re a Java developer. Who is at fault here? You could think of it as your problem and ask your project manager to teach you, but he should tell you he’s not running a school and get rid of you. That’s a bad scenario for both of you. Instead, blame the project manager. He &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/06/21/how-to-hire-programmer.html&quot;&gt;hired&lt;/a&gt; you. He put you into this situation. He planned all project activities, so he probably knows what he is doing. This means that the project &lt;em&gt;documentation&lt;/em&gt; should be detailed enough for a Java developer to create that Python module. However, it is not detailed enough. So report this &lt;em&gt;issue&lt;/em&gt; and wait for its &lt;em&gt;resolution&lt;/em&gt;. Explain in your &lt;a href=&quot;/2018/04/24/right-way-to-report-bugs.html&quot;&gt;bug report&lt;/a&gt; that you honestly started to work with the module and realized that its documentation is not complete enough for a Java developer to understand. Ask the project manager to fix this. If the project decides to invest its money into the documentation, you have the chance to read it and learn. Thus, the project’s money spent on your education will also contribute to the project. It’s a win-win.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Here is another example: Say you have to fix a Java module and you’re a Java developer. You understand Java, but you don’t understand how this algorithm works. You could blame yourself for not reading &lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/2c5o1n2&quot;&gt;Knuth&lt;/a&gt; in school and ask the project to train you on it. A good and strong project manager should tell you that it’s not a school and get rid of you. Again, a bad scenario for both of you. Instead, blame the project. The code is &lt;em&gt;not self-descriptive&lt;/em&gt; and is difficult to understand. The algorithm implementation is &lt;em&gt;not obvious&lt;/em&gt; and is poorly documented. Ask for better documentation. If the project invests its money into the documentation, you will learn the algorithm from it. The source code will be improved, and you will have improved your skills. Win-win.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One more example: Say you are tasked to implement a WebSockets back-end in an existing web app. You know how WebSockets work but can’t understand how to connect this new back-end to the existing persistence layer. You are rather new to the project and don’t understand what would be the right design. You could ask for the project to provide training to explain how the code works and how it can be extended with features like this one. A project manager should tell you that you’re not in school and are supposed to understand the software if the project is paying you a software developer &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/12/06/how-to-pay-programmers-less.html&quot;&gt;salary&lt;/a&gt;. And he will be right. But it’s a bad scenario for both of you. Instead, blame the project for &lt;em&gt;incomplete&lt;/em&gt; design documentation. Good software should properly document its architecture and design. Ask for the project to provide such documentation. If it invests its time and money into better documentation, you will learn from it and find all the necessary answers. Another win-win.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are a few other examples in my &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/01/15/how-to-cut-corners.html&quot;&gt;How to Cut Corners and Stay Cool&lt;/a&gt; post.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In conclusion, I would recommend you remember that software projects are, first and foremost, business activities where we, the developers, are &lt;em&gt;resources&lt;/em&gt;. In order to obtain something for ourselves in terms of education and training, we should align our goals with project objectives. Instead of asking for help and information, we should blame the project for its lack of documentation. By fixing this flaw, the project will improve its artifacts and, at the same time, provide valuable knowledge to us, its participants.&lt;/p&gt; " /> <meta name="keywords" content="next, path, output, content, previous, url, relative_path, id, collection, excerpt, draft, categories, layout, title, date, tags, description, keywords, image, jb_picture, slug, ext" /> <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1"/> <meta name="google-site-verification" content="JEj_gQr2CPe2QKGw8XdMz0R7VboQIUbX3FlM-lwTq-8" /> <meta name="author" content="Yegor Bugayenko"> <meta name="article:published_time" content="2015-02-16 00:00:00 +0000"> <meta name="og:site_name" content="Yegor Bugayenko"/> <meta name="og:type" content="article" /> <meta name="og:locale" content="en_US" /> <meta name="twitter:account_id" content="4503599630178231" /> <meta name="twitter:creator" content="@yegor256"/> <meta name="twitter:site" content="@yegor256"/> <meta name="twitter:title" property="og:title" content="It's Not a School!"/> <meta name="twitter:description" property="og:description" content="&lt;p&gt;At &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zerocracy.com&quot;&gt;Zerocracy&lt;/a&gt;, we work in distributed teams and keep all our communications &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/10/07/stop-chatting-start-coding.html&quot;&gt;in tickets&lt;/a&gt;. Besides that, we &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/04/13/bugs-are-welcome.html&quot;&gt;encourage&lt;/a&gt; every developer on every project to report bugs whenever he or she finds them. We even &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/04/17/how-xdsd-is-different.html&quot;&gt;pay&lt;/a&gt; for each bug found. Once in a while, I see bugs reported along these lines: “&lt;em&gt;Can someone explain to me how to design this module?&lt;/em&gt;” or even “&lt;em&gt;I haven’t used this library before; please help me get started&lt;/em&gt;.” My usual answer is, “&lt;em&gt;This is not a school; nobody is going to teach you here!&lt;/em&gt;” I realize this sounds rather harsh to most developers who are just starting to work with us, so here I’ll try to illustrate why such an attitude makes sense and is beneficial to both the programmers and the project.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Disclaimer: I’m talking about software &lt;em&gt;projects&lt;/em&gt; here, which PMBOK defines as “&lt;em&gt;temporary&lt;/em&gt; endeavors undertaken to create unique products, services, or results.” If your team is engaged in &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/02/18/holacracy-autocracy.html&quot;&gt;continuous development&lt;/a&gt; or maintenance of software, this concept may not be relevant.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;!--more--&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;jb_picture&quot;&gt;&lt;img itemprop=&quot;image&quot; alt=&quot;G.I.

No matter how much we think about ourselves as a family having fun together and writing code because we enjoy it, each business looks at it completely differently.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The project needs us to &lt;em&gt;produce&lt;/em&gt; classes, lines of code, methods, functions, files, and features.

When it’s time to mount the equipment, he tells you that he’s never worked with it and doesn’t know how to install it. It was a risk, and it occurred. A good <a href="/2015/09/22/micromanagement.html">project manager</a> always has a fallback plan or even a few of them. Obviously, the best option would be to contract <em>another</em> plumber. The worst option would be to train the original one on the spot.</p><aside class="quote">The goal of the project is to build a house, not to train a plumber</aside><p>Wait, why is that so obvious? The plumber is a great guy. Yes, he doesn’t know how to work with this equipment, but that doesn’t mean we should <a href="/2015/09/16/how-to-fire-someone-right.html">fire</a> him immediately. Let’s pay for his training, send him to some courses, buy him some books, let him experiment with the equipment for some time, and then he will be able to install it in our house. Great plan, isn’t it? The plumber will be happy.</p><p>But the project won’t.</p><p>The goal of the project is to build a house, not to train a plumber. The project doesn’t even have funds to train the bloody plumber! If we train and teach all our workers, we won’t ever build a house. We’re not running a school here. We’re building a house!</p><p>While working on a software project, a good project manager has a staffing management plan that describes how skills will be recruited, tested, applied, and discharged when necessary. Such a plan may include training, but it would be as small an amount as possible—mostly because a plumber trained by us <a href="/2015/06/02/how-to-estimate-software-cost.html">costs</a> much more than one trained by someone else but does exactly the same, or worse, work. Thus, a smart project manager acquires project members who are already capable of performing their duties and falls back on training only in exceptional situations.</p><aside class="quote">If you make your projects spend their money on your education, that's theft</aside><p>Now, a logical question: What should we, as programmers, do? We want to learn, and we don’t want to spend our own money on it. We don’t want to sit home for a few years learning all possible technologies before entering the job market as experts, ready to be hired. We want to learn on the job. We basically want to use project budgets for our own personal educational needs. Moreover, a smart programmer exits every project with some new knowledge, new skills, and new technologies in his or her portfolio.</p><p>However, if you make your projects spend their money on your education, that’s theft. And a good project manager should stop you, saying “This is not a school!”</p><p>What is the solution?</p><p>I believe that in the software business, there is only one workaround—blame the project for your own deficiencies in education, skills, or information. I’m being absolutely serious. Let’s discuss a few practical situations.</p><p>Say you have a module to work with, and it has to be written in Python. You have no experience in Python; you’re a Java developer. Who is at fault here? You could think of it as your problem and ask your project manager to teach you, but he should tell you he’s not running a school and get rid of you. That’s a bad scenario for both of you. Instead, blame the project manager. He <a href="/2016/06/21/how-to-hire-programmer.html">hired</a> you. He put you into this situation. He planned all project activities, so he probably knows what he is doing. This means that the project <em>documentation</em> should be detailed enough for a Java developer to create that Python module. However, it is not detailed enough. So report this <em>issue</em> and wait for its <em>resolution</em>. Explain in your <a href="/2018/04/24/right-way-to-report-bugs.html">bug report</a> that you honestly started to work with the module and realized that its documentation is not complete enough for a Java developer to understand. Ask the project manager to fix this. If the project decides to invest its money into the documentation, you have the chance to read it and learn. Thus, the project’s money spent on your education will also contribute to the project. It’s a win-win.</p><p>Here is another example: Say you have to fix a Java module and you’re a Java developer. You understand Java, but you don’t understand how this algorithm works. You could blame yourself for not reading <a href="http://amzn.to/2c5o1n2">Knuth</a> in school and ask the project to train you on it. A good and strong project manager should tell you that it’s not a school and get rid of you. Again, a bad scenario for both of you. Instead, blame the project. The code is <em>not self-descriptive</em> and is difficult to understand. The algorithm implementation is <em>not obvious</em> and is poorly documented. Ask for better documentation. If the project invests its money into the documentation, you will learn the algorithm from it. The source code will be improved, and you will have improved your skills. Win-win.</p><p>One more example: Say you are tasked to implement a WebSockets back-end in an existing web app. You know how WebSockets work but can’t understand how to connect this new back-end to the existing persistence layer. You are rather new to the project and don’t understand what would be the right design. You could ask for the project to provide training to explain how the code works and how it can be extended with features like this one. A project manager should tell you that you’re not in school and are supposed to understand the software if the project is paying you a software developer <a href="/2016/12/06/how-to-pay-programmers-less.html">salary</a>. And he will be right. But it’s a bad scenario for both of you. Instead, blame the project for <em>incomplete</em> design documentation. Good software should properly document its architecture and design. Ask for the project to provide such documentation. If it invests its time and money into better documentation, you will learn from it and find all the necessary answers. Another win-win.</p><p>There are a few other examples in my <a href="/2015/01/15/how-to-cut-corners.html">How to Cut Corners and Stay Cool</a> post.</p><p>In conclusion, I would recommend you remember that software projects are, first and foremost, business activities where we, the developers, are <em>resources</em>. In order to obtain something for ourselves in terms of education and training, we should align our goals with project objectives. Instead of asking for help and information, we should blame the project for its lack of documentation. By fixing this flaw, the project will improve its artifacts and, at the same time, provide valuable knowledge to us, its participants.</p></p><nav class="buttons notranslate desktop-only"> <a href="http://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://www.yegor256.com/2015/02/16/it-is-not-a-school.html" title="Share on Facebook" class="button" rel="nofollow"> <span class="count count-facebook">0</span> <i class="icon icon-facebook notranslate" aria-hidden="true"></i> </a> <a href="https://twitter.com/share?url=https://www.yegor256.com/2015/02/16/it-is-not-a-school.html&amp;text=It%27s+Not+a+School%21" title="Share on Twitter" class="button" rel="nofollow"> <span class="count count-twitter">0</span> <i class="icon icon-twitter notranslate" aria-hidden="true"></i> </a> <a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=https://www.yegor256.com/2015/02/16/it-is-not-a-school.html" title="Share on Google+" class="button" rel="nofollow"> <span class="count count-googleplus">0</span> <i class="icon icon-googleplus notranslate" aria-hidden="true"></i> </a> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/cws/share?url=https://www.yegor256.com/2015/02/16/it-is-not-a-school.html" title="Share on LinkedIn" class="button" rel="nofollow"> <span class="count count-linkedin">0</span> <i class="icon icon-linkedin notranslate" aria-hidden="true"></i> </a> <a href="http://reddit.com/submit?url=https://www.yegor256.com/2015/02/16/it-is-not-a-school.html%3F2015-07&amp;title=It%27s+Not+a+School%21" title="Share on Reddit" class="button" rel="nofollow"> <span class="count count-reddit">0</span> <i class="icon icon-reddit notranslate" aria-hidden="true"></i> </a> <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/submitlink?u=https://www.yegor256.com/2015/02/16/it-is-not-a-school.html%3F2015-07&amp;t=It%27s+Not+a+School%21" title="Share on Hacker News" class="button" rel="nofollow"> <span class="count count-hackernews">0</span> <i class="icon icon-hackernews notranslate" aria-hidden="true"></i> </a> </nav> </header> <article class="main" itemprop="articleBody"><div ><p>At <a href="https://www.zerocracy.com">Zerocracy</a>, we work in distributed teams and keep all our communications <a href="/2014/10/07/stop-chatting-start-coding.html">in tickets</a>.

Let’s see what I mean through a practical example.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;!--more--&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;jb_picture&quot;&gt;&lt;img itemprop=&quot;image&quot; alt=&quot;Delicatessen (1991) by Jean-Pierre Jeunet&quot; src=&quot;/images/2015/02/delicatessen.png&quot; longdesc=&quot;#077c7d62&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption id=&quot;077c7d62&quot;&gt;Delicatessen (1991) by Jean-Pierre Jeunet&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Say I’m contracted by a friend of mine to create a word-counting command line tool very similar to &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wc_%28Unix%29&quot;&gt;wc&lt;/a&gt;. He promised to pay me $200 for this work, and I promised him I’d deliver the product in two increments—an alpha and beta version. I promised him I’d release the alpha version on Saturday and the beta version on Sunday.

Wait, the deal was to deliver two versions and get cash in two installments. Let’s back up a little and think—how can we break this small tool into two parts?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On first thought, let’s release the tool itself first and build automation and testing next. Is that a good idea? Can we deliver any software without running it first with a test? How can I be sure that it works if I don’t ship tests together with it? What will my friend think about me releasing anything without tests? This would be a total embarrassment.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Okay, let’s release &lt;code&gt;Makefile&lt;/code&gt; first and &lt;code&gt;wc.c&lt;/code&gt; next. But what will my friend do with a couple of tests and no product in hand? This first release will be absolutely pointless, and I won’t get my $100.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Every new increment must add some value to the product as it is perceived by the customer, not by us programmers&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now we’re getting to the point of this article. What I’m trying to say is that every new increment must add some value to the product as it is perceived by the customer, not by us programmers. The &lt;code&gt;Makefile&lt;/code&gt; is definitely a valuable artifact, but it provides no value to my friend. He doesn’t need it, but I need it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Here is what I’m going to do. I’ll release a skeleton of the tool, backed by the tests but with an absolutely dummy implementation. Look at it:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-c&quot; data-lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;cp&quot;&gt;#include&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;cpf&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;stdio.h&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;cp&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;main&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;printf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;And I will modify the &lt;code&gt;Makefile&lt;/code&gt; accordingly. I will disable the first test to make sure the build passes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Does my tool work? Yes, it does. Does it count words? Yes, it does for some inputs. Does it have value to my friend. Obviously! He can run it from the command line, and he can pass a file as an input. He will always get number “5” as a result of counting, though. That’s a bummer, but it’s an alpha version. He doesn’t expect it to work perfectly.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, it works, it is backed by tests, and it is properly packaged.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What I just did is a top-down approach to design. First of all, I created something that provides value to my customer. I made sure it also satisfies my technical objectives, like proper unit test coverage and build automation. But the most important goal for me was to make sure my friend received something … and paid me.&lt;/p&gt; " /> <meta name="keywords" content="next, path, output, content, previous, url, relative_path, id, collection, excerpt, draft, categories, layout, title, date, tags, description, keywords, image, jb_picture, slug, ext" /> <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1"/> <meta name="google-site-verification" content="JEj_gQr2CPe2QKGw8XdMz0R7VboQIUbX3FlM-lwTq-8" /> <meta name="author" content="Yegor Bugayenko"> <meta name="article:published_time" content="2015-02-12 00:00:00 +0000"> <meta name="og:site_name" content="Yegor Bugayenko"/> <meta name="og:type" content="article" /> <meta name="og:locale" content="en_US" /> <meta name="twitter:account_id" content="4503599630178231" /> <meta name="twitter:creator" content="@yegor256"/> <meta name="twitter:site" content="@yegor256"/> <meta name="twitter:title" property="og:title" content="Code For the User, Not for Yourself"/> <meta name="twitter:description" property="og:description" content="&lt;p&gt;First, no matter what the methodology is, we all write software for our users (a.k.a. customers, project sponsors, end users, or &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/01/26/happy-boss-false-objective.html&quot;&gt;clients&lt;/a&gt;).

Look at it:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-c&quot; data-lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;cp&quot;&gt;#include&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;cpf&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;stdio.h&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;cp&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;main&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;printf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;And I will modify the &lt;code&gt;Makefile&lt;/code&gt; accordingly. I will disable the first test to make sure the build passes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Does my tool work? Yes, it does. Does it count words? Yes, it does for some inputs. Does it have value to my friend. Obviously! He can run it from the command line, and he can pass a file as an input. He will always get number “5” as a result of counting, though. That’s a bummer, but it’s an alpha version. He doesn’t expect it to work perfectly.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, it works, it is backed by tests, and it is properly packaged.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What I just did is a top-down approach to design. First of all, I created something that provides value to my customer. I made sure it also satisfies my technical objectives, like proper unit test coverage and build automation. But the most important goal for me was to make sure my friend received something … and paid me.&lt;/p&gt; "/> <meta name="twitter:url" property="og:url"

Let’s back up a little and think—how can we break this small tool into two parts?</p><p>On first thought, let’s release the tool itself first and build automation and testing next. Is that a good idea? Can we deliver any software without running it first with a test? How can I be sure that it works if I don’t ship tests together with it? What will my friend think about me releasing anything without tests? This would be a total embarrassment.</p><p>Okay, let’s release <code>Makefile</code> first and <code>wc.c</code> next.

This first release will be absolutely pointless, and I won’t get my $100.</p><aside class="quote">Every new increment must add some value to the product as it is perceived by the customer, not by us programmers</aside><p>Now we’re getting to the point of this article. What I’m trying to say is that every new increment must add some value to the product as it is perceived by the customer, not by us programmers. The <code>Makefile</code> is definitely a valuable artifact, but it provides no value to my friend. He doesn’t need it, but I need it.</p><p>Here is what I’m going to do. I’ll release a skeleton of the tool, backed by the tests but with an absolutely dummy implementation. Look at it:</p><figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-c" data-lang="c"><span></span><span class="cp">#include</span> <span class="cpf">&lt;stdio.h&gt;</span><span class="cp"></span>
<span class="kt">int</span> <span class="nf">main</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>

  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure><p>And I will modify the <code>Makefile</code> accordingly. I will disable the first test to make sure the build passes.</p><p>Does my tool work? Yes, it does. Does it count words? Yes, it does for some inputs. Does it have value to my friend. Obviously! He can run it from the command line, and he can pass a file as an input. He will always get number “5” as a result of counting, though. That’s a bummer, but it’s an alpha version. He doesn’t expect it to work perfectly.</p><p>However, it works, it is backed by tests, and it is properly packaged.</p><p>What I just did is a top-down approach to design. First of all, I created something that provides value to my customer. I made sure it also satisfies my technical objectives, like proper unit test coverage and build automation. But the most important goal for me was to make sure my friend received something … and paid me.</p></div></article></div><div class="wrapper"> <related-posts /></div><div class="disqus" role="complementary"><p class="disqus_hint"> Please, use <a href="https://help.disqus.com/commenting/what-html-tags-are-allowed-within-comments">syntax highlighting</a> in your comments, to make them more readable.</p><div id="disqus_thread" class="disqus-thread"> <a>&nbsp;</a></div><script> var disqus_config = function () { this.page.url = document.location.href.split('?')[0].split('#')[0].replace('https://', 'http://'); this.page.identifier = this.page.url; }; (function() { var d = document, s = d.createElement('script'); s.src = '//yegor256.disqus.com/embed.js'; s.setAttribute('data-timestamp', +new Date()); (d.head || d.body).appendChild(s); })(); </script> <noscript><div><p class="red"> JavaScript is disabled in your browser, that's why you can't see comments under this post.</p></div></noscript></div><div class="wrapper"> <footer class="footer"><p> &copy; <span itemscope="" itemprop="copyrightHolder" itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"> <span itemprop="name">Yegor Bugayenko</span> </span> 2014&ndash;<span itemprop="copyrightYear">2018</span></p></footer></div></section><div class="wrapper unprintable" style="text-align:center;margin-top:2em;"> <a href="http://www.sixnines.io/h/3ba1652f"> <img src="//www.sixnines.io/b/3ba1652f?style=flat" alt="sixnines availability badge"/> </a></div><script src="//code.jquery.com/jquery-1.9.0.min.js"></script> <script src="/js/all.js?c998b88f617"></script> <script>var disqus_shortname = 'yegor256';</script> <script id="dsq-count-scr" src="//yegor256.disqus.com/count.js" async="async"></script> <script> (function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){ (i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o), m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m) })(window,document,'script','//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga'); ga('create', 'UA-1963507-32', 'auto'); ga('send', 'pageview'); </script> <script> Cd=document;Cr="&"+Math.random();Cp="&s=1"; Cd.cookie="b=b";if(Cd.cookie)Cp+="&c=1"; Cp+="&t="+(new Date()).getTimezoneOffset(); if(self!=top)Cp+="&f=1"; </script> <script> if(navigator.javaEnabled())Cp+="&j=1"; </script> <script> if(typeof(screen)!='undefined')Cp+="&w="+screen.width+"&h="+ screen.height+"&d="+(screen.colorDepth?screen.colorDepth:screen.pixelDepth); </script> <script> Cd.write("<img src='//c.hit.ua/hit?i=95870&g=0&x=2"+Cp+Cr+ "&r="+escape(Cd.referrer)+"&u="+escape(window.location.href)+ "' border='0' wi"+"dth='1' he"+"ight='1'/>"); </script> <script type="application/ld+json"> { "@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Person", "name": "Yegor Bugayenko", "url": "https://www.yegor256.com", "sameAs": [ "https://www.facebook.com/yegor256", "https://instagram.com/yegor256", "https://www.linkedin.com/in/yegor256", "https://twitter.com/yegor256", "https://github.com/yegor256", "https://www.pinterest.com/yegor256/" ] } </script> </body> </html> <!DOCTYPE html> <html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/WebSite"> <head> <meta charset="utf-8"/> <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_review&quot;&gt;Code reviews&lt;/a&gt; (a.k.a. peer reviews) must be a mandatory practice for every serious software development team. I hope there is no debate about this. Some do pre-merge code reviews, &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/07/21/read-only-master-branch.html&quot;&gt;protecting&lt;/a&gt; their master/development branch from accidental mistakes. Others do post-merge &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/12/18/independent-technical-reviews.html&quot;&gt;regular reviews&lt;/a&gt; to discover bugs and inconsistencies after they are introduced by their authors. Some even do both, reviewing before merges and regularly after. Code reviews are very similar to a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White-box_testing&quot;&gt;white-box testing&lt;/a&gt; technique where a tester looks for defects with full access to the sources of the software. In either case, a code review is a great instrument to increase quality and boost team motivation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, it’s not so simple to do them right. I would even say it’s very easy and comfortable to do them wrong. Most code reviews and reviewers I’ve seen make similar mistakes. That’s why I decided to summarize the four basic principles of a good reviewer as I see them. Hopefully you find them helpful.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;!--more--&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;jb_picture&quot;&gt;&lt;img itemprop=&quot;image&quot; alt=&quot;Main picture&quot; src=&quot;/images/2015/02/kim-jong-un-doing-code-review.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;no-fear&quot;&gt;No Fear&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are a few different fears a serious code reviewer should renounce. The first and most popular is the fear of offending an author of the code. “&lt;em&gt;I’d better close my eyes and pretend I didn’t see her bugs today so tomorrow she will ignore my mistakes&lt;/em&gt;”—This is the kind of attitude this fear produces. Needless to say, it’s counterproductive and degrades &lt;a href=&quot;/2017/04/11/flexibility-equates-lower-quality.html&quot;&gt;code quality&lt;/a&gt; and team morale. Here is my advice: be direct, honest, and straight-forward. If you don’t like the code, you don’t like it. You shouldn’t care how your opinion will be taken by the author of the code.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you do have such feelings toward your colleagues, there is something wrong with the management model. You’re afraid of being rejected by the team for “not being a team player,” which is a label attached to you by the weakest members of the team, not by the project sponsor. The sponsor pays you to produce high-quality software. The sponsor doesn’t care how much your intention to increase quality offends others, who care less. The sponsor wants his money to produce deliverables that can be sold to customers and returned back in profit. The sponsor is not paying you to make friends in the &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/10/06/how-to-be-good-office-slave.html&quot;&gt;office&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The next type of fear sounds like this: “&lt;em&gt;If I reject this code, I will delay the release&lt;/em&gt;” Again, it goes without saying that such an attitude does a significant disservice to the entire project. You will accept the code and close your eyes to what you don’t like in it. The code will go into the next release, and we’ll ship it sooner. You won’t be a bottleneck, and nobody will say that because of that dogmatic code reviewer, we delayed the release and lost some cash. You will be a good team player, right? Wrong!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As I’ve &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/01/15/how-to-cut-corners.html&quot;&gt;mentioned before&lt;/a&gt;, a professional team player understands his or her personal role in a project and doesn’t cover anyone’s ass. If the rejection of &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/11/24/imprisonment-for-irresponsible-coding.html&quot;&gt;bad code&lt;/a&gt; delays the release, that’s the fault of its author. Your professional responsibility is to make this fault visible. That’s how you help the team learn and improve.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I think it’s obvious that the education and improvement of a team first requires getting rid of bad programmers and promoting good ones. Honest and fearless code reviewers help the team learn and improve.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Yet another fear is expressed like this: “&lt;em&gt;I may be wrong and they will laugh me out&lt;/em&gt;” Even worse, they may spot my lack of knowledge. They may see that I don’t know what I’m doing. It would be better to stay quiet and pretend there are no bugs in the code. At least then I wouldn’t embarrass myself with stupid comments. You know that it’s much easier to look smart if you keep your mouth shut, right? Wrong!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The project is not paying you to look good. You’re getting your paychecks not because the team loves you but because you produce deliverables on a daily basis. Your professional responsibility is to do what’s best for the project and ignore everyone’s opinions, including the opinion of your boss. Similar to &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/01/26/happy-boss-false-objective.html&quot;&gt;A Happy Boss Is a False Objective&lt;/a&gt;, I would say that the respect of the team is a false goal. Don’t try to earn respect. Instead, create clean code and respect will come automatically.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Let me reiterate: Don’t be afraid to embarrass yourself by making incorrect and stupid comments about someone’s code. Be loyal to the project, not to the expectations of people around you. They expect you to be smart and bright, but the project expects you to say what you think about the code. So screw their opinions; do the right thing and say what you really think.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;no-compromise&quot;&gt;No Compromise&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Okay, you’ve fearlessly said what you thought about the code and simply rejected it. The branch you were reviewing is not good, and you explained why. You asked its author to refactor here and re-write there. What’s next?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He or she will try to make a deal with you. It’s natural and it’s happening in almost every branch I’m seeing in our teams. The author of the code is also a professional developer, and he also has no fear. So he insists that his implementation approach is right and your ideas are wrong. What should a professional code reviewer do in this case?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The worst thing (as in any conflict resolution) is a compromise. This is what ruins quality faster than bad code. A compromise is a conflict resolution technique for which both parties agree not to get what they wanted just for the sake of ceasing the conflict. In other words, “&lt;em&gt;Let’s make peace just to stop fighting&lt;/em&gt;” It’s the worst approach ever.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Instead of a lousy compromise, there are three professional exits from a fight over a piece of code:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;You’re right; I take my comments back!&lt;/em&gt;” This may happen, and it should happen very often. You should be ready to admit your mistakes. You didn’t like the code, but its author explained to you its benefits, and you accepted the logic—not because you want to stop fighting with him but because you really understood the logic and accepted it. Willingness to say, “I’m wrong,” is the first sign of a mature and serious developer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;I will never accept this, period!&lt;/em&gt;” Some code deserves that, and there is nothing wrong with resolving a conflict this way. The opponent may accept the situation and re-write everything. And learn something too.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;Let’s do what the architect says!&lt;/em&gt;” In every project, there is a &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/10/12/who-is-software-architect.html&quot;&gt;software architect&lt;/a&gt; who makes final decisions. Appeal to his opinion and get his final decision. Invite him into the discussion, and ask him to take one side in the conflict. Once he tells you that you’re wrong, accept the decision and try to learn from it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thus, either stand strong on your position and fight for it or admit that you’re wrong. One way or the other. But don’t make a compromise!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Don’t get me wrong; it’s not about being stubborn and holding your cards no matter how bad they are. Be flexible and learn on the spot. Your position may and should change during the negotiation, but don’t accept anything that you don’t like. You can exit the conflict either by being fully convinced that the opponent is right or when the architect says so. Nothing in between.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;no-bullshit&quot;&gt;No Bullshit&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Again, you fearlessly said that a method should be designed differently. Your opponent, the author of the code, replies that he doesn’t think so. You take a look again and decide to stand behind your position. You still think you’re right, and you’re not going to make a compromise. Now what? It’s too early to call an architect, so try to convince your opponent.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In most cases, convincing is teaching. You know something that he doesn’t know. That’s why he created that method the way you don’t like. One of you needs some additional education. Here is an opportunity for you to be a teacher of your colleague. To be an effective teacher, you need to show proof. You need to ground your logic and make sure he understands and accepts it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Be ready to show links, articles, books, reports, examples, etc. Just “&lt;em&gt;I know this because I’ve been writing Java for 15 years&lt;/em&gt;” is not enough. Moreover, this type of argument only makes you less convincing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you don’t have enough convincing proof, think again—maybe you are wrong.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Also, remember that it’s your job to prove that the code you’re reviewing is bad. The author of the code should not prove anything. His code is great by default. The job of the reviewer is to show why and how that’s actually not the case. In other words, you’re the plaintiff and he is the defender. Not the other way around.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;no-offense&quot;&gt;No Offense&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is the last and most difficult principle to follow. No matter how bad the code is and how stubborn your opponent is, you must remain professional. To be honest, I find this very difficult sometimes. At &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zerocracy.com&quot;&gt;Zerocracy&lt;/a&gt;, we’re working in distributed teams and hire a few new people every week. Some of them, despite our &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/10/29/how-much-do-you-cost.html&quot;&gt;screening criteria&lt;/a&gt;, appear to be rather &lt;span class=&quot;strike&quot;&gt;stupid&lt;/span&gt; difficult to deal with.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I encountered a funny situation about a year ago when a new guy was supposed to create a small (20 to 30 lines of code) new feature in an existing Java library. He sent me a pull request (I was a code reviewer) after he put in a few hundred lines of code. That code was absolute garbage and obviously not written by him. I immediately understood that he found it somewhere and copied it. But what could I do? How could I reject it without saying his attitude was unacceptable for a professional developer? I had to spend some time objectively blaming his code for its style, its design, etc. I had to make many serious comments in order to show him that to fix it all, he should delete the garbage and re-write it from scratch. I never saw him again after that task.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;My point is that it’s easy to be professional when you’re dealing with professionals. Unfortunately, that’s not always the case. But no matter how bad the code in front of you is, be patient and convincing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;What do you feel when your pull request is rejected and a lot of &amp;quot;re-work&amp;quot; is required? &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/sociotech?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#sociotech&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;--- Yegor Bugayenko (@yegor256) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/yegor256/status/1013385039701250048?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;July 1, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt; " /> <meta name="keywords" content="next, path, output, content, previous, url, relative_path, id, collection, excerpt, draft, categories, layout, title, date, tags, description, keywords, translated, image, slug, ext" /> <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1"/> <meta name="google-site-verification" content="JEj_gQr2CPe2QKGw8XdMz0R7VboQIUbX3FlM-lwTq-8" /> <meta name="author" content="Yegor Bugayenko"> <meta name="article:published_time" content="2015-02-09 00:00:00 +0000"> <meta name="og:site_name" content="Yegor Bugayenko"/> <meta name="og:type" content="article" /> <meta name="og:locale" content="en_US" /> <meta name="twitter:account_id" content="4503599630178231" /> <meta name="twitter:creator" content="@yegor256"/> <meta name="twitter:site" content="@yegor256"/> <meta name="twitter:title" property="og:title" content="Four NOs of a Serious Code Reviewer"/> <meta name="twitter:description" property="og:description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_review&quot;&gt;Code reviews&lt;/a&gt; (a.k.a. peer reviews) must be a mandatory practice for every serious software development team.

So he insists that his implementation approach is right and your ideas are wrong. What should a professional code reviewer do in this case?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The worst thing (as in any conflict resolution) is a compromise. This is what ruins quality faster than bad code. A compromise is a conflict resolution technique for which both parties agree not to get what they wanted just for the sake of ceasing the conflict. In other words, “&lt;em&gt;Let’s make peace just to stop fighting&lt;/em&gt;” It’s the worst approach ever.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Instead of a lousy compromise, there are three professional exits from a fight over a piece of code:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;You’re right; I take my comments back!&lt;/em&gt;” This may happen, and it should happen very often. You should be ready to admit your mistakes. You didn’t like the code, but its author explained to you its benefits, and you accepted the logic—not because you want to stop fighting with him but because you really understood the logic and accepted it. Willingness to say, “I’m wrong,” is the first sign of a mature and serious developer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;I will never accept this, period!&lt;/em&gt;” Some code deserves that, and there is nothing wrong with resolving a conflict this way. The opponent may accept the situation and re-write everything. And learn something too.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;Let’s do what the architect says!&lt;/em&gt;” In every project, there is a &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/10/12/who-is-software-architect.html&quot;&gt;software architect&lt;/a&gt; who makes final decisions. Appeal to his opinion and get his final decision. Invite him into the discussion, and ask him to take one side in the conflict. Once he tells you that you’re wrong, accept the decision and try to learn from it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thus, either stand strong on your position and fight for it or admit that you’re wrong. One way or the other. But don’t make a compromise!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Don’t get me wrong; it’s not about being stubborn and holding your cards no matter how bad they are. Be flexible and learn on the spot. Your position may and should change during the negotiation, but don’t accept anything that you don’t like. You can exit the conflict either by being fully convinced that the opponent is right or when the architect says so. Nothing in between.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;no-bullshit&quot;&gt;No Bullshit&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Again, you fearlessly said that a method should be designed differently. Your opponent, the author of the code, replies that he doesn’t think so. You take a look again and decide to stand behind your position. You still think you’re right, and you’re not going to make a compromise. Now what? It’s too early to call an architect, so try to convince your opponent.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In most cases, convincing is teaching. You know something that he doesn’t know. That’s why he created that method the way you don’t like. One of you needs some additional education. Here is an opportunity for you to be a teacher of your colleague. To be an effective teacher, you need to show proof. You need to ground your logic and make sure he understands and accepts it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Be ready to show links, articles, books, reports, examples, etc. Just “&lt;em&gt;I know this because I’ve been writing Java for 15 years&lt;/em&gt;” is not enough. Moreover, this type of argument only makes you less convincing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you don’t have enough convincing proof, think again—maybe you are wrong.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Also, remember that it’s your job to prove that the code you’re reviewing is bad. The author of the code should not prove anything. His code is great by default. The job of the reviewer is to show why and how that’s actually not the case. In other words, you’re the plaintiff and he is the defender. Not the other way around.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;no-offense&quot;&gt;No Offense&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is the last and most difficult principle to follow. No matter how bad the code is and how stubborn your opponent is, you must remain professional. To be honest, I find this very difficult sometimes. At &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zerocracy.com&quot;&gt;Zerocracy&lt;/a&gt;, we’re working in distributed teams and hire a few new people every week. Some of them, despite our &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/10/29/how-much-do-you-cost.html&quot;&gt;screening criteria&lt;/a&gt;, appear to be rather &lt;span class=&quot;strike&quot;&gt;stupid&lt;/span&gt; difficult to deal with.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I encountered a funny situation about a year ago when a new guy was supposed to create a small (20 to 30 lines of code) new feature in an existing Java library. He sent me a pull request (I was a code reviewer) after he put in a few hundred lines of code. That code was absolute garbage and obviously not written by him. I immediately understood that he found it somewhere and copied it. But what could I do? How could I reject it without saying his attitude was unacceptable for a professional developer? I had to spend some time objectively blaming his code for its style, its design, etc. I had to make many serious comments in order to show him that to fix it all, he should delete the garbage and re-write it from scratch. I never saw him again after that task.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;My point is that it’s easy to be professional when you’re dealing with professionals. Unfortunately, that’s not always the case. But no matter how bad the code in front of you is, be patient and convincing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;What do you feel when your pull request is rejected and a lot of &amp;quot;re-work&amp;quot; is required? &lt;a

href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_review">Code reviews</a> (a.k.a. peer reviews) must be a mandatory practice for every serious software development team. I hope there is no debate about this. Some do pre-merge code reviews, <a href="/2014/07/21/read-only-master-branch.html">protecting</a> their master/development branch from accidental mistakes. Others do post-merge <a href="/2014/12/18/independent-technical-reviews.html">regular reviews</a> to discover bugs and inconsistencies after they are introduced by their authors. Some even do both, reviewing before merges and regularly after. Code reviews are very similar to a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White-box_testing">white-box testing</a> technique where a tester looks for defects with full access to the sources of the software. In either case, a code review is a great instrument to increase quality and boost team motivation.</p><p>However, it’s not so simple to do them right. I would even say it’s very easy and comfortable to do them wrong. Most code reviews and reviewers I’ve seen make similar mistakes. That’s why I decided to summarize the four basic principles of a good reviewer as I see them. Hopefully you find them helpful.</p><figure class="jb_picture"><img itemprop="image" alt="Main picture" src="/images/2015/02/kim-jong-un-doing-code-review.png" /></figure><h2 id="no-fear">No Fear</h2><p>There are a few different fears a serious code reviewer should renounce. The first and most popular is the fear of offending an author of the code. “<em>I’d better close my eyes and pretend I didn’t see her bugs today so tomorrow she will ignore my mistakes</em>”—This is the kind of attitude this fear produces. Needless to say, it’s counterproductive and degrades <a href="/2017/04/11/flexibility-equates-lower-quality.html">code quality</a> and team morale. Here is my advice: be direct, honest, and straight-forward. If you don’t like the code, you don’t like it. You shouldn’t care how your opinion will be taken by the author of the code.</p><p>If you do have such feelings toward your colleagues, there is something wrong with the management model. You’re afraid of being rejected by the team for “not being a team player,” which is a label attached to you by the weakest members of the team, not by the project sponsor. The sponsor pays you to produce high-quality software. The sponsor doesn’t care how much your intention to increase quality offends others, who care less. The sponsor wants his money to produce deliverables that can be sold to customers and returned back in profit. The sponsor is not paying you to make friends in the <a href="/2015/10/06/how-to-be-good-office-slave.html">office</a>.</p><p>The next type of fear sounds like this: “<em>If I reject this code, I will delay the release</em>” Again, it goes without saying that such an attitude does a significant disservice to the entire project. You will accept the code and close your eyes to what you don’t like in it. The code will go into the next release, and we’ll ship it sooner. You won’t be a bottleneck, and nobody will say that because of that dogmatic code reviewer, we delayed the release and lost some cash. You will be a good team player, right? Wrong!</p><p>As I’ve <a href="/2015/01/15/how-to-cut-corners.html">mentioned before</a>, a professional team player understands his or her personal role in a project and doesn’t cover anyone’s ass. If the rejection of <a href="/2015/11/24/imprisonment-for-irresponsible-coding.html">bad code</a> delays the release, that’s the fault of its author. Your professional responsibility is to make this fault visible. That’s how you help the team learn and improve.</p><p>I think it’s obvious that the education and improvement of a team first requires getting rid of bad programmers and promoting good ones. Honest and fearless code reviewers help the team learn and improve.</p><p>Yet another fear is expressed like this: “<em>I may be wrong and they will laugh me out</em>” Even worse, they may spot my lack of knowledge. They may see that I don’t know what I’m doing. It would be better to stay quiet and pretend there are no bugs in the code. At least then I wouldn’t embarrass myself with stupid comments. You know that it’s much easier to look smart if you keep your mouth shut, right? Wrong!</p><p>The project is not paying you to look good. You’re getting your paychecks not because the team loves you but because you produce deliverables on a daily basis. Your professional responsibility is to do what’s best for the project and ignore everyone’s opinions, including the opinion of your boss. Similar to <a href="/2015/01/26/happy-boss-false-objective.html">A Happy Boss Is a False Objective</a>, I would say that the respect of the team is a false goal. Don’t try to earn respect. Instead, create clean code and respect will come automatically.</p><p>Let me reiterate: Don’t be afraid to embarrass yourself by making incorrect and stupid comments about someone’s code. Be loyal to the project, not to the expectations of people around you. They expect you to be smart and bright, but the project expects you to say what you think about the code. So screw their opinions; do the right thing and say what you really think.</p><h2 id="no-compromise">No Compromise</h2><p>Okay, you’ve fearlessly said what you thought about the code and simply rejected it. The branch you were reviewing is not good, and you explained why. You asked its author to refactor here and re-write there. What’s next?</p><p>He or she will try to make a deal with you. It’s natural and it’s happening in almost every branch I’m seeing in our teams. The author of the code is also a professional developer, and he also has no fear. So he insists that his implementation approach is right and your ideas are wrong. What should a professional code reviewer do in this case?</p><p>The worst thing (as in any conflict resolution) is a compromise. This is what ruins quality faster than bad code. A compromise is a conflict resolution technique for which both parties agree not to get what they wanted just for the sake of ceasing the conflict. In other words, “<em>Let’s make peace just to stop fighting</em>” It’s the worst approach ever.</p><p>Instead of a lousy compromise, there are three professional exits from a fight over a piece of code:</p><ul> <li><p>“<em>You’re right; I take my comments back!</em>” This may happen, and it should happen very often. You should be ready to admit your mistakes. You didn’t like the code, but its author explained to you its benefits, and you accepted the logic—not because you want to stop fighting with him but because you really understood the logic and accepted it. Willingness to say, “I’m wrong,” is the first sign of a mature and serious developer.</p></li> <li><p>“<em>I will never accept this, period!</em>” Some code deserves that, and there is nothing wrong with resolving a conflict this way. The opponent may accept the situation and re-write everything. And learn something too.</p></li> <li><p>“<em>Let’s do what the architect says!</em>” In every project, there is a <a href="/2014/10/12/who-is-software-architect.html">software architect</a> who makes final decisions. Appeal to his opinion and get his final decision. Invite him into the discussion, and ask him to take one side in the conflict. Once he tells you that you’re wrong, accept the decision and try to learn from it.</p></li></ul><p>Thus, either stand strong on your position and fight for it or admit that you’re wrong. One way or the other. But don’t make a compromise!</p><p>Don’t get me wrong; it’s not about being stubborn and holding your cards no matter how bad they are. Be flexible and learn on the spot.

I hope there is no debate about this. Some do pre-merge code reviews, <a href="/2014/07/21/read-only-master-branch.html">protecting</a> their master/development branch from accidental mistakes. Others do post-merge <a href="/2014/12/18/independent-technical-reviews.html">regular reviews</a> to discover bugs and inconsistencies after they are introduced by their authors. Some even do both, reviewing before merges and regularly after. Code reviews are very similar to a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White-box_testing">white-box testing</a> technique where a tester looks for defects with full access to the sources of the software. In either case, a code review is a great instrument to increase quality and boost team motivation.</p><p>However, it’s not so simple to do them right. I would even say it’s very easy and comfortable to do them wrong. Most code reviews and reviewers I’ve seen make similar mistakes. That’s why I decided to summarize the four basic principles of a good reviewer as I see them. Hopefully you find them helpful.</p><figure class="jb_picture"><img itemprop="image" alt="Main picture" src="/images/2015/02/kim-jong-un-doing-code-review.png" /></figure><h2 id="no-fear">No Fear</h2><p>There are a few different fears a serious code reviewer should renounce. The first and most popular is the fear of offending an author of the code. “<em>I’d better close my eyes and pretend I didn’t see her bugs today so tomorrow she will ignore my mistakes</em>”—This is the kind of attitude this fear produces. Needless to say, it’s counterproductive and degrades <a href="/2017/04/11/flexibility-equates-lower-quality.html">code quality</a> and team morale. Here is my advice: be direct, honest, and straight-forward. If you don’t like the code, you don’t like it. You shouldn’t care how your opinion will be taken by the author of the code.</p><p>If you do have such feelings toward your colleagues, there is something wrong with the management model. You’re afraid of being rejected by the team for “not being a team player,” which is a label attached to you by the weakest members of the team, not by the project sponsor. The sponsor pays you to produce high-quality software. The sponsor doesn’t care how much your intention to increase quality offends others, who care less. The sponsor wants his money to produce deliverables that can be sold to customers and returned back in profit. The sponsor is not paying you to make friends in the <a href="/2015/10/06/how-to-be-good-office-slave.html">office</a>.</p><p>The next type of fear sounds like this: “<em>If I reject this code, I will delay the release</em>” Again, it goes without saying that such an attitude does a significant disservice to the entire project. You will accept the code and close your eyes to what you don’t like in it. The code will go into the next release, and we’ll ship it sooner. You won’t be a bottleneck, and nobody will say that because of that dogmatic code reviewer, we delayed the release and lost some cash. You will be a good team player, right? Wrong!</p><p>As I’ve <a href="/2015/01/15/how-to-cut-corners.html">mentioned before</a>, a professional team player understands his or her personal role in a project and doesn’t cover anyone’s ass. If the rejection of <a href="/2015/11/24/imprisonment-for-irresponsible-coding.html">bad code</a> delays the release, that’s the fault of its author. Your professional responsibility is to make this fault visible. That’s how you help the team learn and improve.</p><p>I think it’s obvious that the education and improvement of a team first requires getting rid of bad programmers and promoting good ones. Honest and fearless code reviewers help the team learn and improve.</p><p>Yet another fear is expressed like this: “<em>I may be wrong and they will laugh me out</em>” Even worse, they may spot my lack of knowledge. They may see that I don’t know what I’m doing. It would be better to stay quiet and pretend there are no bugs in the code. At least then I wouldn’t embarrass myself with stupid comments. You know that it’s much easier to look smart if you keep your mouth shut, right? Wrong!</p><p>The project is not paying you to look good. You’re getting your paychecks not because the team loves you but because you produce deliverables on a daily basis. Your professional responsibility is to do what’s best for the project and ignore everyone’s opinions, including the opinion of your boss. Similar to <a href="/2015/01/26/happy-boss-false-objective.html">A Happy Boss Is a False Objective</a>, I would say that the respect of the team is a false goal. Don’t try to earn respect. Instead, create clean code and respect will come automatically.</p><p>Let me reiterate: Don’t be afraid to embarrass yourself by making incorrect and stupid comments about someone’s code. Be loyal to the project, not to the expectations of people around you. They expect you to be smart and bright, but the project expects you to say what you think about the code. So screw their opinions; do the right thing and say what you really think.</p><h2 id="no-compromise">No Compromise</h2><p>Okay, you’ve fearlessly said what you thought about the code and simply rejected it. The branch you were reviewing is not good, and you explained why. You asked its author to refactor here and re-write there. What’s next?</p><p>He or she will try to make a deal with you. It’s natural and it’s happening in almost every branch I’m seeing in our teams. The author of the code is also a professional developer, and he also has no fear. So he insists that his implementation approach is right and your ideas are wrong. What should a professional code reviewer do in this case?</p><p>The worst thing (as in any conflict resolution) is a compromise. This is what ruins quality faster than bad code. A compromise is a conflict resolution technique for which both parties agree not to get what they wanted just for the sake of ceasing the conflict. In other words, “<em>Let’s make peace just to stop fighting</em>” It’s the worst approach ever.</p><p>Instead of a lousy compromise, there are three professional exits from a fight over a piece of code:</p><ul> <li><p>“<em>You’re right; I take my comments back!</em>” This may happen, and it should happen very often. You should be ready to admit your mistakes. You didn’t like the code, but its author explained to you its benefits, and you accepted the logic—not because you want to stop fighting with him but because you really understood the logic and accepted it. Willingness to say, “I’m wrong,” is the first sign of a mature and serious developer.</p></li> <li><p>“<em>I will never accept this, period!</em>” Some code deserves that, and there is nothing wrong with resolving a conflict this way. The opponent may accept the situation and re-write everything. And learn something too.</p></li> <li><p>“<em>Let’s do what the architect says!</em>” In every project, there is a <a href="/2014/10/12/who-is-software-architect.html">software architect</a> who makes final decisions. Appeal to his opinion and get his final decision. Invite him into the discussion, and ask him to take one side in the conflict. Once he tells you that you’re wrong, accept the decision and try to learn from it.</p></li></ul><p>Thus, either stand strong on your position and fight for it or admit that you’re wrong. One way or the other. But don’t make a compromise!</p><p>Don’t get me wrong; it’s not about being stubborn and holding your cards no matter how bad they are. Be flexible and learn on the spot. Your position may and should change during the negotiation, but don’t accept anything that you don’t like. You can exit the conflict either by being fully convinced that the opponent is right or when the architect says so. Nothing in between.</p><h2 id="no-bullshit">No Bullshit</h2><p>Again, you fearlessly said that a method should be designed differently. Your opponent, the author of the code, replies that he doesn’t think so. You take a look again and decide to stand behind your position. You still think you’re right, and you’re not going to make a compromise. Now what? It’s too early to call an architect, so try to convince your opponent.</p><p>In most cases, convincing is teaching. You know something that he doesn’t know. That’s why he created that method the way you don’t like. One of you needs some additional education. Here is an opportunity for you to be a teacher of your colleague. To be an effective teacher, you need to show proof. You need to ground your logic and make sure he understands and accepts it.</p><p>Be ready to show links, articles, books, reports, examples, etc. Just “<em>I know this because I’ve been writing Java for 15 years</em>” is not enough. Moreover, this type of argument only makes you less convincing.</p><p>If you don’t have enough convincing proof, think again—maybe you are wrong.</p><p>Also, remember that it’s your job to prove that the code you’re reviewing is bad. The author of the code should not prove anything. His code is great by default. The job of the reviewer is to show why and how that’s actually not the case. In other words, you’re the plaintiff and he is the defender. Not the other way around.</p><h2 id="no-offense">No Offense</h2><p>This is the last and most difficult principle to follow. No matter how bad the code is and how stubborn your opponent is, you must remain professional. To be honest, I find this very difficult sometimes. At <a href="https://www.zerocracy.com">Zerocracy</a>, we’re working in distributed teams and hire a few new people every week. Some of them, despite our <a href="/2014/10/29/how-much-do-you-cost.html">screening criteria</a>, appear to be rather <span class="strike">stupid</span> difficult to deal with.</p><p>I encountered a funny situation about a year ago when a new guy was supposed to create a small (20 to 30 lines of code) new feature in an existing Java library. He sent me a pull request (I was a code reviewer) after he put in a few hundred lines of code. That code was absolute garbage and obviously not written by him. I immediately understood that he found it somewhere and copied it. But what could I do? How could I reject it without saying his attitude was unacceptable for a professional developer? I had to spend some time objectively blaming his code for its style, its design, etc. I had to make many serious comments in order to show him that to fix it all, he should delete the garbage and re-write it from scratch. I never saw him again after that task.</p><p>My point is that it’s easy to be professional when you’re dealing with professionals. Unfortunately, that’s not always the case. But no matter how bad the code in front of you is, be patient and convincing.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">What do you feel when your pull request is rejected and a lot of &quot;re-work&quot; is required? <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/sociotech?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#sociotech</a></p>--- Yegor Bugayenko (@yegor256) <a href="https://twitter.com/yegor256/status/1013385039701250048?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 1, 2018</a></blockquote> <script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div></article></div><div class="wrapper"> <related-posts /></div><div class="disqus" role="complementary"><p class="disqus_hint"> Please, use <a href="https://help.disqus.com/commenting/what-html-tags-are-allowed-within-comments">syntax highlighting</a> in your comments, to make them more readable.</p><div id="disqus_thread" class="disqus-thread"> <a>&nbsp;</a></div><script> var disqus_config = function () { this.page.url = document.location.href.split('?')[0].split('#')[0].replace('https://', 'http://'); this.page.identifier = this.page.url; }; (function() { var d = document, s = d.createElement('script'); s.src = '//yegor256.disqus.com/embed.js'; s.setAttribute('data-timestamp', +new Date()); (d.head || d.body).appendChild(s); })(); </script> <noscript><div><p class="red"> JavaScript is disabled in your browser, that's why you can't see comments under this post.</p></div></noscript></div><div class="wrapper"> <footer class="footer"><p> &copy; <span itemscope="" itemprop="copyrightHolder" itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"> <span itemprop="name">Yegor Bugayenko</span> </span> 2014&ndash;<span itemprop="copyrightYear">2018</span></p></footer></div></section><div class="wrapper unprintable" style="text-align:center;margin-top:2em;"> <a href="http://www.sixnines.io/h/3ba1652f"> <img src="//www.sixnines.io/b/3ba1652f?style=flat" alt="sixnines availability badge"/> </a></div><script src="//code.jquery.com/jquery-1.9.0.min.js"></script> <script src="/js/all.js?c998b88f617"></script> <script>var disqus_shortname = 'yegor256';</script> <script id="dsq-count-scr" src="//yegor256.disqus.com/count.js" async="async"></script> <script> (function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){ (i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o), m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m) })(window,document,'script','//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga'); ga('create', 'UA-1963507-32', 'auto'); ga('send', 'pageview'); </script> <script> Cd=document;Cr="&"+Math.random();Cp="&s=1"; Cd.cookie="b=b";if(Cd.cookie)Cp+="&c=1"; Cp+="&t="+(new Date()).getTimezoneOffset(); if(self!=top)Cp+="&f=1"; </script> <script> if(navigator.javaEnabled())Cp+="&j=1"; </script> <script> if(typeof(screen)!='undefined')Cp+="&w="+screen.width+"&h="+ screen.height+"&d="+(screen.colorDepth?screen.colorDepth:screen.pixelDepth); </script> <script> Cd.write("<img src='//c.hit.ua/hit?i=95870&g=0&x=2"+Cp+Cr+ "&r="+escape(Cd.referrer)+"&u="+escape(window.location.href)+ "' border='0' wi"+"dth='1' he"+"ight='1'/>"); </script> <script type="application/ld+json"> { "@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Person", "name": "Yegor Bugayenko", "url": "https://www.yegor256.com", "sameAs": [ "https://www.facebook.com/yegor256", "https://instagram.com/yegor256", "https://www.linkedin.com/in/yegor256", "https://twitter.com/yegor256", "https://github.com/yegor256", "https://www.pinterest.com/yegor256/" ] } </script> </body> </html> <!DOCTYPE html> <html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/WebSite"> <head> <meta charset="utf-8"/> <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;We all have bosses.

It is obvious that a good employee/contractor is one who makes his boss/customer happy. But only a bad employee works toward this goal. Trying to make your boss happy is a false target that, if pursued, ruins the project. A professional employee works for the project, not for the boss.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;!--more--&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;jb_picture&quot;&gt;&lt;img itemprop=&quot;image&quot; alt=&quot;The Million Dollar Hotel (2000) by Wim Wenders&quot; src=&quot;/images/2015/01/the-million-dollar-hotel.png&quot; longdesc=&quot;#a14f03e8&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption id=&quot;a14f03e8&quot;&gt;The Million Dollar Hotel (2000) by Wim Wenders&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;We all work on &lt;strong&gt;projects&lt;/strong&gt; as developers, designers, programmers, &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/09/22/micromanagement.html&quot;&gt;managers&lt;/a&gt;, testers, you name it. The boss is also a member of the project. More formally, he or she is a &lt;strong&gt;stakeholder&lt;/strong&gt;, same as every one of us. Each stakeholder has his own &lt;strong&gt;needs&lt;/strong&gt; for the project: 1) Jeff, the developer, wants to learn Scala and collect his paychecks every two weeks; 2) Sally, the product owner, wants to attend an expo in Paris and also collect her paychecks; 3) Bob, the CTO, wants to raise round A funding and collect a big paycheck; etc.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The project has its own &lt;strong&gt;objectives&lt;/strong&gt;, to achieve 1 million downloads in less than six months and under $300,000, for example. This is what the project works for. This is what all of us are here for.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Our personal needs may be fully satisfied while we’re all working toward this goal, or some of them may be sacrificed. I mean all of us, including the boss, whoever he or she is, either a CTO, a co-founder, a &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/05/24/who-is-project-manager.html&quot;&gt;project manager&lt;/a&gt;, or a team lead.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The project is the source of our checks. Not the CFO.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;A true professional team player feels himself equal to all other members of the project, no matter how high they are in the hierarchy.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;The CFO is a stakeholder, like everyone else. The project gives him more power than others because it’s necessary for the whole mechanism to work properly. Every project member has his or her own &lt;strong&gt;roles and responsibilities&lt;/strong&gt;. I write code; the CFO writes checks. I eat at McDonald’s; he drives a Jaguar. We have different needs, and we both agreed that the project would satisfy them. Otherwise we wouldn’t be here, right?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We’re all parts of a mechanism called a “project,” which works according to the rules and principles of &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/05/24/who-is-project-manager.html&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;project management&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; whether we are aware of them or not. Whether we have a &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/05/24/who-is-project-manager.html&quot;&gt;project manager&lt;/a&gt; or not. Even if we violate all of them and manage ourselves in total chaos, we still have a scope, &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/06/02/how-to-estimate-software-cost.html&quot;&gt;cost&lt;/a&gt;, schedule, and all other attributes of project management.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A professional and savvy boss understands that his role in the mechanism is to clearly define project objectives and make sure everybody’s needs are aligned with those objectives. In a properly managed and organized project, everybody sees and feels how his or her personal needs are satisfied when the project &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/02/12/top-down-design.html&quot;&gt;achieves&lt;/a&gt; its objectives: Jeff learns Scala, Sally sees Paris, and Bob buys a new house.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, if Jeff wants to learn Scala and we’re developing an iOS application, that is a problem for the boss to resolve. Either convince Jeff to fall in love with Swift (I doubt that’s possible) or replace him with someone who is already in love with it. It’s clear that a professional boss will resort to such a tragic act as &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/09/16/how-to-fire-someone-right.html&quot;&gt;firing&lt;/a&gt; Jeff not because of his personal feelings towards Jeff but because they are both working toward the project objectives. Jeff and the boss will both understand that Jeff’s need to learn Scala is not aligned with the objective of the project.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is the CTO’s responsibility to do something about Jeff when his personal needs become misaligned with the objectives of the project that is paying his salary. A professional CEO understands that and always acts in the best interest of the project, not of himself or anyone else personally.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I believe a professional team player does two things: &lt;strong&gt;obeys and resists&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;First, you have to understand that the boss is here in order to help you organize your time, your tasks, your communications, your plans, etc. He knows more about the project and uses that information to help you do your job. Your real boss is the project; the boss you interact with is just a hired manager who translates project objectives into plans, instructions, schedules, etc.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Being a professional team player requires a constant readiness to resist each and every instruction.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;This boss is your colleague who does management while you’re writing code. You’re both equal. You and he are in the same boat. Your functions are different than his; that’s all. You’re not working &lt;em&gt;for&lt;/em&gt; him but &lt;em&gt;with&lt;/em&gt; him on a project. A true professional team player feels himself equal to all other members of the project, no matter how high they are in the hierarchy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At the same time, he strictly follows the process and obeys all project rules and instructions, not because he is afraid of being fired but because he wants the project to succeed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Second, being a professional team player requires a constant readiness to resist each and every instruction if you feel it contradicts the project objectives. A true professional doesn’t work for a boss. He doesn’t want to make the boss happy. He actually doesn’t care whether the boss is happy or not. He knows that the real boss is the project and tries to make the project successful and … happy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A true professional always works for himself. Jeff wants to learn Scala and earn a certain amount of cash. He joined the project in order to satisfy these needs. If the project fails, Jeff won’t get the money and won’t fully learn Scala. So if the boss tells Jeff to do something that may jeopardize the project’s success, will Jeff do it? Does he care about disappointing the boss? Absolutely not. All he cares about is the project’s success, which translates to his personal success.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thus, making your boss happy is a goal for the immature, fearsome, lazy, and weak. Making your project successful is an objective for professional, strong, mature, and brave team players.&lt;/p&gt; " /> <meta name="keywords" content="next, path, output, content, previous, url, relative_path, id, collection, excerpt, draft, categories, layout, title, date, tags, description, keywords, image, jb_picture, slug, ext" /> <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1"/> <meta name="google-site-verification" content="JEj_gQr2CPe2QKGw8XdMz0R7VboQIUbX3FlM-lwTq-8" /> <meta name="author" content="Yegor Bugayenko"> <meta name="article:published_time" content="2015-01-26 00:00:00 +0000"> <meta name="og:site_name" content="Yegor Bugayenko"/> <meta name="og:type" content="article" /> <meta name="og:locale" content="en_US" /> <meta name="twitter:account_id" content="4503599630178231" /> <meta name="twitter:creator" content="@yegor256"/> <meta name="twitter:site" content="@yegor256"/> <meta name="twitter:title" property="og:title" content="Making Your Boss Happy Is a False Objective"/> <meta name="twitter:description" property="og:description" content="&lt;p&gt;We all have bosses.

Each stakeholder has his own &lt;strong&gt;needs&lt;/strong&gt; for the project: 1) Jeff, the developer, wants to learn Scala and collect his paychecks every two weeks; 2) Sally, the product owner, wants to attend an expo in Paris and also collect her paychecks; 3) Bob, the CTO, wants to raise round A funding and collect a big paycheck; etc.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The project has its own &lt;strong&gt;objectives&lt;/strong&gt;, to achieve 1 million downloads in less than six months and under $300,000, for example. This is what the project works for. This is what all of us are here for.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Our personal needs may be fully satisfied while we’re all working toward this goal, or some of them may be sacrificed. I mean all of us, including the boss, whoever he or she is, either a CTO, a co-founder, a &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/05/24/who-is-project-manager.html&quot;&gt;project manager&lt;/a&gt;, or a team lead.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The project is the source of our checks. Not the CFO.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;A true professional team player feels himself equal to all other members of the project, no matter how high they are in the hierarchy.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;The CFO is a stakeholder, like everyone else. The project gives him more power than others because it’s necessary for the whole mechanism to work properly. Every project member has his or her own &lt;strong&gt;roles and responsibilities&lt;/strong&gt;. I write code; the CFO writes checks. I eat at McDonald’s; he drives a Jaguar. We have different needs, and we both agreed that the project would satisfy them. Otherwise we wouldn’t be here, right?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We’re all parts of a mechanism called a “project,” which works according to the rules and principles of &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/05/24/who-is-project-manager.html&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;project management&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; whether we are aware of them or not. Whether we have a &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/05/24/who-is-project-manager.html&quot;&gt;project manager&lt;/a&gt; or not. Even if we violate all of them and manage ourselves in total chaos, we still have a scope, &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/06/02/how-to-estimate-software-cost.html&quot;&gt;cost&lt;/a&gt;, schedule, and all other attributes of project management.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A professional and savvy boss understands that his role in the mechanism is to clearly define project objectives and make sure everybody’s needs are aligned with those objectives. In a properly managed and organized project, everybody sees and feels how his or her personal needs are satisfied when the project &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/02/12/top-down-design.html&quot;&gt;achieves&lt;/a&gt; its objectives: Jeff learns Scala, Sally sees Paris, and Bob buys a new house.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, if Jeff wants to learn Scala and we’re developing an iOS application, that is a problem for the boss to resolve. Either convince Jeff to fall in love with Swift (I doubt that’s possible) or replace him with someone who is already in love with it. It’s clear that a professional boss will resort to such a tragic act as &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/09/16/how-to-fire-someone-right.html&quot;&gt;firing&lt;/a&gt; Jeff not because of his personal feelings towards Jeff but because they are both working toward the project objectives. Jeff and the boss will both understand that Jeff’s need to learn Scala is not aligned with the objective of the project.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is the CTO’s responsibility to do something about Jeff when his personal needs become misaligned with the objectives of the project that is paying his salary. A professional CEO understands that and always acts in the best interest of the project, not of himself or anyone else personally.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I believe a professional team player does two things: &lt;strong&gt;obeys and resists&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;First, you have to understand that the boss is here in order to help you organize your time, your tasks, your communications, your plans, etc. He knows more about the project and uses that information to help you do your job. Your real boss is the project; the boss you interact with is just a hired manager who translates project objectives into plans, instructions, schedules, etc.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Being a professional team player requires a constant readiness to resist each and every instruction.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;This boss is your colleague who does management while you’re writing code. You’re both equal. You and he are in the same boat. Your functions are different than his; that’s all. You’re not working &lt;em&gt;for&lt;/em&gt; him but &lt;em&gt;with&lt;/em&gt; him on a project. A true professional team player feels himself equal to all other members of the project, no matter how high they are in the hierarchy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At the same time, he strictly follows the process and obeys all project rules and instructions, not because he is afraid of being fired but because he wants the project to succeed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Second, being a professional team player requires a constant readiness to resist each and every instruction if you feel it contradicts the project objectives. A true professional doesn’t work for a boss. He doesn’t want to make the boss happy. He actually doesn’t care whether the boss is happy or not. He knows that the real boss is the project and tries to make the project successful and … happy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A true professional always works for himself. Jeff wants to learn Scala and earn a certain amount of cash. He joined the project in order to satisfy these needs. If the project fails, Jeff won’t get the money and won’t fully learn Scala. So if the boss tells Jeff to do something that may jeopardize the project’s success, will Jeff do it? Does he care about disappointing the boss? Absolutely not. All he cares about is the project’s success, which translates to his personal success.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thus, making your boss happy is a goal for the immature, fearsome, lazy, and weak. Making your project successful is an objective for professional, strong, mature, and brave team players.&lt;/p&gt; "/> <meta name="twitter:url" property="og:url"

In a properly managed and organized project, everybody sees and feels how his or her personal needs are satisfied when the project <a href="/2015/02/12/top-down-design.html">achieves</a> its objectives: Jeff learns Scala, Sally sees Paris, and Bob buys a new house.</p><p>However, if Jeff wants to learn Scala and we’re developing an iOS application, that is a problem for the boss to resolve. Either convince Jeff to fall in love with Swift (I doubt that’s possible) or replace him with someone who is already in love with it. It’s clear that a professional boss will resort to such a tragic act as <a href="/2015/09/16/how-to-fire-someone-right.html">firing</a> Jeff not because of his personal feelings towards Jeff but because they are both working toward the project objectives. Jeff and the boss will both understand that Jeff’s need to learn Scala is not aligned with the objective of the project.</p><p>It is the CTO’s responsibility to do something about Jeff when his personal needs become misaligned with the objectives of the project that is paying his salary. A professional CEO understands that and always acts in the best interest of the project, not of himself or anyone else personally.</p><p>I believe a professional team player does two things: <strong>obeys and resists</strong>.</p><p>First, you have to understand that the boss is here in order to help you organize your time, your tasks, your communications, your plans, etc. He knows more about the project and uses that information to help you do your job. Your real boss is the project; the boss you interact with is just a hired manager who translates project objectives into plans, instructions, schedules, etc.</p><aside class="quote">Being a professional team player requires a constant readiness to resist each and every instruction.</aside><p>This boss is your colleague who does management while you’re writing code. You’re both equal. You and he are in the same boat. Your functions are different than his; that’s all. You’re not working <em>for</em> him but <em>with</em> him on a project. A true professional team player feels himself equal to all other members of the project, no matter how high they are in the hierarchy.</p><p>At the same time, he strictly follows the process and obeys all project rules and instructions, not because he is afraid of being fired but because he wants the project to succeed.</p><p>Second, being a professional team player requires a constant readiness to resist each and every instruction if you feel it contradicts the project objectives. A true professional doesn’t work for a boss. He doesn’t want to make the boss happy. He actually doesn’t care whether the boss is happy or not. He knows that the real boss is the project and tries to make the project successful and … happy.</p><p>A true professional always works for himself. Jeff wants to learn Scala and earn a certain amount of cash. He joined the project in order to satisfy these needs. If the project fails, Jeff won’t get the money and won’t fully learn Scala. So if the boss tells Jeff to do something that may jeopardize the project’s success, will Jeff do it? Does he care about disappointing the boss? Absolutely not. All he cares about is the project’s success, which translates to his personal success.</p><p>Thus, making your boss happy is a goal for the immature, fearsome, lazy, and weak. Making your project successful is an objective for professional, strong, mature, and brave team players.</p></div></article></div><div class="wrapper"> <related-posts /></div><div class="disqus" role="complementary"><p class="disqus_hint"> Please, use <a href="https://help.disqus.com/commenting/what-html-tags-are-allowed-within-comments">syntax highlighting</a> in your comments, to make them more readable.</p><div id="disqus_thread" class="disqus-thread"> <a>&nbsp;</a></div><script> var disqus_config = function () { this.page.url = document.location.href.split('?')[0].split('#')[0].replace('https://', 'http://'); this.page.identifier = this.page.url; }; (function() { var d = document, s = d.createElement('script'); s.src = '//yegor256.disqus.com/embed.js'; s.setAttribute('data-timestamp', +new Date()); (d.head || d.body).appendChild(s); })(); </script> <noscript><div><p class="red"> JavaScript is disabled in your browser, that's why you can't see comments under this post.</p></div></noscript></div><div class="wrapper"> <footer class="footer"><p> &copy; <span itemscope="" itemprop="copyrightHolder" itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"> <span itemprop="name">Yegor Bugayenko</span> </span> 2014&ndash;<span itemprop="copyrightYear">2018</span></p></footer></div></section><div class="wrapper unprintable" style="text-align:center;margin-top:2em;"> <a href="http://www.sixnines.io/h/3ba1652f"> <img src="//www.sixnines.io/b/3ba1652f?style=flat" alt="sixnines availability badge"/> </a></div><script src="//code.jquery.com/jquery-1.9.0.min.js"></script> <script src="/js/all.js?c998b88f617"></script> <script>var disqus_shortname = 'yegor256';</script> <script id="dsq-count-scr" src="//yegor256.disqus.com/count.js" async="async"></script> <script> (function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){ (i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o), m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m) })(window,document,'script','//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga'); ga('create', 'UA-1963507-32', 'auto'); ga('send', 'pageview'); </script> <script> Cd=document;Cr="&"+Math.random();Cp="&s=1"; Cd.cookie="b=b";if(Cd.cookie)Cp+="&c=1"; Cp+="&t="+(new Date()).getTimezoneOffset(); if(self!=top)Cp+="&f=1"; </script> <script> if(navigator.javaEnabled())Cp+="&j=1"; </script> <script> if(typeof(screen)!='undefined')Cp+="&w="+screen.width+"&h="+ screen.height+"&d="+(screen.colorDepth?screen.colorDepth:screen.pixelDepth); </script> <script> Cd.write("<img src='//c.hit.ua/hit?i=95870&g=0&x=2"+Cp+Cr+ "&r="+escape(Cd.referrer)+"&u="+escape(window.location.href)+ "' border='0' wi"+"dth='1' he"+"ight='1'/>"); </script> <script type="application/ld+json"> { "@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Person", "name": "Yegor Bugayenko", "url": "https://www.yegor256.com", "sameAs": [ "https://www.facebook.com/yegor256", "https://instagram.com/yegor256", "https://www.linkedin.com/in/yegor256", "https://twitter.com/yegor256", "https://github.com/yegor256", "https://www.pinterest.com/yegor256/" ] } </script> </body> </html> <!DOCTYPE html> <html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/WebSite"> <head> <meta charset="utf-8"/> <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;You have a task assigned to you, and you don’t like it.

Here are some tips I recommend to my peers who code with me in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zerocracy.com&quot;&gt;Zerocracy&lt;/a&gt; projects. In a nutshell, I’m going to explain how you can &lt;em&gt;cut corners&lt;/em&gt; and remain professional, 1) protecting your nerves, 2) optimizing your project’s expenses, and 3) increasing the quality of the source code.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;youtube&quot;&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6r2W3P9vgY&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;box&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://i.ytimg.com/vi/b6r2W3P9vgY/mqdefault.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;YouTube video #b6r2W3P9vgY&quot; /&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;play&quot;&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;icon icon-play&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;div&gt;Blame the Project; 16 April 2016.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;Here is a list of options you have, in order of preference. I would recommend you start with the first one on the list and proceed down when you have to.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;create-dependencies-blame-them-and-wait&quot;&gt;Create Dependencies, Blame Them, and Wait&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is the first and most preferable option. If you can’t figure out how to fix an issue or how to implement a new feature, it’s a fault of the project, not you. Even if you can’t figure it out because you don’t know anything about Ruby and they hired you to fix bugs in a Ruby on Rails code base—it’s their fault. Why did they hire you when you know nothing about Ruby?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So be positive; don’t blame yourself. If you don’t know how this damn code works, it’s a fault of the code, not you. Good code is easy to understand and maintain.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;badge&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.yegor256.com/images/2015/01/cut-corners-1.png&quot; style=&quot;width:250px;max-width:100%;&quot; alt=&quot;badge&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Don’t try to eat spaghetti code; complain to the chef and ask him or her to cook something better (BTW, I love spaghetti).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;How can you do that? Create dependencies—new bugs complaining about unclear design, lack of unit tests, absence of necessary classes, or whatever. Be creative and offensive—in a constructive and professional way, of course. Don’t get personal. No matter who cooked that spaghetti, you have nothing against him or her personally. You just want another dish, that’s all.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;If you don't know how this damn code works, it's a fault of the code, not you.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;Once you have those dependencies reported, explain in the main ticket that you can’t continue until all of them are resolved. You will legally stop working, and someone else will improve the code you need. Later, when all dependencies are resolved and the code looks better, try to get back to it again. If you still see issues, create new dependencies. Keep doing this until the code in front of you is clean and easy to fix.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Don’t be &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/12/29/turnover-is-good-for-maintainability.html&quot;&gt;a hero&lt;/a&gt;—don’t rush into fixing the &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/11/24/imprisonment-for-irresponsible-coding.html&quot;&gt;bad code&lt;/a&gt; you inherited. Think &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/10/26/hacker-vs-programmer-mentality.html&quot;&gt;like a developer, not a hacker&lt;/a&gt;. Remember that your first and most important responsibility as a disciplined engineer is to help the project &lt;em&gt;reveal&lt;/em&gt; maintainability issues. Who will fix them and how is the responsibility of a &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/05/24/who-is-project-manager.html&quot;&gt;project manager&lt;/a&gt;. Your job is to reveal, not to hide. By being a hero and trying to fix everything in the scope of a single task, you’re not doing the project a favor—you’re concealing the problem(s).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Edit: Another good example of a dependency may be a question raised at, for example, &lt;a href=&quot;/2017/02/14/stackoverflow-is-your-tool.html&quot;&gt;StackOverflow&lt;/a&gt; or a user list of a third-party library. If you can’t find a solution yourself and the problem is outside of the scope of your project—submit a question to SO and put its link to the source code (in JavaDoc block, for example).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;demand-better-documentation-and-wait&quot;&gt;Demand Better Documentation and Wait&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;All dependencies are resolved and the code looks clean, but you still don’t understand how to fix the problem or implement a new feature. It’s too complex. Or maybe you just don’t know how this library works. Or you’ve never done anything like that before. Anyhow, you can’t continue because you don’t understand. And in order to understand, you will need a lot of time—much more than you have from your project manager or your Scrum board. What do you do?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;badge&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.yegor256.com/images/2015/01/cut-corners-2.png&quot; style=&quot;width:250px;max-width:100%;&quot; alt=&quot;badge&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Again, think positively and don’t blame yourself. If the software is not clear enough for a total stranger, it’s “their” fault, not yours. They created the software in a way that’s difficult to digest and modify. But the code is clean; it’s not spaghetti anymore. It’s a perfectly cooked lobster, but you don’t know how to eat lobster! You’ve never ate it before.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The chef did a good job; he cooked it well, but the restaurant didn’t give you any instructions on how to eat such a sophisticated dish. What do you do?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You ask for a manual. You ask for documentation. Properly designed and written source code must be properly documented. Once you see that something is not clear for you, create new dependencies that ask for better documentation of certain aspects of the code.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Again, don’t be a hero and try to understand everything yourself. Of course you’re a smart guy, but the project doesn’t need a single smart guy. The project needs &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/12/29/turnover-is-good-for-maintainability.html&quot;&gt;maintainable code&lt;/a&gt; that is easy to modify, even by someone who is not as smart as yourself. So do your project a favor: reveal the documentation issue, and ask someone to fix it for you. Not just for you, for everybody. The entire team will benefit from such a request. Once the documentation is fixed, you will continue with your task, and everybody will get source code that is a bit better than it was before. Win-win, isn’t it?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;reproduce-the-bug-and-call-it-a-day&quot;&gt;Reproduce the Bug and Call It a Day&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now the code is clean, the documentation is good enough, but you’re stuck anyway. What to do? Well, I’m a big fan of test-driven development, so my next suggestion would be to create a test that reproduces the bug. Basically, this is what you should start every ticket with, be it a bug or a feature. Catch the bug with a unit test! Prove that the bug exists by failing the build with a new test.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;badge&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/1SdcZ8M&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.yegor256.com/images/2015/01/working-effectively-with-legacy-code.png&quot; style=&quot;width:96px;max-width:100%;&quot; alt=&quot;badge&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;This may be rather difficult to achieve, especially when the software you’re trying to fix or modify was written by &lt;span class=&quot;strike&quot;&gt;idiots&lt;/span&gt; someone who had no idea about unit testing. There are plenty of techniques that may help you find a way to make such software more testable. I would highly recommend you read &lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/1SdcZ8M&quot;&gt;Working Effectively with Legacy Code&lt;/a&gt; by Michael Feathers. There are many different patterns, and most of them work.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Catching a bug with a unit test is, in most cases, more than 80% of success.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;Once you manage to reproduce the bug and the build fails, stop right there. That’s more than enough for a single piece of work. Skip the test (for example, using &lt;code&gt;@Ignore&lt;/code&gt; annotation in JUnit 4) and commit your changes. Then add documentation to the unit test you just created, preferably in the form of a &lt;code&gt;@todo&lt;/code&gt;. Explain there that you managed to reproduce the problem but didn’t have enough time to fix it. Or maybe you just don’t know how to fix it. Be honest and give all possible details.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I believe that catching a bug with a unit test is, in most cases, more than 80% of success. The rest is way more simple: just fix the code and make the test pass. Leave this job to someone else.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;prove-a-bugs-absence&quot;&gt;Prove a Bug’s Absence&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Very often you simply can’t reproduce a bug. That’s not because the code is not testable and can’t be used in a unit test but because you can’t reproduce an error situation. You know that the code crashes in production, but you can’t crash it in a test. The error stack trace reported by the end user or your production logging system is not reproducible. It’s a very common situation. What do you do?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;badge&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.yegor256.com/images/2015/01/cut-corners-3.png&quot; style=&quot;width:250px;max-width:100%;&quot; alt=&quot;badge&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;I think the best option here is to create a test that will prove that the code works as intended. The test won’t fail, and the build will remain clean. You will commit it to the repository and … report that the problem is solved. You will say that the reported bug doesn’t really exist in real life. You will state that there is no bug—“our software works correctly; here is the proof: see my new unit test.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Will they believe you? I don’t think so, but they don’t have a choice. They can’t push you any further. You’ve already done something—created a new test that proves everything is fine. The ticket will be closed and the project will move on.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;youtube&quot;&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBQoTZ-1X-o&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;box&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YBQoTZ-1X-o/mqdefault.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;YouTube video #YBQoTZ-1X-o&quot; /&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;play&quot;&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;icon icon-play&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;div&gt;How to Cut Corners and Stay Cool (webinar #15); 1 June 2016.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;If, later on, the same problem occurs in production, a new bug will be reported. It will be linked to your ticket. Your experience will help someone investigate the bug further. Maybe that guy will also fail to catch the bug with a test and will also create a new, successful and “useless” test. And this may happen again and again. Eventually, this cumulative group experience will help the last guy catch the bug and fix it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thus, a new passing test is a good response to a bug that you can’t catch with a unit test.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;disable-the-feature&quot;&gt;Disable the Feature&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sometimes the unit test technique won’t work, mostly because a bug will be too important to be ignored. They won’t agree with you when you show them a unit test that proves the bug doesn’t exist. They will tell you that “when our users are trying to download a PDF, they get a blank page.” And they will also say they don’t really care about your bloody unit tests. All they care about is that PDF document that should be downloadable. So the trick with a unit test won’t work. What do you do?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Production errors are not programmers' mistakes, though delayed tickets are.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;It depends on many factors, and most of these factors are not technical. They are political, organizational, managerial, social, you name it. However, in most cases, I would recommend you disable that toxic feature, release a new version, and close the ticket.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You will take the problem off your shoulders and everybody will be pleased. Well, except that poor end user. But this is not your problem. This is the fault of management, which didn’t organize pre-production testing properly. Again, don’t take this blame on yourself. Your job is to keep the code clean and finish your tickets in a reasonable amount of time. Their job is to make sure that developers, testers, DevOps, marketers, product managers, and designers work together to deliver the product with an acceptable number of errors.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Production errors are not programmers’ mistakes, though delayed tickets are. If you keep a ticket in your hands for too long, you become an unmanageable unit of work. They simply can’t manage you anymore. You’re doing something, trying to fix the bug, saying “I’m trying, I’m trying …” How can they manage such a guy? Instead, you should deliver quickly, even if it comes at the cost of a temporarily disabled feature.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;say-no&quot;&gt;Say No&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;OK, let’s say none of the above works. The code is clean, the documentation is acceptable, but you can’t catch the bug, and they don’t accept a unit test from you as proof of the bug’s absence. They also don’t allow you to disable a feature, because it is critical to the user experience. What choices do you have? Just one.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;badge&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.yegor256.com/images/2015/01/cut-corners-4.png&quot; style=&quot;width:250px;max-width:100%;&quot; alt=&quot;badge&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Be professional and say “No, I can’t do this; find someone else.” Being a professional developer doesn’t mean being able to fix any problem. Instead, it means honesty. If you see that you can’t fix the problem, say so as soon as possible. Let them decide what to do. If they eventually decide to fire you because of that, you will remain a professional. They will remember you as a guy who was honest and took his reputation seriously. In the end, you will win.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Don’t hold the task in your hands. The minute you realize you’re not the best guy for it or you simply can’t fix it—notify your manager. Make it his problem. Actually, it is his problem in the first place. He hired you. He &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/03/01/how-we-interview-programmers.html&quot;&gt;interviewed&lt;/a&gt; you. He decided to give you this task. He estimated your abilities and your skills. So it’s payback time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Being a professional developer doesn't mean being able to fix any problem.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;Your “No!” will be very valuable feedback for him. It will help him make his next important management decisions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On the other hand, if you lie just to give the impression you’re a guy who can fix anything and yet fail in the end, you will damage not only your reputation but also the project’s performance and objectives.&lt;/p&gt; " /> <meta name="keywords" content="next, path, output, content, previous, url, relative_path, id, collection, excerpt, draft, categories, layout, title, date, tags, description, keywords, translated, image, jb_picture, slug, ext" /> <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1"/> <meta name="google-site-verification" content="JEj_gQr2CPe2QKGw8XdMz0R7VboQIUbX3FlM-lwTq-8" /> <meta name="author" content="Yegor Bugayenko"> <meta name="article:published_time" content="2015-01-15 00:00:00 +0000"> <meta name="og:site_name" content="Yegor Bugayenko"/> <meta name="og:type" content="article" /> <meta name="og:locale" content="en_US" /> <meta name="twitter:account_id" content="4503599630178231" /> <meta name="twitter:creator" content="@yegor256"/> <meta name="twitter:site" content="@yegor256"/> <meta name="twitter:title" property="og:title" content="How to Cut Corners and Stay Cool"/> <meta name="twitter:description" property="og:description" content="&lt;p&gt;You have a task assigned to you, and you don’t like it.

In a nutshell, I’m going to explain how you can &lt;em&gt;cut corners&lt;/em&gt; and remain professional, 1) protecting your nerves, 2) optimizing your project’s expenses, and 3) increasing the quality of the source code.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;youtube&quot;&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6r2W3P9vgY&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;box&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://i.ytimg.com/vi/b6r2W3P9vgY/mqdefault.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;YouTube video #b6r2W3P9vgY&quot; /&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;play&quot;&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;icon icon-play&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;div&gt;Blame the Project; 16 April 2016.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;Here is a list of options you have, in order of preference. I would recommend you start with the first one on the list and proceed down when you have to.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;create-dependencies-blame-them-and-wait&quot;&gt;Create Dependencies, Blame Them, and Wait&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is the first and most preferable option. If you can’t figure out how to fix an issue or how to implement a new feature, it’s a fault of the project, not you. Even if you can’t figure it out because you don’t know anything about Ruby and they hired you to fix bugs in a Ruby on Rails code base—it’s their fault. Why did they hire you when you know nothing about Ruby?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So be positive; don’t blame yourself. If you don’t know how this damn code works, it’s a fault of the code, not you. Good code is easy to understand and maintain.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;badge&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.yegor256.com/images/2015/01/cut-corners-1.png&quot; style=&quot;width:250px;max-width:100%;&quot; alt=&quot;badge&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Don’t try to eat spaghetti code; complain to the chef and ask him or her to cook something better (BTW, I love spaghetti).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;How can you do that? Create dependencies—new bugs complaining about unclear design, lack of unit tests, absence of necessary classes, or whatever. Be creative and offensive—in a constructive and professional way, of course. Don’t get personal. No matter who cooked that spaghetti, you have nothing against him or her personally. You just want another dish, that’s all.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;If you don't know how this damn code works, it's a fault of the code, not you.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;Once you have those dependencies reported, explain in the main ticket that you can’t continue until all of them are resolved. You will legally stop working, and someone else will improve the code you need. Later, when all dependencies are resolved and the code looks better, try to get back to it again. If you still see issues, create new dependencies. Keep doing this until the code in front of you is clean and easy to fix.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Don’t be &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/12/29/turnover-is-good-for-maintainability.html&quot;&gt;a hero&lt;/a&gt;—don’t rush into fixing the &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/11/24/imprisonment-for-irresponsible-coding.html&quot;&gt;bad code&lt;/a&gt; you inherited. Think &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/10/26/hacker-vs-programmer-mentality.html&quot;&gt;like a developer, not a hacker&lt;/a&gt;. Remember that your first and most important responsibility as a disciplined engineer is to help the project &lt;em&gt;reveal&lt;/em&gt; maintainability issues. Who will fix them and how is the responsibility of a &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/05/24/who-is-project-manager.html&quot;&gt;project manager&lt;/a&gt;. Your job is to reveal, not to hide. By being a hero and trying to fix everything in the scope of a single task, you’re not doing the project a favor—you’re concealing the problem(s).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Edit: Another good example of a dependency may be a question raised at, for example, &lt;a href=&quot;/2017/02/14/stackoverflow-is-your-tool.html&quot;&gt;StackOverflow&lt;/a&gt; or a user list of a third-party library. If you can’t find a solution yourself and the problem is outside of the scope of your project—submit a question to SO and put its link to the source code (in JavaDoc block, for example).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;demand-better-documentation-and-wait&quot;&gt;Demand Better Documentation and Wait&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;All dependencies are resolved and the code looks clean, but you still don’t understand how to fix the problem or implement a new feature. It’s too complex. Or maybe you just don’t know how this library works. Or you’ve never done anything like that before. Anyhow, you can’t continue because you don’t understand. And in order to understand, you will need a lot of time—much more than you have from your project manager or your Scrum board. What do you do?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;badge&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.yegor256.com/images/2015/01/cut-corners-2.png&quot; style=&quot;width:250px;max-width:100%;&quot; alt=&quot;badge&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Again, think positively and don’t blame yourself. If the software is not clear enough for a total stranger, it’s “their” fault, not yours. They created the software in a way that’s difficult to digest and modify. But the code is clean; it’s not spaghetti anymore. It’s a perfectly cooked lobster, but you don’t know how to eat lobster! You’ve never ate it before.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The chef did a good job; he cooked it well, but the restaurant didn’t give you any instructions on how to eat such a sophisticated dish. What do you do?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You ask for a manual. You ask for documentation. Properly designed and written source code must be properly documented. Once you see that something is not clear for you, create new dependencies that ask for better documentation of certain aspects of the code.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Again, don’t be a hero and try to understand everything yourself. Of course you’re a smart guy, but the project doesn’t need a single smart guy. The project needs &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/12/29/turnover-is-good-for-maintainability.html&quot;&gt;maintainable code&lt;/a&gt; that is easy to modify, even by someone who is not as smart as yourself. So do your project a favor: reveal the documentation issue, and ask someone to fix it for you. Not just for you, for everybody. The entire team will benefit from such a request. Once the documentation is fixed, you will continue with your task, and everybody will get source code that is a bit better than it was before. Win-win, isn’t it?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;reproduce-the-bug-and-call-it-a-day&quot;&gt;Reproduce the Bug and Call It a Day&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now the code is clean, the documentation is good enough, but you’re stuck anyway. What to do? Well, I’m a big fan of test-driven development, so my next suggestion would be to create a test that reproduces the bug. Basically, this is what you should start every ticket with, be it a bug or a feature. Catch the bug with a unit test! Prove that the bug exists by failing the build with a new test.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;badge&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/1SdcZ8M&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.yegor256.com/images/2015/01/working-effectively-with-legacy-code.png&quot; style=&quot;width:96px;max-width:100%;&quot; alt=&quot;badge&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;This may be rather difficult to achieve, especially when the software you’re trying to fix or modify was written by &lt;span class=&quot;strike&quot;&gt;idiots&lt;/span&gt; someone who had no idea about unit testing. There are plenty of techniques that may help you find a way to make such software more testable. I would highly recommend you read &lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/1SdcZ8M&quot;&gt;Working Effectively with Legacy Code&lt;/a&gt; by Michael Feathers. There are many different patterns, and most of them work.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Catching a bug with a unit test is, in most cases, more than 80% of success.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;Once you manage to reproduce the bug and the build fails, stop right there. That’s more than enough for a single piece of work. Skip the test (for example, using &lt;code&gt;@Ignore&lt;/code&gt; annotation in JUnit 4) and commit your changes. Then add documentation to the unit test you just created, preferably in the form of a &lt;code&gt;@todo&lt;/code&gt;. Explain there that you managed to reproduce the problem but didn’t have enough time to fix it. Or maybe you just don’t know how to fix it. Be honest and give all possible details.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I believe that catching a bug with a unit test is, in most cases, more than 80% of success. The rest is way more simple: just fix the code and make the test pass. Leave this job to someone else.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;prove-a-bugs-absence&quot;&gt;Prove a Bug’s Absence&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Very often you simply can’t reproduce a bug. That’s not because the code is not testable and can’t be used in a unit test but because you can’t reproduce an error situation. You know that the code crashes in production, but you can’t crash it in a test. The error stack trace reported by the end user or your production logging system is not reproducible. It’s a very common situation. What do you do?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;badge&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.yegor256.com/images/2015/01/cut-corners-3.png&quot; style=&quot;width:250px;max-width:100%;&quot; alt=&quot;badge&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;I think the best option here is to create a test that will prove that the code works as intended. The test won’t fail, and the build will remain clean. You will commit it to the repository and … report that the problem is solved. You will say that the reported bug doesn’t really exist in real life. You will state that there is no bug—“our software works correctly; here is the proof: see my new unit test.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Will they believe you? I don’t think so, but they don’t have a choice. They can’t push you any further. You’ve already done something—created a new test that proves everything is fine. The ticket will be closed and the project will move on.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;youtube&quot;&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBQoTZ-1X-o&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;box&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YBQoTZ-1X-o/mqdefault.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;YouTube video #YBQoTZ-1X-o&quot; /&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;play&quot;&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;icon icon-play&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;div&gt;How to Cut Corners and Stay Cool (webinar #15); 1 June 2016.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;If, later on, the same problem occurs in production, a new bug will be reported. It will be linked to your ticket. Your experience will help someone investigate the bug further. Maybe that guy will also fail to catch the bug with a test and will also create a new, successful and “useless” test. And this may happen again and again. Eventually, this cumulative group experience will help the last guy catch the bug and fix it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thus, a new passing test is a good response to a bug that you can’t catch with a unit test.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;disable-the-feature&quot;&gt;Disable the Feature&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sometimes the unit test technique won’t work, mostly because a bug will be too important to be ignored. They won’t agree with you when you show them a unit test that proves the bug doesn’t exist. They will tell you that “when our users are trying to download a PDF, they get a blank page.” And they will also say they don’t really care about your bloody unit tests. All they care about is that PDF document that should be downloadable. So the trick with a unit test won’t work. What do you do?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Production errors are not programmers' mistakes, though delayed tickets are.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;It depends on many factors, and most of these factors are not technical. They are political, organizational, managerial, social, you name it. However, in most cases, I would recommend you disable that toxic feature, release a new version, and close the ticket.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You will take the problem off your shoulders and everybody will be pleased. Well, except that poor end user. But this is not your problem. This is the fault of management, which didn’t organize pre-production testing properly. Again, don’t take this blame on yourself. Your job is to keep the code clean and finish your tickets in a reasonable amount of time. Their job is to make sure that developers, testers, DevOps, marketers, product managers, and designers work together to deliver the product with an acceptable number of errors.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Production errors are not programmers’ mistakes, though delayed tickets are. If you keep a ticket in your hands for too long, you become an unmanageable unit of work. They simply can’t manage you anymore. You’re doing something, trying to fix the bug, saying “I’m trying, I’m trying …” How can they manage such a guy? Instead, you should deliver quickly, even if it comes at the cost of a temporarily disabled feature.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;say-no&quot;&gt;Say No&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;OK, let’s say none of the above works. The code is clean, the documentation is acceptable, but you can’t catch the bug, and they don’t accept a unit test from you as proof of the bug’s absence. They also don’t allow you to disable a feature, because it is critical to the user experience. What choices do you have? Just one.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;badge&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.yegor256.com/images/2015/01/cut-corners-4.png&quot; style=&quot;width:250px;max-width:100%;&quot; alt=&quot;badge&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Be professional and say “No, I can’t do this; find someone else.” Being a professional developer doesn’t mean being able to fix any problem. Instead, it means honesty. If you see that you can’t fix the problem, say so as soon as possible. Let them decide what to do. If they eventually decide to fire you because of that, you will remain a professional. They will remember you as a guy who was honest and took his reputation seriously. In the end, you will win.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Don’t hold the task in your hands. The minute you realize you’re not the best guy for it or you simply can’t fix it—notify your manager. Make it his problem. Actually, it is his problem in the first place. He hired you. He &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/03/01/how-we-interview-programmers.html&quot;&gt;interviewed&lt;/a&gt; you. He decided to give you this task. He estimated your abilities and your skills. So it’s payback time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Being a professional developer doesn't mean being able to fix any problem.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;Your “No!” will be very valuable feedback for him. It will help him make his next important management decisions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On the other hand, if you lie just to give the impression you’re a guy who can fix anything and yet fail in the end, you will damage not only your reputation but also the project’s performance and objectives.&lt;/p&gt; "/> <meta name="twitter:url" property="og:url"

I would recommend you start with the first one on the list and proceed down when you have to.</p><h2 id="create-dependencies-blame-them-and-wait">Create Dependencies, Blame Them, and Wait</h2><p>This is the first and most preferable option. If you can’t figure out how to fix an issue or how to implement a new feature, it’s a fault of the project, not you. Even if you can’t figure it out because you don’t know anything about Ruby and they hired you to fix bugs in a Ruby on Rails code base—it’s their fault. Why did they hire you when you know nothing about Ruby?</p><p>So be positive; don’t blame yourself. If you don’t know how this damn code works, it’s a fault of the code, not you. Good code is easy to understand and maintain.</p><figure class="badge"><img src="https://www.yegor256.com/images/2015/01/cut-corners-1.png" style="width:250px;max-width:100%;" alt="badge" /></figure><p>Don’t try to eat spaghetti code; complain to the chef and ask him or her to cook something better (BTW, I love spaghetti).</p><p>How can you do that? Create dependencies—new bugs complaining about unclear design, lack of unit tests, absence of necessary classes, or whatever. Be creative and offensive—in a constructive and professional way, of course. Don’t get personal. No matter who cooked that spaghetti, you have nothing against him or her personally. You just want another dish, that’s all.</p><aside class="quote">If you don't know how this damn code works, it's a fault of the code, not you.</aside><p>Once you have those dependencies reported, explain in the main ticket that you can’t continue until all of them are resolved. You will legally stop working, and someone else will improve the code you need. Later, when all dependencies are resolved and the code looks better, try to get back to it again. If you still see issues, create new dependencies. Keep doing this until the code in front of you is clean and easy to fix.</p><p>Don’t be <a href="/2015/12/29/turnover-is-good-for-maintainability.html">a hero</a>—don’t rush into fixing the <a href="/2015/11/24/imprisonment-for-irresponsible-coding.html">bad code</a> you inherited. Think <a href="/2014/10/26/hacker-vs-programmer-mentality.html">like a developer, not a hacker</a>. Remember that your first and most important responsibility as a disciplined engineer is to help the project <em>reveal</em> maintainability issues. Who will fix them and how is the responsibility of a <a href="/2016/05/24/who-is-project-manager.html">project manager</a>. Your job is to reveal, not to hide. By being a hero and trying to fix everything in the scope of a single task, you’re not doing the project a favor—you’re concealing the problem(s).</p><p>Edit: Another good example of a dependency may be a question raised at, for example, <a href="/2017/02/14/stackoverflow-is-your-tool.html">StackOverflow</a> or a user list of a third-party library. If you can’t find a solution yourself and the problem is outside of the scope of your project—submit a question to SO and put its link to the source code (in JavaDoc block, for example).</p><h2 id="demand-better-documentation-and-wait">Demand Better Documentation and Wait</h2><p>All dependencies are resolved and the code looks clean, but you still don’t understand how to fix the problem or implement a new feature. It’s too complex. Or maybe you just don’t know how this library works. Or you’ve never done anything like that before. Anyhow, you can’t continue because you don’t understand. And in order to understand, you will need a lot of time—much more than you have from your project manager or your Scrum board. What do you do?</p><figure class="badge"><img src="https://www.yegor256.com/images/2015/01/cut-corners-2.png" style="width:250px;max-width:100%;" alt="badge" /></figure><p>Again, think positively and don’t blame yourself. If the software is not clear enough for a total stranger, it’s “their” fault, not yours. They created the software in a way that’s difficult to digest and modify. But the code is clean; it’s not spaghetti anymore. It’s a perfectly cooked lobster, but you don’t know how to eat lobster! You’ve never ate it before.</p><p>The chef did a good job; he cooked it well, but the restaurant didn’t give you any instructions on how to eat such a sophisticated dish. What do you do?</p><p>You ask for a manual. You ask for documentation. Properly designed and written source code must be properly documented. Once you see that something is not clear for you, create new dependencies that ask for better documentation of certain aspects of the code.</p><p>Again, don’t be a hero and try to understand everything yourself. Of course you’re a smart guy, but the project doesn’t need a single smart guy. The project needs <a href="/2015/12/29/turnover-is-good-for-maintainability.html">maintainable code</a> that is easy to modify, even by someone who is not as smart as yourself. So do your project a favor: reveal the documentation issue, and ask someone to fix it for you. Not just for you, for everybody. The entire team will benefit from such a request. Once the documentation is fixed, you will continue with your task, and everybody will get source code that is a bit better than it was before. Win-win, isn’t it?</p><h2 id="reproduce-the-bug-and-call-it-a-day">Reproduce the Bug and Call It a Day</h2><p>Now the code is clean, the documentation is good enough, but you’re stuck anyway. What to do? Well, I’m a big fan of test-driven development, so my next suggestion would be to create a test that reproduces the bug. Basically, this is what you should start every ticket with, be it a bug or a feature. Catch the bug with a unit test! Prove that the bug exists by failing the build with a new test.</p><figure class="badge"><a href="http://amzn.to/1SdcZ8M"><img src="https://www.yegor256.com/images/2015/01/working-effectively-with-legacy-code.png" style="width:96px;max-width:100%;" alt="badge" /></a></figure><p>This may be rather difficult to achieve, especially when the software you’re trying to fix or modify was written by <span class="strike">idiots</span> someone who had no idea about unit testing. There are plenty of techniques that may help you find a way to make such software more testable. I would highly recommend you read <a href="http://amzn.to/1SdcZ8M">Working Effectively with Legacy Code</a> by Michael Feathers. There are many different patterns, and most of them work.</p><aside class="quote">Catching a bug with a unit test is, in most cases, more than 80% of success.</aside><p>Once you manage to reproduce the bug and the build fails, stop right there. That’s more than enough for a single piece of work. Skip the test (for example, using <code>@Ignore</code> annotation in JUnit 4) and commit your changes. Then add documentation to the unit test you just created, preferably in the form of a <code>@todo</code>. Explain there that you managed to reproduce the problem but didn’t have enough time to fix it. Or maybe you just don’t know how to fix it. Be honest and give all possible details.</p><p>I believe that catching a bug with a unit test is, in most cases, more than 80% of success. The rest is way more simple: just fix the code and make the test pass. Leave this job to someone else.</p><h2 id="prove-a-bugs-absence">Prove a Bug’s Absence</h2><p>Very often you simply can’t reproduce a bug. That’s not because the code is not testable and can’t be used in a unit test but because you can’t reproduce an error situation. You know that the code crashes in production, but you can’t crash it in a test. The error stack trace reported by the end user or your production logging system is not reproducible. It’s a very common situation. What do you do?</p><figure class="badge"><img src="https://www.yegor256.com/images/2015/01/cut-corners-3.png" style="width:250px;max-width:100%;" alt="badge" /></figure><p>I think the best option here is to create a test that will prove that the code works as intended. The test won’t fail, and the build will remain clean. You will commit it to the repository and … report that the problem is solved. You will say that the reported bug doesn’t really exist in real life. You will state that there is no bug—“our software works correctly; here is the proof: see my new unit test.”</p><p>Will they believe you? I don’t think so, but they don’t have a choice. They can’t push you any further. You’ve already done something—created a new test that proves everything is fine. The ticket will be closed and the project will move on.</p><aside class="youtube"> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBQoTZ-1X-o"><div class="box"> <img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YBQoTZ-1X-o/mqdefault.jpg" alt="YouTube video #YBQoTZ-1X-o" /><div class="play"><i class="icon icon-play"></i></div></div></a><div>How to Cut Corners and Stay Cool (webinar #15); 1 June 2016.</div></aside><p>If, later on, the same problem occurs in production, a new bug will be reported. It will be linked to your ticket. Your experience will help someone investigate the bug further. Maybe that guy will also fail to catch the bug with a test and will also create a new, successful and “useless” test. And this may happen again and again. Eventually, this cumulative group experience will help the last guy catch the bug and fix it.</p><p>Thus, a new passing test is a good response to a bug that you can’t catch with a unit test.</p><h2 id="disable-the-feature">Disable the Feature</h2><p>Sometimes the unit test technique won’t work, mostly because a bug will be too important to be ignored. They won’t agree with you when you show them a unit test that proves the bug doesn’t exist. They will tell you that “when our users are trying to download a PDF, they get a blank page.” And they will also say they don’t really care about your bloody unit tests. All they care about is that PDF document that should be downloadable. So the trick with a unit test won’t work. What do you do?</p><aside class="quote">Production errors are not programmers' mistakes, though delayed tickets are.</aside><p>It depends on many factors, and most of these factors are not technical. They are political, organizational, managerial, social, you name it. However, in most cases, I would recommend you disable that toxic feature, release a new version, and close the ticket.</p><p>You will take the problem off your shoulders and everybody will be pleased. Well, except that poor end user. But this is not your problem. This is the fault of management, which didn’t organize pre-production testing properly. Again, don’t take this blame on yourself. Your job is to keep the code clean and finish your tickets in a reasonable amount of time. Their job is to make sure that developers, testers, DevOps, marketers, product managers, and designers work together to deliver the product with an acceptable number of errors.</p><p>Production errors are not programmers’ mistakes, though delayed tickets are. If you keep a ticket in your hands for too long, you become an unmanageable unit of work. They simply can’t manage you anymore. You’re doing something, trying to fix the bug, saying “I’m trying, I’m trying …” How can they manage such a guy? Instead, you should deliver quickly, even if it comes at the cost of a temporarily disabled feature.</p><h2 id="say-no">Say No</h2><p>OK, let’s say none of the above works. The code is clean, the documentation is acceptable, but you can’t catch the bug, and they don’t accept a unit test from you as proof of the bug’s absence. They also don’t allow you to disable a feature, because it is critical to the user experience. What choices do you have? Just one.</p><figure class="badge"><img src="https://www.yegor256.com/images/2015/01/cut-corners-4.png" style="width:250px;max-width:100%;" alt="badge" /></figure><p>Be professional and say “No, I can’t do this; find someone else.” Being a professional developer doesn’t mean being able to fix any problem. Instead, it means honesty. If you see that you can’t fix the problem, say so as soon as possible. Let them decide what to do. If they eventually decide to fire you because of that, you will remain a professional. They will remember you as a guy who was honest and took his reputation seriously. In the end, you will win.</p><p>Don’t hold the task in your hands. The minute you realize you’re not the best guy for it or you simply can’t fix it—notify your manager. Make it his problem. Actually, it is his problem in the first place. He hired you. He <a href="/2016/03/01/how-we-interview-programmers.html">interviewed</a> you. He decided to give you this task. He estimated your abilities and your skills. So it’s payback time.</p><aside class="quote">Being a professional developer doesn't mean being able to fix any problem.</aside><p>Your “No!” will be very valuable feedback for him. It will help him make his next important management decisions.</p><p>On the other hand, if you lie just to give the impression you’re a guy who can fix anything and yet fail in the end, you will damage not only your reputation but also the project’s performance and objectives.</p></p><nav class="buttons notranslate desktop-only"> <a href="http://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://www.yegor256.com/2015/01/15/how-to-cut-corners.html" title="Share on Facebook" class="button" rel="nofollow"> <span class="count count-facebook">0</span> <i class="icon icon-facebook notranslate" aria-hidden="true"></i> </a> <a href="https://twitter.com/share?url=https://www.yegor256.com/2015/01/15/how-to-cut-corners.html&amp;text=How+to+Cut+Corners+and+Stay+Cool" title="Share on Twitter" class="button" rel="nofollow"> <span class="count count-twitter">0</span> <i class="icon icon-twitter notranslate" aria-hidden="true"></i> </a> <a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=https://www.yegor256.com/2015/01/15/how-to-cut-corners.html" title="Share on Google+" class="button" rel="nofollow"> <span class="count count-googleplus">0</span> <i class="icon icon-googleplus notranslate" aria-hidden="true"></i> </a> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/cws/share?url=https://www.yegor256.com/2015/01/15/how-to-cut-corners.html" title="Share on LinkedIn" class="button" rel="nofollow"> <span class="count count-linkedin">0</span> <i class="icon icon-linkedin notranslate" aria-hidden="true"></i> </a> <a href="http://reddit.com/submit?url=https://www.yegor256.com/2015/01/15/how-to-cut-corners.html%3F2015-02&amp;title=How+to+Cut+Corners+and+Stay+Cool" title="Share on Reddit" class="button" rel="nofollow"> <span class="count count-reddit">0</span> <i class="icon icon-reddit notranslate" aria-hidden="true"></i> </a> <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/submitlink?u=https://www.yegor256.com/2015/01/15/how-to-cut-corners.html%3F2015-02&amp;t=How+to+Cut+Corners+and+Stay+Cool" title="Share on Hacker News" class="button" rel="nofollow"> <span class="count count-hackernews">0</span> <i class="icon icon-hackernews notranslate" aria-hidden="true"></i> </a> </nav> </header> <article class="main" itemprop="articleBody"><div ><p>You have a task assigned to you, and you don’t like it.

Instead, you should deliver quickly, even if it comes at the cost of a temporarily disabled feature.</p><h2 id="say-no">Say No</h2><p>OK, let’s say none of the above works. The code is clean, the documentation is acceptable, but you can’t catch the bug, and they don’t accept a unit test from you as proof of the bug’s absence. They also don’t allow you to disable a feature, because it is critical to the user experience. What choices do you have? Just one.</p><figure class="badge"><img src="https://www.yegor256.com/images/2015/01/cut-corners-4.png" style="width:250px;max-width:100%;" alt="badge" /></figure><p>Be professional and say “No, I can’t do this; find someone else.” Being a professional developer doesn’t mean being able to fix any problem.

In the next few paragraphs, I attempt to explain why these meetings, despite being so popular in software development teams, are &lt;em&gt;pure evil&lt;/em&gt; and should never be used by good &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/09/22/micromanagement.html&quot;&gt;managers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I’m not saying they can be done right or wrong; there are plenty of articles about that.

Because they not only “don’t work” but also do very bad, sometimes catastrophic, things to your management process, whether it’s &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/11/21/ringelmann-effect-vs-agile.html&quot;&gt;agile&lt;/a&gt; or not.

Strolling around the &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/10/06/how-to-be-good-office-slave.html&quot;&gt;office&lt;/a&gt; asking how things are going is a great habit of a terrible manager. He doesn’t know what his team is doing because he is not smart enough to organize the process and information flow correctly. However, he needs to know what’s going on because his boss is also asking him from time to time. So the only way to collect the required information is to ask the team, “What are you working on right now?” Morning stand-up is a perfect place to ask this annoying question officially without being marked as a manager who doesn’t know what he is doing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;youtube&quot;&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibT5oKToMoQ&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;box&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ibT5oKToMoQ/mqdefault.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;YouTube video #ibT5oKToMoQ&quot; /&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;play&quot;&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;icon icon-play&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;div&gt;Daily Stand-Up Meetings Are Evil (webinar #11); 3 February 2016.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Good Manager Is Being Told When Necessary&lt;/strong&gt;. Managing a project involves management of communications. When information flows are organized correctly, every team member knows when and how he or she has to report to the manager. When something goes wrong, everybody knows how such a situation has to be reported: immediately and directly. When a backlog task is completed, everybody understands how to inform a project manager if he needs this information. A &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/05/24/who-is-project-manager.html&quot;&gt;perfect project manager&lt;/a&gt; never asks his people. Instead, they tell him when necessary. And when someone does stop to tell him something, a good project manager fixes such a broken communication channel. But he never uses daily meetings to collect information.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;youtube&quot;&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dE0_j4Kk6jo&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;box&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dE0_j4Kk6jo/mqdefault.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;YouTube video #dE0_j4Kk6jo&quot; /&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;play&quot;&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;icon icon-play&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;div&gt;Meetings Help Us and Kill Our Projects; 6 April 2016.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;As a &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/09/22/micromanagement.html&quot;&gt;good manager&lt;/a&gt;, inform your team what your goals are and what’s important to you as a project manager (or Scrum master). They should know what’s important for you to know about their progress, risks, impediments, and failures. They should understand what trouble you will get into if they let you down. It is your job, as a good manager, to inform them about the most important issues the project and the team are working through. It’s their job, as a good team, to inform you immediately when they have some important information. This is what perfect management is about.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you manage to organize teamwork like that, you won’t need to wait until the next morning to ask your developers what they were doing yesterday and what problems they experienced. You would have seen this information earlier, exactly when you needed it. You would stay informed about your project affairs even outside of the office. Actually, you would not need an office at all, but that’s a subject for &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/07/21/hourly-pay-modern-slavery.html&quot;&gt;another discussion&lt;/a&gt; :)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;These morning meetings give the impression that the manager is working hard and well deserves his overblown salary.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;Someone may say that daily stand-ups are a perfect place and time to exchange information among programmers, not just to inform the Scrum master and get his feedback. Again, we have the same argument here—why can’t they exchange information when it’s required, during the day? Why do we need to put 10 people together every morning to discuss something that concerns only five of them? I can answer. &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/09/22/micromanagement.html&quot;&gt;Bad managers&lt;/a&gt;, who don’t know how else to organize the exchange of information between team members, use morning stand-ups as a replacement for a correct communication model. These morning meetings give the impression that the manager is working hard and well deserves his overblown salary. To the contrary, a good manager would never have any regular status update meetings, because he knows how to use effective &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/08/23/communication-maturity.html&quot;&gt;communication instruments&lt;/a&gt;, like issue tracking tools, &lt;a href=&quot;/2017/04/18/no-help-via-email.html&quot;&gt;emails&lt;/a&gt;, code reviews, decision-making meetings, pair programming, etc.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;responsibility&quot;&gt;Responsibility&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Bad Manager Micro-Manages&lt;/strong&gt;. This guy knows very little about project management, and that’s why he feels very insecure. He is afraid of losing control of the team; he doesn’t &lt;a href=&quot;/2017/11/21/trust-pay-lose.html&quot;&gt;trust&lt;/a&gt; his own people; and he always feels under-informed and shakes when his own boss asks him, “What’s going on?” Because of all this, he uses his people as anti-depressant pills—when they are doing what he says, he feels more secure and stable. A daily stand-up meeting is a great place where he can ask each of us what we’re doing and then tell us what we should do instead. This manager forces us to disclose our personal goals and plans in order to correct them when he feels necessary. How many times have you heard something like this: “&lt;em&gt;I’m planning to test X. … No, next week; today you work with Y&lt;/em&gt;” This is &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/09/22/micromanagement.html&quot;&gt;micro-management&lt;/a&gt;. Daily stand-ups are the perfect tool for a micro-manager.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Good Manager Delegates Responsibility&lt;/strong&gt;. Ideal management involves four steps: 1) Breaking a complex task into smaller sub-tasks; 2) Delegating them to subordinates; 3) Declaring awards, penalties, and rules; and 4) Making sure that awards are generous, penalties are inevitable, and rules are strictly followed. A perfect manager never tells his people what to do every day and how to organize their work time. He trusts and controls. He never humiliates his people by telling them how to do their work. A great manager would say: “&lt;em&gt;You’re planning to test X today? It’s your decision, and I fully respect it. Just remember that if Y isn’t ready by the end of the week, you lose the project, as we agreed.&lt;/em&gt;” Why would such a manager need daily stand-ups? Why would he need to ask his people what they are doing? He is not meddling in their plans. Instead, he trusts them and controls their results only.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Only a good manager is capable of defining awards, penalties, and rules so explicitly and strictly.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;Let me reiterate: I strongly believe that responsibility must be delegated, and this delegation consists of three components: &lt;em&gt;awards, penalties, and rules&lt;/em&gt;. In a modern Western culture, it may be rather difficult to define them—we have long-term contracts and monthly salaries. But a good manager has to find a way. Each task has to be delegated and isolated. This means that the programmer working on the task has to be personally responsible for its success or failure. And he or she has to know the consequences.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A good manager understands that any team member inevitably tries to avoid personal responsibility. Everybody is trying to put a &lt;a href=&quot;http://hbr.org/1999/11/management-time-whos-got-the-monkey/ar/1&quot;&gt;responsibility monkey&lt;/a&gt; back on the shoulders of the manager. It is natural and inevitable. And daily stand-up meetings only help everybody do this trick.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When you ask me in the morning how things are going, I’ll say that there are some problems and I’m not sure that I will be able to finish the task by the end of the week. That’s it! I’m not responsible for the task anymore. It’s not my fault if I fail. I told you that I may fail, remember? From now, the responsibility is yours.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A good manager knows about this trick and prevents it by explicitly defining awards, penalties, and rules. When I tell you that I may fail, you remind me that I’m going to lose my awards and will get penalties instead:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;- I&amp;#39;m not sure I can meet the deadline ... - Sorry to hear that you&amp;#39;re going to lose your $200 weekend bonus because of that :(&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Have you seen many project managers or Scrum masters saying such a thing? Not so many, I believe. Yes, a good manager is a rare creature. But only a good manager is capable of defining awards, penalties, and rules so explicitly and strictly.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When this triangle is defined, nobody needs status update meetings every morning. Everything is clear as it is. We all know our goals and our objectives. We know what will happen if we fail, and we also understand how much we’re going to get if we succeed. We don’t need a manager to remind us about that every morning. And we don’t need a manager to check our progress. He already gave us a very clear definition of our objectives. Why would we talk about them again every morning?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A bad manager isn’t capable of &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/01/26/happy-boss-false-objective.html&quot;&gt;defining objectives&lt;/a&gt;; that’s why he wants to &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/09/22/micromanagement.html&quot;&gt;micro-manage&lt;/a&gt; us every morning. Actually, a bad manager is doing it during the day too. He is afraid that without well-known goals and rules, the team will do something wrong or won’t do anything at all. That’s why he has “to keep his hand on the pulse.” In reality, he keeps his hand on the neck of the team.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;motivation&quot;&gt;Motivation&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Bad Manager De-Motivates by Public Embarrassment&lt;/strong&gt;. He doesn’t know how to organize a proper motivational system within the team; that’s why he relies on a natural fear of public embarrassment. It’s only logical that no one would feel comfortable saying, “&lt;em&gt;I forgot it&lt;/em&gt;” in front of everybody. So the daily stand-up meeting is where he puts everybody in a line and asks, “&lt;em&gt;What did you do yesterday?&lt;/em&gt;” This fearful moment is a great motivator for the team, isn’t it? I don’t think so.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Good Manager Motivates by Objectives&lt;/strong&gt;. Ideal management defines objectives and lets people achieve them using their skills, resources, knowledge, and passion. A properly defined objective always has three components: awards, penalties, and rules. A great manager knows how to translate corporate objectives into personal ones: “&lt;em&gt;If we deliver this feature before the weekend, the company will generate extra profit. You, Sally, will personally get $500. If you fail, you will be moved to another, less interesting project.&lt;/em&gt;” This is a perfectly defined objective. Do we need to ask Sally every morning, in front of everybody, if she forgot to implement the feature? If she is working hard? Will this questioning help her? Absolutely not! She already knows what she is working for, and she is motivated enough. When she finishes on time, organize a meeting and give her a $500 check in front of everybody. This is what a good manager uses meetings for.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;youtube&quot;&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pt9uHp35fwM&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;box&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pt9uHp35fwM/mqdefault.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;YouTube video #pt9uHp35fwM&quot; /&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;play&quot;&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;icon icon-play&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;div&gt;Meetings Or Discipline; 26 April 2016.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;There’s more to this, too, as daily status updates in front of everybody motivate the best team players to backslide and become the same as the worst ones. Well, this is mostly because they don’t want to offend anyone by their super performance. It is in our nature to try to look similar to everybody else while being in a group. When everybody reports, “&lt;em&gt;I still have nothing to show&lt;/em&gt;,” it would be strange to expect a good programmer to say, “&lt;em&gt;I finished all my tasks and want to get more&lt;/em&gt;.” Well, this may happen once, but after a few times, this A player will either stop working hard or will change the team. He will see that his performance is standing out and that this can’t be appreciated by the group, no matter what the manager says.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A good manager understands that each programmer has his or her own speed, quality, and salary. A good manager gives different tasks to different people and expects different results from them. Obviously, lining everybody up in the morning and expecting similar reports from them is a huge mistake. The mistake will have a catastrophic effect on A players, who are interested in achieving super results and expect to be super-appreciated and compensated.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A bad manager can’t manage different people differently, just because he doesn’t know how. That’s why he needs daily stand-ups, where everybody reports almost the same, and it’s easy to compare their results to each other. Also, it’s easier to blame or to cheer up those who don’t report similar to others. In other words, a bad manager uses daily stand-ups as an instrument of equality, which in this case only ruins the entire team’s &lt;a href=&quot;/2017/09/19/what-motivates-me.html&quot;&gt;motivation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;hr /&gt; &lt;p&gt;Daily stand-ups, as well as any status update meetings, are a great instrument to hide and protect a lazy and stupid manager. To hide his inability to manage people. To hide his lack of competence. To hide his fear of problems, challenges, and risks. If you’re a good manager, don’t embarrass yourself with daily stand-ups.&lt;/p&gt; " /> <meta name="keywords" content="next, path, output, content, previous, url, relative_path, id, collection, excerpt, draft, categories, layout, title, date, tags, description, book, keywords, translated, image, jb_picture, slug, ext" /> <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1"/> <meta name="google-site-verification" content="JEj_gQr2CPe2QKGw8XdMz0R7VboQIUbX3FlM-lwTq-8" /> <meta name="author" content="Yegor Bugayenko"> <meta name="article:published_time" content="2015-01-08 00:00:00 +0000"> <meta name="og:site_name" content="Yegor Bugayenko"/> <meta name="og:type" content="article" /> <meta name="og:locale" content="en_US" /> <meta name="twitter:account_id" content="4503599630178231" /> <meta name="twitter:creator" content="@yegor256"/> <meta name="twitter:site" content="@yegor256"/> <meta name="twitter:title" property="og:title" content="Daily Stand-Up Meetings Are a Good Tool for a Bad Manager"/> <meta name="twitter:description" property="og:description" content="&lt;p&gt;A stand-up meeting (or simply “stand-up”) is “a daily team-meeting held to provide a status update to the team members,” according to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stand-up_meeting&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;.

And when someone does stop to tell him something, a good project manager fixes such a broken communication channel. But he never uses daily meetings to collect information.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;youtube&quot;&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dE0_j4Kk6jo&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;box&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dE0_j4Kk6jo/mqdefault.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;YouTube video #dE0_j4Kk6jo&quot; /&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;play&quot;&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;icon icon-play&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;div&gt;Meetings Help Us and Kill Our Projects; 6 April 2016.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;As a &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/09/22/micromanagement.html&quot;&gt;good manager&lt;/a&gt;, inform your team what your goals are and what’s important to you as a project manager (or Scrum master). They should know what’s important for you to know about their progress, risks, impediments, and failures. They should understand what trouble you will get into if they let you down. It is your job, as a good manager, to inform them about the most important issues the project and the team are working through. It’s their job, as a good team, to inform you immediately when they have some important information. This is what perfect management is about.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you manage to organize teamwork like that, you won’t need to wait until the next morning to ask your developers what they were doing yesterday and what problems they experienced. You would have seen this information earlier, exactly when you needed it. You would stay informed about your project affairs even outside of the office. Actually, you would not need an office at all, but that’s a subject for &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/07/21/hourly-pay-modern-slavery.html&quot;&gt;another discussion&lt;/a&gt; :)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;These morning meetings give the impression that the manager is working hard and well deserves his overblown salary.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;Someone may say that daily stand-ups are a perfect place and time to exchange information among programmers, not just to inform the Scrum master and get his feedback. Again, we have the same argument here—why can’t they exchange information when it’s required, during the day? Why do we need to put 10 people together every morning to discuss something that concerns only five of them? I can answer. &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/09/22/micromanagement.html&quot;&gt;Bad managers&lt;/a&gt;, who don’t know how else to organize the exchange of information between team members, use morning stand-ups as a replacement for a correct communication model. These morning meetings give the impression that the manager is working hard and well deserves his overblown salary. To the contrary, a good manager would never have any regular status update meetings, because he knows how to use effective &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/08/23/communication-maturity.html&quot;&gt;communication instruments&lt;/a&gt;, like issue tracking tools, &lt;a href=&quot;/2017/04/18/no-help-via-email.html&quot;&gt;emails&lt;/a&gt;, code reviews, decision-making meetings, pair programming, etc.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;responsibility&quot;&gt;Responsibility&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Bad Manager Micro-Manages&lt;/strong&gt;. This guy knows very little about project management, and that’s why he feels very insecure. He is afraid of losing control of the team; he doesn’t &lt;a href=&quot;/2017/11/21/trust-pay-lose.html&quot;&gt;trust&lt;/a&gt; his own people; and he always feels under-informed and shakes when his own boss asks him, “What’s going on?” Because of all this, he uses his people as anti-depressant pills—when they are doing what he says, he feels more secure and stable. A daily stand-up meeting is a great place where he can ask each of us what we’re doing and then tell us what we should do instead. This manager forces us to disclose our personal goals and plans in order to correct them when he feels necessary. How many times have you heard something like this: “&lt;em&gt;I’m planning to test X. … No, next week; today you work with Y&lt;/em&gt;” This is &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/09/22/micromanagement.html&quot;&gt;micro-management&lt;/a&gt;. Daily stand-ups are the perfect tool for a micro-manager.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Good Manager Delegates Responsibility&lt;/strong&gt;. Ideal management involves four steps: 1) Breaking a complex task into smaller sub-tasks; 2) Delegating them to subordinates; 3) Declaring awards, penalties, and rules; and 4) Making sure that awards are generous, penalties are inevitable, and rules are strictly followed. A perfect manager never tells his people what to do every day and how to organize their work time. He trusts and controls. He never humiliates his people by telling them how to do their work. A great manager would say: “&lt;em&gt;You’re planning to test X today? It’s your decision, and I fully respect it. Just remember that if Y isn’t ready by the end of the week, you lose the project, as we agreed.&lt;/em&gt;” Why would such a manager need daily stand-ups? Why would he need to ask his people what they are doing? He is not meddling in their plans. Instead, he trusts them and controls their results only.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Only a good manager is capable of defining awards, penalties, and rules so explicitly and strictly.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;Let me reiterate: I strongly believe that responsibility must be delegated, and this delegation consists of three components: &lt;em&gt;awards, penalties, and rules&lt;/em&gt;. In a modern Western culture, it may be rather difficult to define them—we have long-term contracts and monthly salaries. But a good manager has to find a way. Each task has to be delegated and isolated. This means that the programmer working on the task has to be personally responsible for its success or failure. And he or she has to know the consequences.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A good manager understands that any team member inevitably tries to avoid personal responsibility. Everybody is trying to put a &lt;a href=&quot;http://hbr.org/1999/11/management-time-whos-got-the-monkey/ar/1&quot;&gt;responsibility monkey&lt;/a&gt; back on the shoulders of the manager. It is natural and inevitable. And daily stand-up meetings only help everybody do this trick.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When you ask me in the morning how things are going, I’ll say that there are some problems and I’m not sure that I will be able to finish the task by the end of the week. That’s it! I’m not responsible for the task anymore. It’s not my fault if I fail. I told you that I may fail, remember? From now, the responsibility is yours.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A good manager knows about this trick and prevents it by explicitly defining awards, penalties, and rules. When I tell you that I may fail, you remind me that I’m going to lose my awards and will get penalties instead:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;- I&amp;#39;m not sure I can meet the deadline ... - Sorry to hear that you&amp;#39;re going to lose your $200 weekend bonus because of that :(&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Have you seen many project managers or Scrum masters saying such a thing? Not so many, I believe. Yes, a good manager is a rare creature. But only a good manager is capable of defining awards, penalties, and rules so explicitly and strictly.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When this triangle is defined, nobody needs status update meetings every morning. Everything is clear as it is. We all know our goals and our objectives. We know what will happen if we fail, and we also understand how much we’re going to get if we succeed. We don’t need a manager to remind us about that every morning. And we don’t need a manager to check our progress. He already gave us a very clear definition of our objectives. Why would we talk about them again every morning?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A bad manager isn’t capable of &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/01/26/happy-boss-false-objective.html&quot;&gt;defining objectives&lt;/a&gt;; that’s why he wants to &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/09/22/micromanagement.html&quot;&gt;micro-manage&lt;/a&gt; us every morning. Actually, a bad manager is doing it during the day too. He is afraid that without well-known goals and rules, the team will do something wrong or won’t do anything at all. That’s why he has “to keep his hand on the pulse.” In reality, he keeps his hand on the neck of the team.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;motivation&quot;&gt;Motivation&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Bad Manager De-Motivates by Public Embarrassment&lt;/strong&gt;. He doesn’t know how to organize a proper motivational system within the team; that’s why he relies on a natural fear of public embarrassment. It’s only logical that no one would feel comfortable saying, “&lt;em&gt;I forgot it&lt;/em&gt;” in front of everybody. So the daily stand-up meeting is where he puts everybody in a line and asks, “&lt;em&gt;What did you do yesterday?&lt;/em&gt;” This fearful moment is a great motivator for the team, isn’t it? I don’t think so.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Good Manager Motivates by Objectives&lt;/strong&gt;. Ideal management defines objectives and lets people achieve them using their skills, resources, knowledge, and passion. A properly defined objective always has three components: awards, penalties, and rules. A great manager knows how to translate corporate objectives into personal ones: “&lt;em&gt;If we deliver this feature before the weekend, the company will generate extra profit. You, Sally, will personally get $500. If you fail, you will be moved to another, less interesting project.&lt;/em&gt;” This is a perfectly defined objective. Do we need to ask Sally every morning, in front of everybody, if she forgot to implement the feature? If she is working hard? Will this questioning help her? Absolutely not! She already knows what she is working for, and she is motivated enough. When she finishes on time, organize a meeting and give her a $500 check in front of everybody. This is what a good manager uses meetings for.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;youtube&quot;&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pt9uHp35fwM&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;box&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pt9uHp35fwM/mqdefault.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;YouTube video #pt9uHp35fwM&quot; /&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;play&quot;&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;icon icon-play&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;div&gt;Meetings Or Discipline; 26 April 2016.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;There’s more to this, too, as daily status updates in front of everybody motivate the best team players to backslide and become the same as the worst ones. Well, this is mostly because they don’t want to offend anyone by their super performance. It is in our nature to try to look similar to everybody else while being in a group. When everybody reports, “&lt;em&gt;I still have nothing to show&lt;/em&gt;,” it would be strange to expect a good programmer to say, “&lt;em&gt;I finished all my tasks and want to get more&lt;/em&gt;.” Well, this may happen once, but after a few times, this A player will either stop working hard or will change the team. He will see that his performance is standing out and that this can’t be appreciated by the group, no matter what the manager says.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A good manager understands that each programmer has his or her own speed, quality, and salary. A good manager gives different tasks to different people and expects different results from them. Obviously, lining everybody up in the morning and expecting similar reports from them is a huge mistake. The mistake will have a catastrophic effect on A players, who are interested in achieving super results and expect to be super-appreciated and compensated.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A bad manager can’t manage different people differently, just because he doesn’t know how. That’s why he needs daily stand-ups, where everybody reports almost the same, and it’s easy to compare their results to each other. Also, it’s easier to blame or to cheer up those who don’t report similar to others. In other words, a bad manager uses daily stand-ups as an instrument of equality, which in this case only ruins the entire team’s &lt;a href=&quot;/2017/09/19/what-motivates-me.html&quot;&gt;motivation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;hr /&gt; &lt;p&gt;Daily stand-ups, as well as any status update meetings, are a great instrument to hide and protect a lazy and stupid manager. To hide his inability to manage people. To hide his lack of competence. To hide his fear of problems, challenges, and risks. If you’re a good manager, don’t embarrass yourself with daily stand-ups.&lt;/p&gt; "/> <meta name="twitter:url" property="og:url"

class="unprintable"><p>A stand-up meeting (or simply “stand-up”) is “a daily team-meeting held to provide a status update to the team members,” according to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stand-up_meeting">Wikipedia</a>. In the next few paragraphs, I attempt to explain why these meetings, despite being so popular in software development teams, are <em>pure evil</em> and should never be used by good <a href="/2015/09/22/micromanagement.html">managers</a>.</p><p>I’m not saying they can be done right or wrong; there are plenty of articles about that. I’m not trying to give advice about how to do them properly so they work, either. I’m saying that a good manager should <em>never</em> have daily stand-ups. Because they not only “don’t work” but also do very bad, sometimes catastrophic, things to your management process, whether it’s <a href="/2015/11/21/ringelmann-effect-vs-agile.html">agile</a> or not. On the other hand, a <a href="/2015/09/22/micromanagement.html">bad manager</a> will always use daily stand-ups as his or her key management instrument.</p><figure class="jb_picture"><img itemprop="image" alt="Cool Hand Luke (1967) by Stuart Rosenberg" src="/images/2015/01/cool-hand-luke.png" longdesc="#fdaa01b7" /><figcaption id="fdaa01b7">Cool Hand Luke (1967) by Stuart Rosenberg</figcaption></figure><p>To explain what I mean, let’s look at management from a few different angles and compare how good and bad managers would organize their work.</p><h2 id="information">Information</h2><p><strong>A Bad Manager Asks How Things Are Going</strong>. Strolling around the <a href="/2015/10/06/how-to-be-good-office-slave.html">office</a> asking how things are going is a great habit of a terrible manager. He doesn’t know what his team is doing because he is not smart enough to organize the process and information flow correctly. However, he needs to know what’s going on because his boss is also asking him from time to time. So the only way to collect the required information is to ask the team, “What are you working on right now?” Morning stand-up is a perfect place to ask this annoying question officially without being marked as a manager who doesn’t know what he is doing.</p><aside class="youtube"> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibT5oKToMoQ"><div class="box"> <img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ibT5oKToMoQ/mqdefault.jpg" alt="YouTube video #ibT5oKToMoQ" /><div class="play"><i class="icon icon-play"></i></div></div></a><div>Daily Stand-Up Meetings Are Evil (webinar #11); 3 February 2016.</div></aside><p><strong>A Good Manager Is Being Told When Necessary</strong>. Managing a project involves management of communications. When information flows are organized correctly, every team member knows when and how he or she has to report to the manager. When something goes wrong, everybody knows how such a situation has to be reported: immediately and directly. When a backlog task is completed, everybody understands how to inform a project manager if he needs this information. A <a href="/2016/05/24/who-is-project-manager.html">perfect project manager</a> never asks his people. Instead, they tell him when necessary. And when someone does stop to tell him something, a good project manager fixes such a broken communication channel.

Again, we have the same argument here—why can’t they exchange information when it’s required, during the day? Why do we need to put 10 people together every morning to discuss something that concerns only five of them? I can answer. <a href="/2015/09/22/micromanagement.html">Bad managers</a>, who don’t know how else to organize the exchange of information between team members, use morning stand-ups as a replacement for a correct communication model. These morning meetings give the impression that the manager is working hard and well deserves his overblown salary. To the contrary, a good manager would never have any regular status update meetings, because he knows how to use effective <a href="/2016/08/23/communication-maturity.html">communication instruments</a>, like issue tracking tools, <a href="/2017/04/18/no-help-via-email.html">emails</a>, code reviews, decision-making meetings, pair programming, etc.</p><h2 id="responsibility">Responsibility</h2><p><strong>A Bad Manager Micro-Manages</strong>. This guy knows very little about project management, and that’s why he feels very insecure. He is afraid of losing control of the team; he doesn’t <a href="/2017/11/21/trust-pay-lose.html">trust</a> his own people; and he always feels under-informed and shakes when his own boss asks him, “What’s going on?” Because of all this, he uses his people as anti-depressant pills—when they are doing what he says, he feels more secure and stable. A daily stand-up meeting is a great place where he can ask each of us what we’re doing and then tell us what we should do instead. This manager forces us to disclose our personal goals and plans in order to correct them when he feels necessary. How many times have you heard something like this: “<em>I’m planning to test X. … No, next week; today you work with Y</em>” This is <a href="/2015/09/22/micromanagement.html">micro-management</a>. Daily stand-ups are the perfect tool for a micro-manager.</p><p><strong>A Good Manager Delegates Responsibility</strong>. Ideal management involves four steps: 1) Breaking a complex task into smaller sub-tasks; 2) Delegating them to subordinates; 3) Declaring awards, penalties, and rules; and 4) Making sure that awards are generous, penalties are inevitable, and rules are strictly followed. A perfect manager never tells his people what to do every day and how to organize their work time. He trusts and controls. He never humiliates his people by telling them how to do their work. A great manager would say: “<em>You’re planning to test X today? It’s your decision, and I fully respect it. Just remember that if Y isn’t ready by the end of the week, you lose the project, as we agreed.</em>” Why would such a manager need daily stand-ups? Why would he need to ask his people what they are doing? He is not meddling in their plans. Instead, he trusts them and controls their results only.</p><aside class="quote">Only a good manager is capable of defining awards, penalties, and rules so explicitly and strictly.</aside><p>Let me reiterate: I strongly believe that responsibility must be delegated, and this delegation consists of three components: <em>awards, penalties, and rules</em>. In a modern Western culture, it may be rather difficult to define them—we have long-term contracts and monthly salaries. But a good manager has to find a way.

Actually, a bad manager is doing it during the day too. He is afraid that without well-known goals and rules, the team will do something wrong or won’t do anything at all.

He doesn’t know how to organize a proper motivational system within the team; that’s why he relies on a natural fear of public embarrassment. It’s only logical that no one would feel comfortable saying, “<em>I forgot it</em>” in front of everybody. So the daily stand-up meeting is where he puts everybody in a line and asks, “<em>What did you do yesterday?</em>” This fearful moment is a great motivator for the team, isn’t it? I don’t think so.</p><p><strong>A Good Manager Motivates by Objectives</strong>. Ideal management defines objectives and lets people achieve them using their skills, resources, knowledge, and passion. A properly defined objective always has three components: awards, penalties, and rules. A great manager knows how to translate corporate objectives into personal ones: “<em>If we deliver this feature before the weekend, the company will generate extra profit. You, Sally, will personally get $500. If you fail, you will be moved to another, less interesting project.</em>” This is a perfectly defined objective. Do we need to ask Sally every morning, in front of everybody, if she forgot to implement the feature? If she is working hard? Will this questioning help her? Absolutely not! She already knows what she is working for, and she is motivated enough. When she finishes on time, organize a meeting and give her a $500 check in front of everybody. This is what a good manager uses meetings for.</p><aside class="youtube"> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pt9uHp35fwM"><div class="box"> <img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pt9uHp35fwM/mqdefault.jpg" alt="YouTube video #pt9uHp35fwM" /><div class="play"><i class="icon icon-play"></i></div></div></a><div>Meetings Or Discipline; 26 April 2016.</div></aside><p>There’s more to this, too, as daily status updates in front of everybody motivate the best team players to backslide and become the same as the worst ones. Well, this is mostly because they don’t want to offend anyone by their super performance. It is in our nature to try to look similar to everybody else while being in a group. When everybody reports, “<em>I still have nothing to show</em>,” it would be strange to expect a good programmer to say, “<em>I finished all my tasks and want to get more</em>.” Well, this may happen once, but after a few times, this A player will either stop working hard or will change the team.

In the next few paragraphs, I attempt to explain why these meetings, despite being so popular in software development teams, are <em>pure evil</em> and should never be used by good <a href="/2015/09/22/micromanagement.html">managers</a>.</p><p>I’m not saying they can be done right or wrong; there are plenty of articles about that. I’m not trying to give advice about how to do them properly so they work, either. I’m saying that a good manager should <em>never</em> have daily stand-ups. Because they not only “don’t work” but also do very bad, sometimes catastrophic, things to your management process, whether it’s <a href="/2015/11/21/ringelmann-effect-vs-agile.html">agile</a> or not.

Strolling around the <a href="/2015/10/06/how-to-be-good-office-slave.html">office</a> asking how things are going is a great habit of a terrible manager. He doesn’t know what his team is doing because he is not smart enough to organize the process and information flow correctly. However, he needs to know what’s going on because his boss is also asking him from time to time. So the only way to collect the required information is to ask the team, “What are you working on right now?” Morning stand-up is a perfect place to ask this annoying question officially without being marked as a manager who doesn’t know what he is doing.</p><aside class="youtube"> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibT5oKToMoQ"><div class="box"> <img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ibT5oKToMoQ/mqdefault.jpg" alt="YouTube video #ibT5oKToMoQ" /><div class="play"><i class="icon icon-play"></i></div></div></a><div>Daily Stand-Up Meetings Are Evil (webinar #11); 3 February 2016.</div></aside><p><strong>A Good Manager Is Being Told When Necessary</strong>. Managing a project involves management of communications. When information flows are organized correctly, every team member knows when and how he or she has to report to the manager. When something goes wrong, everybody knows how such a situation has to be reported: immediately and directly. When a backlog task is completed, everybody understands how to inform a project manager if he needs this information. A <a href="/2016/05/24/who-is-project-manager.html">perfect project manager</a> never asks his people. Instead, they tell him when necessary. And when someone does stop to tell him something, a good project manager fixes such a broken communication channel.

If you’re a good manager, don’t embarrass yourself with daily stand-ups.</p></div></article></div><div class="wrapper"> <related-posts /></div><div class="disqus" role="complementary"><p class="disqus_hint"> Please, use <a href="https://help.disqus.com/commenting/what-html-tags-are-allowed-within-comments">syntax highlighting</a> in your comments, to make them more readable.</p><div id="disqus_thread" class="disqus-thread"> <a>&nbsp;</a></div><script> var disqus_config = function () { this.page.url = document.location.href.split('?')[0].split('#')[0].replace('https://', 'http://'); this.page.identifier = this.page.url; }; (function() { var d = document, s = d.createElement('script'); s.src = '//yegor256.disqus.com/embed.js'; s.setAttribute('data-timestamp', +new Date()); (d.head || d.body).appendChild(s); })(); </script> <noscript><div><p class="red"> JavaScript is disabled in your browser, that's why you can't see comments under this post.</p></div></noscript></div><div class="wrapper"> <footer class="footer"><p> &copy; <span itemscope="" itemprop="copyrightHolder" itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"> <span itemprop="name">Yegor Bugayenko</span> </span> 2014&ndash;<span itemprop="copyrightYear">2018</span></p></footer></div></section><div class="wrapper unprintable" style="text-align:center;margin-top:2em;"> <a href="http://www.sixnines.io/h/3ba1652f"> <img src="//www.sixnines.io/b/3ba1652f?style=flat" alt="sixnines availability badge"/> </a></div><script src="//code.jquery.com/jquery-1.9.0.min.js"></script> <script src="/js/all.js?c998b88f617"></script> <script>var disqus_shortname = 'yegor256';</script> <script id="dsq-count-scr" src="//yegor256.disqus.com/count.js" async="async"></script> <script> (function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){ (i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o), m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m) })(window,document,'script','//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga'); ga('create', 'UA-1963507-32', 'auto'); ga('send', 'pageview'); </script> <script> Cd=document;Cr="&"+Math.random();Cp="&s=1"; Cd.cookie="b=b";if(Cd.cookie)Cp+="&c=1"; Cp+="&t="+(new Date()).getTimezoneOffset(); if(self!=top)Cp+="&f=1"; </script> <script> if(navigator.javaEnabled())Cp+="&j=1"; </script> <script> if(typeof(screen)!='undefined')Cp+="&w="+screen.width+"&h="+ screen.height+"&d="+(screen.colorDepth?screen.colorDepth:screen.pixelDepth); </script> <script> Cd.write("<img src='//c.hit.ua/hit?i=95870&g=0&x=2"+Cp+Cr+ "&r="+escape(Cd.referrer)+"&u="+escape(window.location.href)+ "' border='0' wi"+"dth='1' he"+"ight='1'/>"); </script> <script type="application/ld+json"> { "@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Person", "name": "Yegor Bugayenko", "url": "https://www.yegor256.com", "sameAs": [ "https://www.facebook.com/yegor256", "https://instagram.com/yegor256", "https://www.linkedin.com/in/yegor256", "https://twitter.com/yegor256", "https://github.com/yegor256", "https://www.pinterest.com/yegor256/" ] } </script> </body> </html> <!DOCTYPE html> <html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/WebSite"> <head> <meta charset="utf-8"/> <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Most of our &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/01/26/happy-boss-false-objective.html&quot;&gt;clients&lt;/a&gt; are rather surprised when we explain to them that they will have full access to the source code from the first day of the project. We let them see everything that is happening in the project, including the Git repository, &lt;a href=&quot;/2018/04/24/right-way-to-report-bugs.html&quot;&gt;bug reports&lt;/a&gt;, discussions between programmers, &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/10/08/continuous-integration-is-dead.html&quot;&gt;continuous integration&lt;/a&gt; fails, etc. They often tell me that other software development &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/10/27/outsourcing-doesnt-work.html&quot;&gt;outsourcing teams&lt;/a&gt; keep this information in-house and deliver only final releases, rarely together with the source code.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I understand why other developers are trying to hide as much as possible. Giving a project sponsor full access to the development environment is &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/05/21/avoid-software-outsourcing-disaster.html&quot;&gt;not easy&lt;/a&gt; at all.

I hope they help you honestly show your clients all project internals and still keep them on board.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;!--more--&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;jb_picture&quot;&gt;&lt;img itemprop=&quot;image&quot; alt=&quot;99 francs (2007) by Jan Kounen&quot; src=&quot;/images/2014/12/99-francs.png&quot; longdesc=&quot;#822a28fd&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption id=&quot;822a28fd&quot;&gt;99 francs (2007) by Jan Kounen&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;he-is-breaking-our-process&quot;&gt;He Is Breaking Our Process&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is the most popular problem we face with our new clients. Once they gain access to the development environment, they try to give instructions directly to programmers, walking around &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/10/06/software-project-lifecycle.html&quot;&gt;our existing process&lt;/a&gt;. “I’m paying these guys; why can’t I tell them what to do?” is a very typical mindset. Instead of submitting requests through our standard change management mechanism, such a client goes directly to one of the programmers and tells him what should be fixed, how, and when. It’s &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/09/22/micromanagement.html&quot;&gt;micro-management&lt;/a&gt; in its worst form. We see it very often. What do we do?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;The simplest answer is that the client is a moron. Sometimes this is exactly the case, but it's a rare one.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;First, we try to understand why it’s happening. The simplest answer is that the client is a moron. Sometimes this is exactly the case, but it’s a rare one. Much more often, our clients are not that bad. What is it, then? Why can’t they follow the process and abide by the rules? There are a few possible reasons.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Maybe the &lt;strong&gt;rules are not explained well&lt;/strong&gt;. This is the most popular root cause—the rules of work are not clear enough for the client. He just doesn’t know what he is supposed to do in order to submit a request and get it implemented. To prevent this, we try to educate our clients at the beginning of a new project. We even write guidance manuals for clients. Most of them are happy to read them and learn the way we work, because they understand that this is the best way to achieve success while working with us.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;youtube&quot;&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rip_04Bv3Jk&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;box&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Rip_04Bv3Jk/mqdefault.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;YouTube video #Rip_04Bv3Jk&quot; /&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;play&quot;&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;icon icon-play&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;div&gt;How to be Honest and Keep a Client?; 11 June 2017.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;Maybe our &lt;strong&gt;management is chaotic&lt;/strong&gt;, and the client is trying to “organize” us by giving explicit instructions regarding the most important tasks. We’ve seen it before, and we are always trying to learn from this. As soon as we see that the client is trying to &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/09/22/micromanagement.html&quot;&gt;micro-manage&lt;/a&gt; us, we ask ourselves: “Is our process transparent enough? Do we give enough information to the client about milestones, risks, plans, &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/06/02/how-to-estimate-software-cost.html&quot;&gt;costs&lt;/a&gt;, etc.?” In most cases, it’s our own fault, and we’re trying to learn and improve. If so, it’s important to react fast, before the client becomes too aggressive in his orders and instructions. It will be very difficult to escort him back to the normal process once he gets “micro-management” in his blood.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Maybe the client is not busy enough and has &lt;strong&gt;a lot of free time&lt;/strong&gt;, which he is happy to spend by giving orders and distracting your team. I’ve seen this many times. A solution? Keep him busy. Turn him into a member of the team and assign him some tasks related to documentation and research. In my experience, most clients would be happy to do this work and help the project.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;he-is-asking-too-much&quot;&gt;He Is Asking Too Much&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;A technically-savvy client can turn the life of &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/10/12/who-is-software-architect.html&quot;&gt;an architect&lt;/a&gt; into a nightmare by constantly asking him to explain every single technical decision made, from “Why PostgreSQL instead of MySQL?” to “Why doesn’t this method throw a checked exception?” Constantly answering such questions can turn a project into a school of programming. Even though he is paying for our time, that doesn’t mean we should teach him how to develop software, right? On the other hand, he is interested in knowing how &lt;em&gt;his&lt;/em&gt; software is developed and how it works. It’s a fair request, isn’t it?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;He is interested in knowing how his software is developed and how it works. It's a fair request, isn't it?&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;I believe there is a &lt;em&gt;win-win&lt;/em&gt; solution to this problem. Here is how we manage it. First of all, we make all his requests formal. We ask a client to create a new ticket for each request, properly explaining what is not clear and how much detail is expected in the explanation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Second, we look at such requests positively—they are good indicators of certain inconsistencies in the software. If it’s not clear for the client why PostgreSQL is used and not MySQL, it’s a fault of &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/10/12/who-is-software-architect.html&quot;&gt;our architect&lt;/a&gt;. He didn’t document his decision and didn’t explain how it was made, what other options were considered, what selection criteria were applied, etc. Thus, a request from a client is &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/04/13/bugs-are-welcome.html&quot;&gt;a bug&lt;/a&gt; we get for free. So, we look at it positively.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Finally, we charge our clients for the answers given. Every question, submitted as a ticket, goes through the full flow and &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/10/21/incremental-billing.html&quot;&gt;gets billed&lt;/a&gt; just as any other ticket. This approach prevents the client from asking for too much. He realizes that we’re ready to explain anything he wants, but he will pay for it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;he-is-telling-too-much&quot;&gt;He Is Telling Too Much&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;This problem is even bigger than the previous one. Some clients believe they are savvy enough to argue with &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/10/12/who-is-software-architect.html&quot;&gt;our architect&lt;/a&gt; and our programmers about how the software should be developed. They don’t just ask why PostgreSQL is used, they tell us that we should use MySQL, because “I know that it’s a great database; my friend is using it, and his business is growing!” Sometimes it gets even worse, when suggestions are directed at every class or even a method, like “You should use a Singleton pattern here!”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Our first choice is to agree and do what he wants. But it’s a road to nowhere. Once you do it, your project is ruined, and you should start thinking about a divorce with this client. Your entire team will quickly turn into a group of coding monkeys, &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/09/22/micromanagement.html&quot;&gt;micro-managed&lt;/a&gt; by someone with some cash. It’s a very wrong direction; don’t even think about going there.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The second choice is to tell the client to mind his own business and let us do ours. He &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/06/21/how-to-hire-programmer.html&quot;&gt;hired&lt;/a&gt; us because we’re professional enough to develop the software according to his requirements. If he questions our capabilities, he is free to &lt;strong&gt;change&lt;/strong&gt; the contractor. But until then, he has to &lt;a href=&quot;/2017/11/21/trust-pay-lose.html&quot;&gt;trust&lt;/a&gt; our decisions. Will this work? I doubt it. It’s the same as giving him the finger. He will get offended, and you won’t get anything.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The solution here is to turn the client’s demands into project requirements. Most of them will be lost in the process, because they won’t be sane enough to form a good requirement. Others will be documented, estimated, and crossed-out by the client himself, because he will realize they are pointless or too expensive. Only a few of them will survive, since they will be reasonable enough. And they will help the project. So it is also a &lt;em&gt;win-win&lt;/em&gt; solution.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Never take a client's demands directly to execution, but rather use them first to amend the requirements documentation.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;For example, he says that “you should use MySQL because it’s great.” You tell him that the project requirements document doesn’t limit you to choose whichever database you like. Should it? He says yes, of course! OK, let’s try to document such a requirement. How will it sound? How about, “We should only use great databases?” Sound correct? If so, then PostgreSQL satisfies this requirement. Problem solved; let us continue to do our work. He will have a hard time figuring out how to write a requirement in a way that disallows PostgreSQL but allows MySQL. It is simply not possible in most cases.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sometimes, though, it will make sense; for example, “We should use a database server that understands our legacy data in MySQL format.” This is a perfectly sane requirement, and the only way to satisfy it is to use MySQL.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thus, my recommendation is to never take a client’s demands directly to execution, but rather use them first to amend the requirements documentation. Even if you don’t have such documentation, create a simple one-page document. Agree with the client that you work against this document, and when anyone wants to change something, you first have to amend the document and then have your team ensure the software satisfies it. This kind of discipline will be accepted by any client and will protect you against sudden and distracting corrections.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;he-is-questioning-our-skills&quot;&gt;He Is Questioning Our Skills&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;When source code is open to the client, and he is technically capable of reading it, it is very possible that one day he will tell us that our code is crap and we have to learn how to program better. It has not happened in our projects for many years, but it has happened before, when we weren’t using static analysis as a &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/08/13/strict-code-quality-control.html&quot;&gt;mandatory step&lt;/a&gt; in our &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/10/08/continuous-integration-is-dead.html&quot;&gt;continuous integration&lt;/a&gt; pipeline.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Another funny possibility is when the client shows the source code to a “friend,” and he gives a “professional” opinion, which sounds like, “They don’t know what they are doing.” Once such an opinion hits your client’s ears, the project is at a significant risk of closure. It’ll be very difficult, almost impossible, to convince the client not to listen to the “friend” and continue to work with you. That’s why most &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/10/27/outsourcing-doesnt-work.html&quot;&gt;outsourcers&lt;/a&gt; prefer to keep their sources private until the very end of the project, when the final invoice is paid.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;No matter how beautiful your architecture and your source code is, the &quot;friend&quot; will always be right.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;I think that an accidental appearance of a “friend” with a negative opinion is un-preventable. If it happens, it happens. You can’t avoid it. On the other hand, if you think your code is perfect and your team has only talented programmers writing beautiful software, this is not going to protect you either. An opinion coming from a “friend” won’t be objective; it will just be very personal, and that’s why it’s very credible. He is a friend of a client, and he doesn’t send him bills every week. Why would he lie? Of course, he is speaking from the heart! (I’m being sarcastic.) So, no matter how beautiful your architecture and your source code is, the “friend” will always be right.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In my opinion, the only way to prevent such a situation or minimize its consequences is to organize regular and systematic &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/12/18/independent-technical-reviews.html&quot;&gt;independent technical reviews&lt;/a&gt;. They will give confidence to the client that the team is not lying to him about the quality of the product and key technical decisions made internally.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;hr /&gt; &lt;p&gt;To conclude, I strongly believe it is important to be honest and open with each client, no matter how difficult it is. Try to learn from every &lt;a href=&quot;/2017/01/03/how-much-you-love-conflicts.html&quot;&gt;conflict&lt;/a&gt; with each client, and improve your management process and your principles of work. Hiding source code is not professional and makes you look bad in the eyes of your clients and the entire industry.&lt;/p&gt; " /> <meta name="keywords" content="next, path, output, content, previous, url, relative_path, id, collection, excerpt, draft, categories, layout, title, date, tags, description, keywords, social, image, jb_picture, slug, ext" /> <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1"/> <meta name="google-site-verification" content="JEj_gQr2CPe2QKGw8XdMz0R7VboQIUbX3FlM-lwTq-8" /> <meta name="author" content="Yegor Bugayenko"> <meta name="article:published_time" content="2015-01-05 00:00:00 +0000"> <meta name="og:site_name" content="Yegor Bugayenko"/> <meta name="og:type" content="article" /> <meta name="og:locale" content="en_US" /> <meta name="twitter:account_id" content="4503599630178231" /> <meta name="twitter:creator" content="@yegor256"/> <meta name="twitter:site" content="@yegor256"/> <meta name="twitter:title" property="og:title" content="How to Be Honest and Keep a Customer"/> <meta name="twitter:description" property="og:description" content="&lt;p&gt;Most of our &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/01/26/happy-boss-false-objective.html&quot;&gt;clients&lt;/a&gt; are rather surprised when we explain to them that they will have full access to the source code from the first day of the project.

This approach prevents the client from asking for too much. He realizes that we’re ready to explain anything he wants, but he will pay for it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;he-is-telling-too-much&quot;&gt;He Is Telling Too Much&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;This problem is even bigger than the previous one. Some clients believe they are savvy enough to argue with &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/10/12/who-is-software-architect.html&quot;&gt;our architect&lt;/a&gt; and our programmers about how the software should be developed. They don’t just ask why PostgreSQL is used, they tell us that we should use MySQL, because “I know that it’s a great database; my friend is using it, and his business is growing!” Sometimes it gets even worse, when suggestions are directed at every class or even a method, like “You should use a Singleton pattern here!”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Our first choice is to agree and do what he wants. But it’s a road to nowhere. Once you do it, your project is ruined, and you should start thinking about a divorce with this client. Your entire team will quickly turn into a group of coding monkeys, &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/09/22/micromanagement.html&quot;&gt;micro-managed&lt;/a&gt; by someone with some cash. It’s a very wrong direction; don’t even think about going there.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The second choice is to tell the client to mind his own business and let us do ours. He &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/06/21/how-to-hire-programmer.html&quot;&gt;hired&lt;/a&gt; us because we’re professional enough to develop the software according to his requirements. If he questions our capabilities, he is free to &lt;strong&gt;change&lt;/strong&gt; the contractor. But until then, he has to &lt;a href=&quot;/2017/11/21/trust-pay-lose.html&quot;&gt;trust&lt;/a&gt; our decisions. Will this work? I doubt it. It’s the same as giving him the finger. He will get offended, and you won’t get anything.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The solution here is to turn the client’s demands into project requirements. Most of them will be lost in the process, because they won’t be sane enough to form a good requirement. Others will be documented, estimated, and crossed-out by the client himself, because he will realize they are pointless or too expensive. Only a few of them will survive, since they will be reasonable enough. And they will help the project. So it is also a &lt;em&gt;win-win&lt;/em&gt; solution.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Never take a client's demands directly to execution, but rather use them first to amend the requirements documentation.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;For example, he says that “you should use MySQL because it’s great.” You tell him that the project requirements document doesn’t limit you to choose whichever database you like. Should it? He says yes, of course! OK, let’s try to document such a requirement. How will it sound? How about, “We should only use great databases?” Sound correct? If so, then PostgreSQL satisfies this requirement. Problem solved; let us continue to do our work. He will have a hard time figuring out how to write a requirement in a way that disallows PostgreSQL but allows MySQL. It is simply not possible in most cases.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sometimes, though, it will make sense; for example, “We should use a database server that understands our legacy data in MySQL format.” This is a perfectly sane requirement, and the only way to satisfy it is to use MySQL.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thus, my recommendation is to never take a client’s demands directly to execution, but rather use them first to amend the requirements documentation. Even if you don’t have such documentation, create a simple one-page document. Agree with the client that you work against this document, and when anyone wants to change something, you first have to amend the document and then have your team ensure the software satisfies it. This kind of discipline will be accepted by any client and will protect you against sudden and distracting corrections.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;he-is-questioning-our-skills&quot;&gt;He Is Questioning Our Skills&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;When source code is open to the client, and he is technically capable of reading it, it is very possible that one day he will tell us that our code is crap and we have to learn how to program better. It has not happened in our projects for many years, but it has happened before, when we weren’t using static analysis as a &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/08/13/strict-code-quality-control.html&quot;&gt;mandatory step&lt;/a&gt; in our &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/10/08/continuous-integration-is-dead.html&quot;&gt;continuous integration&lt;/a&gt; pipeline.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Another funny possibility is when the client shows the source code to a “friend,” and he gives a “professional” opinion, which sounds like, “They don’t know what they are doing.” Once such an opinion hits your client’s ears, the project is at a significant risk of closure. It’ll be very difficult, almost impossible, to convince the client not to listen to the “friend” and continue to work with you. That’s why most &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/10/27/outsourcing-doesnt-work.html&quot;&gt;outsourcers&lt;/a&gt; prefer to keep their sources private until the very end of the project, when the final invoice is paid.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;No matter how beautiful your architecture and your source code is, the &quot;friend&quot; will always be right.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;I think that an accidental appearance of a “friend” with a negative opinion is un-preventable. If it happens, it happens. You can’t avoid it. On the other hand, if you think your code is perfect and your team has only talented programmers writing beautiful software, this is not going to protect you either. An opinion coming from a “friend” won’t be objective; it will just be very personal, and that’s why it’s very credible. He is a friend of a client, and he doesn’t send him bills every week. Why would he lie? Of course, he is speaking from the heart! (I’m being sarcastic.) So, no matter how beautiful your architecture and your source code is, the “friend” will always be right.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In my opinion, the only way to prevent such a situation or minimize its consequences is to organize regular and systematic &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/12/18/independent-technical-reviews.html&quot;&gt;independent technical reviews&lt;/a&gt;. They will give confidence to the client that the team is not lying to him about the quality of the product and key technical decisions made internally.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;hr /&gt; &lt;p&gt;To conclude, I strongly believe it is important to be honest and open with each client, no matter how difficult it is. Try to learn from every &lt;a href=&quot;/2017/01/03/how-much-you-love-conflicts.html&quot;&gt;conflict&lt;/a&gt; with each client, and improve your management process and your principles of work. Hiding source code is not professional and makes you look bad in the eyes of your clients and the entire industry.&lt;/p&gt; "/> <meta name="twitter:url" property="og:url"

href="/2015/01/26/happy-boss-false-objective.html">clients</a> are rather surprised when we explain to them that they will have full access to the source code from the first day of the project. We let them see everything that is happening in the project, including the Git repository, <a href="/2018/04/24/right-way-to-report-bugs.html">bug reports</a>, discussions between programmers, <a href="/2014/10/08/continuous-integration-is-dead.html">continuous integration</a> fails, etc. They often tell me that other software development <a href="/2015/10/27/outsourcing-doesnt-work.html">outsourcing teams</a> keep this information in-house and deliver only final releases, rarely together with the source code.</p><p>I understand why other developers are trying to hide as much as possible. Giving a project sponsor full access to the development environment is <a href="/2015/05/21/avoid-software-outsourcing-disaster.html">not easy</a> at all. Here is a summary of problems we’ve been having and our solutions. I hope they help you honestly show your clients all project internals and still keep them on board.</p><figure class="jb_picture"><img itemprop="image" alt="99 francs (2007) by Jan Kounen" src="/images/2014/12/99-francs.png" longdesc="#822a28fd" /><figcaption id="822a28fd">99 francs (2007) by Jan Kounen</figcaption></figure><h2 id="he-is-breaking-our-process">He Is Breaking Our Process</h2><p>This is the most popular problem we face with our new clients. Once they gain access to the development environment, they try to give instructions directly to programmers, walking around <a href="/2014/10/06/software-project-lifecycle.html">our existing process</a>. “I’m paying these guys; why can’t I tell them what to do?” is a very typical mindset. Instead of submitting requests through our standard change management mechanism, such a client goes directly to one of the programmers and tells him what should be fixed, how, and when. It’s <a href="/2015/09/22/micromanagement.html">micro-management</a> in its worst form. We see it very often. What do we do?</p><aside class="quote">The simplest answer is that the client is a moron. Sometimes this is exactly the case, but it's a rare one.</aside><p>First, we try to understand why it’s happening. The simplest answer is that the client is a moron. Sometimes this is exactly the case, but it’s a rare one. Much more often, our clients are not that bad. What is it, then? Why can’t they follow the process and abide by the rules? There are a few possible reasons.</p><p>Maybe the <strong>rules are not explained well</strong>. This is the most popular root cause—the rules of work are not clear enough for the client. He just doesn’t know what he is supposed to do in order to submit a request and get it implemented. To prevent this, we try to educate our clients at the beginning of a new project. We even write guidance manuals for clients. Most of them are happy to read them and learn the way we work, because they understand that this is the best way to achieve success while working with us.</p><aside class="youtube"> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rip_04Bv3Jk"><div class="box"> <img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Rip_04Bv3Jk/mqdefault.jpg" alt="YouTube video #Rip_04Bv3Jk" /><div class="play"><i class="icon icon-play"></i></div></div></a><div>How to be Honest and Keep a Client?; 11 June 2017.</div></aside><p>Maybe our <strong>management is chaotic</strong>, and the client is trying to “organize” us by giving explicit instructions regarding the most important tasks. We’ve seen it before, and we are always trying to learn from this. As soon as we see that the client is trying to <a href="/2015/09/22/micromanagement.html">micro-manage</a> us, we ask ourselves: “Is our process transparent enough? Do we give enough information to the client about milestones, risks, plans, <a href="/2015/06/02/how-to-estimate-software-cost.html">costs</a>, etc.?” In most cases, it’s our own fault, and we’re trying to learn and improve. If so, it’s important to react fast, before the client becomes too aggressive in his orders and instructions. It will be very difficult to escort him back to the normal process once he gets “micro-management” in his blood.</p><p>Maybe the client is not busy enough and has <strong>a lot of free time</strong>, which he is happy to spend by giving orders and distracting your team. I’ve seen this many times. A solution? Keep him busy. Turn him into a member of the team and assign him some tasks related to documentation and research. In my experience, most clients would be happy to do this work and help the project.</p><h2 id="he-is-asking-too-much">He Is Asking Too Much</h2><p>A technically-savvy client can turn the life of <a href="/2014/10/12/who-is-software-architect.html">an architect</a> into a nightmare by constantly asking him to explain every single technical decision made, from “Why PostgreSQL instead of MySQL?” to “Why doesn’t this method throw a checked exception?” Constantly answering such questions can turn a project into a school of programming. Even though he is paying for our time, that doesn’t mean we should teach him how to develop software, right? On the other hand, he is interested in knowing how <em>his</em> software is developed and how it works. It’s a fair request, isn’t it?</p><aside class="quote">He is interested in knowing how his software is developed and how it works. It's a fair request, isn't it?</aside><p>I believe there is a <em>win-win</em> solution to this problem. Here is how we manage it. First of all, we make all his requests formal. We ask a client to create a new ticket for each request, properly explaining what is not clear and how much detail is expected in the explanation.</p><p>Second, we look at such requests positively—they are good indicators of certain inconsistencies in the software. If it’s not clear for the client why PostgreSQL is used and not MySQL, it’s a fault of <a href="/2014/10/12/who-is-software-architect.html">our architect</a>. He didn’t document his decision and didn’t explain how it was made, what other options were considered, what selection criteria were applied, etc. Thus, a request from a client is <a href="/2014/04/13/bugs-are-welcome.html">a bug</a> we get for free. So, we look at it positively.</p><p>Finally, we charge our clients for the answers given.

An opinion coming from a “friend” won’t be objective; it will just be very personal, and that’s why it’s very credible. He is a friend of a client, and he doesn’t send him bills every week. Why would he lie? Of course, he is speaking from the heart! (I’m being sarcastic.)

I hope they help you honestly show your clients all project internals and still keep them on board.</p><figure class="jb_picture"><img itemprop="image" alt="99 francs (2007) by Jan Kounen" src="/images/2014/12/99-francs.png" longdesc="#822a28fd" /><figcaption id="822a28fd">99 francs (2007) by Jan Kounen</figcaption></figure><h2 id="he-is-breaking-our-process">He Is Breaking Our Process</h2><p>This is the most popular problem we face with our new clients. Once they gain access to the development environment, they try to give instructions directly to programmers, walking around <a href="/2014/10/06/software-project-lifecycle.html">our existing process</a>. “I’m paying these guys; why can’t I tell them what to do?” is a very typical mindset. Instead of submitting requests through our standard change management mechanism, such a client goes directly to one of the programmers and tells him what should be fixed, how, and when. It’s <a href="/2015/09/22/micromanagement.html">micro-management</a> in its worst form. We see it very often. What do we do?</p><aside class="quote">The simplest answer is that the client is a moron. Sometimes this is exactly the case, but it's a rare one.</aside><p>First, we try to understand why it’s happening. The simplest answer is that the client is a moron. Sometimes this is exactly the case, but it’s a rare one. Much more often, our clients are not that bad. What is it, then? Why can’t they follow the process and abide by the rules? There are a few possible reasons.</p><p>Maybe the <strong>rules are not explained well</strong>. This is the most popular root cause—the rules of work are not clear enough for the client. He just doesn’t know what he is supposed to do in order to submit a request and get it implemented. To prevent this, we try to educate our clients at the beginning of a new project. We even write guidance manuals for clients. Most of them are happy to read them and learn the way we work, because they understand that this is the best way to achieve success while working with us.</p><aside class="youtube"> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rip_04Bv3Jk"><div class="box"> <img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Rip_04Bv3Jk/mqdefault.jpg" alt="YouTube video #Rip_04Bv3Jk" /><div class="play"><i class="icon icon-play"></i></div></div></a><div>How to be Honest and Keep a Client?; 11 June 2017.</div></aside><p>Maybe our <strong>management is chaotic</strong>, and the client is trying to “organize” us by giving explicit instructions regarding the most important tasks. We’ve seen it before, and we are always trying to learn from this. As soon as we see that the client is trying to <a href="/2015/09/22/micromanagement.html">micro-manage</a> us, we ask ourselves: “Is our process transparent enough? Do we give enough information to the client about milestones, risks, plans, <a href="/2015/06/02/how-to-estimate-software-cost.html">costs</a>, etc.?” In most cases, it’s our own fault, and we’re trying to learn and improve. If so, it’s important to react fast, before the client becomes too aggressive in his orders and instructions. It will be very difficult to escort him back to the normal process once he gets “micro-management” in his blood.</p><p>Maybe the client is not busy enough and has <strong>a lot of free time</strong>, which he is happy to spend by giving orders and distracting your team. I’ve seen this many times. A solution? Keep him busy. Turn him into a member of the team and assign him some tasks related to documentation and research. In my experience, most clients would be happy to do this work and help the project.</p><h2 id="he-is-asking-too-much">He Is Asking Too Much</h2><p>A technically-savvy client can turn the life of <a href="/2014/10/12/who-is-software-architect.html">an architect</a> into a nightmare by constantly asking him to explain every single technical decision made, from “Why PostgreSQL instead of MySQL?” to “Why doesn’t this method throw a checked exception?” Constantly answering such questions can turn a project into a school of programming. Even though he is paying for our time, that doesn’t mean we should teach him how to develop software, right? On the other hand, he is interested in knowing how <em>his</em> software is developed and how it works. It’s a fair request, isn’t it?</p><aside class="quote">He is interested in knowing how his software is developed and how it works. It's a fair request, isn't it?</aside><p>I believe there is a <em>win-win</em> solution to this problem. Here is how we manage it. First of all, we make all his requests formal. We ask a client to create a new ticket for each request, properly explaining what is not clear and how much detail is expected in the explanation.</p><p>Second, we look at such requests positively—they are good indicators of certain inconsistencies in the software. If it’s not clear for the client why PostgreSQL is used and not MySQL, it’s a fault of <a href="/2014/10/12/who-is-software-architect.html">our architect</a>. He didn’t document his decision and didn’t explain how it was made, what other options were considered, what selection criteria were applied, etc. Thus, a request from a client is <a href="/2014/04/13/bugs-are-welcome.html">a bug</a> we get for free. So, we look at it positively.</p><p>Finally, we charge our clients for the answers given. Every question, submitted as a ticket, goes through the full flow and <a href="/2014/10/21/incremental-billing.html">gets billed</a> just as any other ticket. This approach prevents the client from asking for too much. He realizes that we’re ready to explain anything he wants, but he will pay for it.</p><h2 id="he-is-telling-too-much">He Is Telling Too Much</h2><p>This problem is even bigger than the previous one. Some clients believe they are savvy enough to argue with <a href="/2014/10/12/who-is-software-architect.html">our architect</a> and our programmers about how the software should be developed. They don’t just ask why PostgreSQL is used, they tell us that we should use MySQL, because “I know that it’s a great database; my friend is using it, and his business is growing!” Sometimes it gets even worse, when suggestions are directed at every class or even a method, like “You should use a Singleton pattern here!”</p><p>Our first choice is to agree and do what he wants. But it’s a road to nowhere. Once you do it, your project is ruined, and you should start thinking about a divorce with this client. Your entire team will quickly turn into a group of coding monkeys, <a href="/2015/09/22/micromanagement.html">micro-managed</a> by someone with some cash. It’s a very wrong direction; don’t even think about going there.</p><p>The second choice is to tell the client to mind his own business and let us do ours. He <a href="/2016/06/21/how-to-hire-programmer.html">hired</a> us because we’re professional enough to develop the software according to his requirements. If he questions our capabilities, he is free to <strong>change</strong> the contractor. But until then, he has to <a href="/2017/11/21/trust-pay-lose.html">trust</a> our decisions. Will this work? I doubt it. It’s the same as giving him the finger. He will get offended, and you won’t get anything.</p><p>The solution here is to turn the client’s demands into project requirements. Most of them will be lost in the process, because they won’t be sane enough to form a good requirement. Others will be documented, estimated, and crossed-out by the client himself, because he will realize they are pointless or too expensive. Only a few of them will survive, since they will be reasonable enough. And they will help the project. So it is also a <em>win-win</em> solution.</p><aside class="quote">Never take a client's demands directly to execution, but rather use them first to amend the requirements documentation.</aside><p>For example, he says that “you should use MySQL because it’s great.” You tell him that the project requirements document doesn’t limit you to choose whichever database you like. Should it? He says yes, of course! OK, let’s try to document such a requirement. How will it sound? How about, “We should only use great databases?” Sound correct? If so, then PostgreSQL satisfies this requirement. Problem solved; let us continue to do our work. He will have a hard time figuring out how to write a requirement in a way that disallows PostgreSQL but allows MySQL. It is simply not possible in most cases.</p><p>Sometimes, though, it will make sense; for example, “We should use a database server that understands our legacy data in MySQL format.” This is a perfectly sane requirement, and the only way to satisfy it is to use MySQL.</p><p>Thus, my recommendation is to never take a client’s demands directly to execution, but rather use them first to amend the requirements documentation. Even if you don’t have such documentation, create a simple one-page document. Agree with the client that you work against this document, and when anyone wants to change something, you first have to amend the document and then have your team ensure the software satisfies it. This kind of discipline will be accepted by any client and will protect you against sudden and distracting corrections.</p><h2 id="he-is-questioning-our-skills">He Is Questioning Our Skills</h2><p>When source code is open to the client, and he is technically capable of reading it, it is very possible that one day he will tell us that our code is crap and we have to learn how to program better. It has not happened in our projects for many years, but it has happened before, when we weren’t using static analysis as a <a href="/2014/08/13/strict-code-quality-control.html">mandatory step</a> in our <a href="/2014/10/08/continuous-integration-is-dead.html">continuous integration</a> pipeline.</p><p>Another funny possibility is when the client shows the source code to a “friend,” and he gives a “professional” opinion, which sounds like, “They don’t know what they are doing.” Once such an opinion hits your client’s ears, the project is at a significant risk of closure. It’ll be very difficult, almost impossible, to convince the client not to listen to the “friend” and continue to work with you. That’s why most <a href="/2015/10/27/outsourcing-doesnt-work.html">outsourcers</a> prefer to keep their sources private until the very end of the project, when the final invoice is paid.</p><aside class="quote">No matter how beautiful your architecture and your source code is, the "friend" will always be right.</aside><p>I think that an accidental appearance of a “friend” with a negative opinion is un-preventable.

I can’t count how many times I’ve heard these stories told by startup founders. Most of them are in love with their teams … until that day when it’s time to &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/06/21/how-to-hire-programmer.html&quot;&gt;hire&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;a new one&lt;/em&gt;. There could be many possible reasons for such a fiasco, but one of them is a lack of regular, systematic, and independent &lt;em&gt;technical reviews&lt;/em&gt;. Nothing demotivates a development team more than a lack of attention to their deliverables. On the other hand, a regular reconciliation of their results and your quality expectations is one of the key factors that will guarantee technical success for your startup. Below I summarize my experience with organizing such technical reviews.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;An independent review is when you ask someone outside of your team to look at your source code and other technical resources and give you an objective opinion about them. Every modern software team should also use internal code reviews, which is is something else entirely. An internal review occurs when one programmer shows his code to other peers on the team and asks their opinion. This usually happens as a daily activity and has nothing to do with independent reviews.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;An independent review is performed by a programmer who knows nothing about your team. He comes on board, checks out the code from your repository, spends a few hours (or days) looking at it and trying to understand what it does. Then, he tells you what is wrong and where. He explains how he would do it better, where he would change it, and what he would do instead. Then, you pay him and he leaves. You may never see him again, but his conclusions and suggestions help you &lt;em&gt;check the reality&lt;/em&gt; of your code and evaluate how your team is really doing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;badge&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zerocracy.com&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;//www.0crat.com/svg/logo.svg&quot; style=&quot;width:100px;max-width:100%;&quot; alt=&quot;badge&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;We, at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zerocracy.com&quot;&gt;Zerocracy&lt;/a&gt;, do independent reviews with every project of ours, and this is a list of principles we use:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make Independent Reviews Systematic&lt;/strong&gt;. This is the first and most important rule—organize such technical reviews regularly. Moreover, inform your team about the schedule, and let them be prepared for the reviews. Once a month is a good practice, according to my experience. Depending on your source code size, a full review should take from &lt;em&gt;two to eight hours&lt;/em&gt;. Don’t spend more than eight hours; there is no point in going too deep into the code during independent reviews.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pay for Bugs Found&lt;/strong&gt;. We &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/04/13/bugs-are-welcome.html&quot;&gt;always&lt;/a&gt; pay for bugs, not for the time spent finding them. We ask our reviewers to look at the code and report as many bugs as we think we need. For each bug, we pay 15 minutes for their time. In other words, we assume that a good reviewer can find and report approximately four problems in one hour. For example, a reviewer charges $150 per hour. We hire him and ask him to find and report the 20 most critical issues he can discover. Our estimate is that he should spend five hours on this work. Thus, he will get $750 when we have 20 bugs in our tracking system reported by him. If he finds fewer, he gets proportionally less money. This payment schedule will help you focus your reviewer on the main objective of the review process—finding and reporting issues. There are no other goals. The only thing you’re interested in is knowing what the issues with your current technical solution are. That’s what you’re paying for.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hire the Best and Pay Well&lt;/strong&gt;. My experience tells me that the position of an independent reviewer is a very important one. He is not just a programmer but more of &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/10/12/who-is-software-architect.html&quot;&gt;an architect&lt;/a&gt; who is capable of looking at the solution from a very high level of abstraction, while at the same time paying a lot of attention to details; he should be very good at designing similar systems; he should know how to report a bug correctly and with enough detail; he should understand your business domain; etc. Besides all that, he should be well motivated to help you. You’re not hiring him for full-time work but rather just for a few-hour gig. My advice is to try to get &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/10/29/how-much-do-you-cost.html&quot;&gt;the best guys&lt;/a&gt;, and pay them as much as they ask, usually over $100 per hour. Don’t negotiate, just pay. It’s just a few hundred dollars for you, but the effect of their contribution will be huge.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ask For and Expect Criticism&lt;/strong&gt;. It is a very common mistake to ask a reviewer, “Do you like our code?” Don’t expect him to tell you how great your code is. This is not what you’re paying him for! You already have a full team of programmers for cheering you up; they can tell you a lot about the code they are creating and how awesome it is. You don’t want to hear this again from the reviewer. Instead, you want to know what is wrong and needs to be fixed. So your questions should sound like, “What problems do you think we should fix first?” Some reviewers will try to please you with positive comments, but ignore that flattery and bring them back to the main goal—bugs. The payment schedule explained above should help.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Regularly Change Reviewers&lt;/strong&gt;. Try not to use the same reviewer more than once on the same project (I mean the same code base). I believe the reason here is obvious, but let me re-iterate: You don’t need your reviewer to be nice to you and tell you how great your code is. You want him to be objective and focused on problems, not on bright sides. If you hire the same person again and again, psychologically you make him engaged to the source code. He’s seen it once; now he has to see it again. He already told you about some problem, and now he has to repeat it again. He won’t feel comfortable doing it. Instead, he will start feeling like a member of the team and will feel &lt;em&gt;responsible&lt;/em&gt; for the source code and its mistakes. He, as any other team member, will start hiding issues instead of revealing them. Thus, for every independent technical review, get a new person.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be Polite and Honest With Your Team&lt;/strong&gt;. Independent reviews can be rather offensive to your programmers. They may think that you don’t trust them. They may feel that you don’t respect them as technical specialists. They may even decide that you’re getting ready to fire them all and are currently looking for new people. This is a very possible and very destructive side effect of an independent review. How do you avoid it? I can’t give you universal advice, but the best suggestion I can give is this: be honest with them. Tell them that the &lt;a href=&quot;/2017/12/26/software-quality-formula.html&quot;&gt;quality of the product&lt;/a&gt; is critical for you and your business. Explain to them that the business is paying them for their work and that in order to keep paychecks coming, you have to stress quality control—regularly, objectively, independently, and honestly. In the end, if you manage to organize reviews as this article explains, the team will be very thankful to you. They will gain a lot of new ideas and thoughts from every review and will ask you to repeat them regularly.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Review From Day One&lt;/strong&gt;. Don’t wait until the end of the project! I’ve seen this mistake many times. Very often startup founders think that until the product is done and ready for the market, they shouldn’t distract their team. They think they should let the team work toward project milestones and take care of quality later, “when we have a million visitors per day.” This day will never come if you let your team run without control! Start conducting independent reviews from the moment your Git repository has its first file. Until the repository is big enough, you may only spend $300 once a month to receive an objective, independent opinion about its quality. Will this ruin your budget?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prohibit Discussions, and Ask for Formal Reporting&lt;/strong&gt;. Don’t let your reviewers talk to the team. If you do, the entire idea of a review being independent falls apart. If a reviewer is able to ask informal questions and discuss your system design with your programmers, their answers will satisfy him, and he will move on. But you, the owner of the business, will stay exactly where you were before the review. The point of the review is not to make the reviewer happy. It is exactly the opposite. You want to make him confused! If he is confused, your design is wrong and he feels the need to report a bug. The source code should speak for itself, and it should be easy enough for a stranger (the reviewer) to understand how it works. If this is not the case, there is something wrong that should be fixed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Treat Any Question as a Bug&lt;/strong&gt;. Don’t expect a review to produce any bugs in functionality, like “I click this button and the system crashes.” This will happen rarely, if ever. Your team is very good at discovering these issues and fixing them. Independent reviews are not about that kind of bugs. The main goal of an independent review is to &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/11/24/principles-of-bug-tracking.html&quot;&gt;discover bugs&lt;/a&gt; in the architecture and design. Your product may work, but its architecture may have serious design flaws that won’t allow you, for example, to handle exponential growth in web traffic. An independent reviewer will help you find those &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/08/25/fail-fast.html&quot;&gt;flaws&lt;/a&gt; and address them sooner than later. In order to get bugs of that kind from the reviewer, you should encourage him to report &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt; he doesn’t like—unmotivated use of a technology, lack of documentation, unclear purpose of a file, absence of a unit test, etc. Remember, the reviewer is not a member of your team and has his own ideas about the technologies you’re using and software development in general. You’re interested in matching his vision with your team’s. Then, you’re interested in fixing all critical mismatches.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Review Everything, Not Just Source Code&lt;/strong&gt;. Let your reviewer look at all technical resources you have, not just source code files (&lt;code&gt;.java&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;.rb&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;.php&lt;/code&gt;, etc.) Give him access to the database schema, &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/10/08/continuous-integration-is-dead.html&quot;&gt;continuous integration&lt;/a&gt; panel, build environment, issue tracking system, plans and schedules, work agendas, up-time reports, deployment pipeline, production logs, customer &lt;a href=&quot;/2018/04/24/right-way-to-report-bugs.html&quot;&gt;bug reports&lt;/a&gt;, statistics, etc. Everything that could help him understand how your system works, and more importantly, where and how it breaks, is very useful. Don’t limit the reviewer to the source code only—this is simply not enough! Let him see the big picture, and you will get a much more detailed and professional report.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Track How Inconsistencies Are Resolved&lt;/strong&gt;. Once you get a report from the reviewer, make sure that the most important issues immediately get into your team’s backlog. Then, make sure they are addressed and closed. That doesn’t mean you should fix them all and listen to everything said by the reviewer. Definitely not! Your &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/10/12/who-is-software-architect.html&quot;&gt;architect&lt;/a&gt; runs the show, not the reviewer. Your &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/07/21/convince-me.html&quot;&gt;architect&lt;/a&gt; should decide what is right and what is wrong in the technical implementation of the product. But it’s important to make him resolve all concerns raised by the reviewer. Very often you will get answers like these from him: “We don’t care about it now,” “we won’t fix it until the next release,” or “he is wrong; we’re doing it better.” These answers are perfectly valid, but they have to be given (reviewers are people and they also make mistakes). The answers will help you, the founder, understand what your team is doing and how well they understand their business.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;hr /&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you can offer more suggestions, based on your experience, please post them below in the comments, and I’ll add them to the list.

I can’t count how many times I’ve heard these stories told by startup founders. Most of them are in love with their teams … until that day when it’s time to &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/06/21/how-to-hire-programmer.html&quot;&gt;hire&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;a new one&lt;/em&gt;. There could be many possible reasons for such a fiasco, but one of them is a lack of regular, systematic, and independent &lt;em&gt;technical reviews&lt;/em&gt;. Nothing demotivates a development team more than a lack of attention to their deliverables. On the other hand, a regular reconciliation of their results and your quality expectations is one of the key factors that will guarantee technical success for your startup. Below I summarize my experience with organizing such technical reviews.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;An independent review is when you ask someone outside of your team to look at your source code and other technical resources and give you an objective opinion about them. Every modern software team should also use internal code reviews, which is is something else entirely. An internal review occurs when one programmer shows his code to other peers on the team and asks their opinion. This usually happens as a daily activity and has nothing to do with independent reviews.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;An independent review is performed by a programmer who knows nothing about your team. He comes on board, checks out the code from your repository, spends a few hours (or days) looking at it and trying to understand what it does. Then, he tells you what is wrong and where. He explains how he would do it better, where he would change it, and what he would do instead. Then, you pay him and he leaves. You may never see him again, but his conclusions and suggestions help you &lt;em&gt;check the reality&lt;/em&gt; of your code and evaluate how your team is really doing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;badge&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zerocracy.com&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;//www.0crat.com/svg/logo.svg&quot; style=&quot;width:100px;max-width:100%;&quot; alt=&quot;badge&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;We, at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zerocracy.com&quot;&gt;Zerocracy&lt;/a&gt;, do independent reviews with every project of ours, and this is a list of principles we use:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make Independent Reviews Systematic&lt;/strong&gt;. This is the first and most important rule—organize such technical reviews regularly. Moreover, inform your team about the schedule, and let them be prepared for the reviews. Once a month is a good practice, according to my experience. Depending on your source code size, a full review should take from &lt;em&gt;two to eight hours&lt;/em&gt;. Don’t spend more than eight hours; there is no point in going too deep into the code during independent reviews.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pay for Bugs Found&lt;/strong&gt;. We &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/04/13/bugs-are-welcome.html&quot;&gt;always&lt;/a&gt; pay for bugs, not for the time spent finding them. We ask our reviewers to look at the code and report as many bugs as we think we need. For each bug, we pay 15 minutes for their time. In other words, we assume that a good reviewer can find and report approximately four problems in one hour. For example, a reviewer charges $150 per hour. We hire him and ask him to find and report the 20 most critical issues he can discover. Our estimate is that he should spend five hours on this work. Thus, he will get $750 when we have 20 bugs in our tracking system reported by him. If he finds fewer, he gets proportionally less money. This payment schedule will help you focus your reviewer on the main objective of the review process—finding and reporting issues. There are no other goals. The only thing you’re interested in is knowing what the issues with your current technical solution are. That’s what you’re paying for.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hire the Best and Pay Well&lt;/strong&gt;. My experience tells me that the position of an independent reviewer is a very important one. He is not just a programmer but more of &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/10/12/who-is-software-architect.html&quot;&gt;an architect&lt;/a&gt; who is capable of looking at the solution from a very high level of abstraction, while at the same time paying a lot of attention to details; he should be very good at designing similar systems; he should know how to report a bug correctly and with enough detail; he should understand your business domain; etc. Besides all that, he should be well motivated to help you. You’re not hiring him for full-time work but rather just for a few-hour gig. My advice is to try to get &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/10/29/how-much-do-you-cost.html&quot;&gt;the best guys&lt;/a&gt;, and pay them as much as they ask, usually over $100 per hour. Don’t negotiate, just pay. It’s just a few hundred dollars for you, but the effect of their contribution will be huge.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ask For and Expect Criticism&lt;/strong&gt;. It is a very common mistake to ask a reviewer, “Do you like our code?” Don’t expect him to tell you how great your code is. This is not what you’re paying him for! You already have a full team of programmers for cheering you up; they can tell you a lot about the code they are creating and how awesome it is. You don’t want to hear this again from the reviewer. Instead, you want to know what is wrong and needs to be fixed. So your questions should sound like, “What problems do you think we should fix first?” Some reviewers will try to please you with positive comments, but ignore that flattery and bring them back to the main goal—bugs. The payment schedule explained above should help.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Regularly Change Reviewers&lt;/strong&gt;. Try not to use the same reviewer more than once on the same project (I mean the same code base). I believe the reason here is obvious, but let me re-iterate: You don’t need your reviewer to be nice to you and tell you how great your code is. You want him to be objective and focused on problems, not on bright sides. If you hire the same person again and again, psychologically you make him engaged to the source code. He’s seen it once; now he has to see it again. He already told you about some problem, and now he has to repeat it again. He won’t feel comfortable doing it. Instead, he will start feeling like a member of the team and will feel &lt;em&gt;responsible&lt;/em&gt; for the source code and its mistakes. He, as any other team member, will start hiding issues instead of revealing them. Thus, for every independent technical review, get a new person.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be Polite and Honest With Your Team&lt;/strong&gt;. Independent reviews can be rather offensive to your programmers. They may think that you don’t trust them. They may feel that you don’t respect them as technical specialists. They may even decide that you’re getting ready to fire them all and are currently looking for new people. This is a very possible and very destructive side effect of an independent review. How do you avoid it? I can’t give you universal advice, but the best suggestion I can give is this: be honest with them. Tell them that the &lt;a href=&quot;/2017/12/26/software-quality-formula.html&quot;&gt;quality of the product&lt;/a&gt; is critical for you and your business. Explain to them that the business is paying them for their work and that in order to keep paychecks coming, you have to stress quality control—regularly, objectively, independently, and honestly. In the end, if you manage to organize reviews as this article explains, the team will be very thankful to you. They will gain a lot of new ideas and thoughts from every review and will ask you to repeat them regularly.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Review From Day One&lt;/strong&gt;. Don’t wait until the end of the project! I’ve seen this mistake many times. Very often startup founders think that until the product is done and ready for the market, they shouldn’t distract their team. They think they should let the team work toward project milestones and take care of quality later, “when we have a million visitors per day.” This day will never come if you let your team run without control! Start conducting independent reviews from the moment your Git repository has its first file.

and enthusiastic programmers? Of course! You’ve carefully chosen them from a hundred candidates! Are they passionate about the product? Absolutely! They use cutting-edge technologies, never sleep, and hardly eat or drink anything except coffee! Do they believe in your business success? No doubts about it; they live and breathe all those features, releases, continuous delivery, user experience, etc. Are you sure they are developing the product <em>correctly</em>? Well, yes, you’re pretty sure; why wouldn’t they? …</p><figure class="jb_picture"><img itemprop="image" alt="Arizona Dream (1992) by Emir Kusturica" src="/images/2014/12/arizona-dream-car-shop.png" longdesc="#4382e3b5" /><figcaption id="4382e3b5">Arizona Dream (1992) by Emir Kusturica</figcaption></figure><p>Does this sound <a href="/2017/11/21/trust-pay-lose.html">familiar</a>? I can’t count how many times I’ve heard these stories told by startup founders. Most of them are in love with their teams … until that day when it’s time to <a href="/2016/06/21/how-to-hire-programmer.html">hire</a> <em>a new one</em>. There could be many possible reasons for such a fiasco, but one of them is a lack of regular, systematic, and independent <em>technical reviews</em>. Nothing demotivates a development team more than a lack of attention to their deliverables. On the other hand, a regular reconciliation of their results and your quality expectations is one of the key factors that will guarantee technical success for your startup. Below I summarize my experience with organizing such technical reviews.</p><p>An independent review is when you ask someone outside of your team to look at your source code and other technical resources and give you an objective opinion about them. Every modern software team should also use internal code reviews, which is is something else entirely. An internal review occurs when one programmer shows his code to other peers on the team and asks their opinion. This usually happens as a daily activity and has nothing to do with independent reviews.</p><p>An independent review is performed by a programmer who knows nothing about your team. He comes on board, checks out the code from your repository, spends a few hours (or days) looking at it and trying to understand what it does. Then, he tells you what is wrong and where. He explains how he would do it better, where he would change it, and what he would do instead. Then, you pay him and he leaves. You may never see him again, but his conclusions and suggestions help you <em>check the reality</em> of your code and evaluate how your team is really doing.</p><figure class="badge"><a href="https://www.zerocracy.com"><img src="//www.0crat.com/svg/logo.svg" style="width:100px;max-width:100%;" alt="badge" /></a></figure><p>We, at <a href="https://www.zerocracy.com">Zerocracy</a>, do independent reviews with every project of ours, and this is a list of principles we use:</p><p><strong>Make Independent Reviews Systematic</strong>. This is the first and most important rule—organize such technical reviews regularly. Moreover, inform your team about the schedule, and let them be prepared for the reviews. Once a month is a good practice, according to my experience. Depending on your source code size, a full review should take from <em>two to eight hours</em>. Don’t spend more than eight hours; there is no point in going too deep into the code during independent reviews.</p><p><strong>Pay for Bugs Found</strong>. We <a href="/2014/04/13/bugs-are-welcome.html">always</a> pay for bugs, not for the time spent finding them. We ask our reviewers to look at the code and report as many bugs as we think we need. For each bug, we pay 15 minutes for their time. In other words, we assume that a good reviewer can find and report approximately four problems in one hour. For example, a reviewer charges $150 per hour. We hire him and ask him to find and report the 20 most critical issues he can discover. Our estimate is that he should spend five hours on this work. Thus, he will get $750 when we have 20 bugs in our tracking system reported by him. If he finds fewer, he gets proportionally less money. This payment schedule will help you focus your reviewer on the main objective of the review process—finding and reporting issues. There are no other goals. The only thing you’re interested in is knowing what the issues with your current technical solution are. That’s what you’re paying for.</p><p><strong>Hire the Best and Pay Well</strong>. My experience tells me that the position of an independent reviewer is a very important one. He is not just a programmer but more of <a href="/2014/10/12/who-is-software-architect.html">an architect</a> who is capable of looking at the solution from a very high level of abstraction, while at the same time paying a lot of attention to details; he should be very good at designing similar systems; he should know how to report a bug correctly and with enough detail; he should understand your business domain; etc. Besides all that, he should be well motivated to help you. You’re not hiring him for full-time work but rather just for a few-hour gig. My advice is to try to get <a href="/2014/10/29/how-much-do-you-cost.html">the best guys</a>, and pay them as much as they ask, usually over $100 per hour. Don’t negotiate, just pay. It’s just a few hundred dollars for you, but the effect of their contribution will be huge.</p><p><strong>Ask For and Expect Criticism</strong>. It is a very common mistake to ask a reviewer, “Do you like our code?” Don’t expect him to tell you how great your code is. This is not what you’re paying him for! You already have a full team of programmers for cheering you up; they can tell you a lot about the code they are creating and how awesome it is. You don’t want to hear this again from the reviewer. Instead, you want to know what is wrong and needs to be fixed. So your questions should sound like, “What problems do you think we should fix first?” Some reviewers will try to please you with positive comments, but ignore that flattery and bring them back to the main goal—bugs. The payment schedule explained above should help.</p><p><strong>Regularly Change Reviewers</strong>. Try not to use the same reviewer more than once on the same project (I mean the same code base). I believe the reason here is obvious, but let me re-iterate: You don’t need your reviewer to be nice to you and tell you how great your code is. You want him to be objective and focused on problems, not on bright sides. If you hire the same person again and again, psychologically you make him engaged to the source code. He’s seen it once; now he has to see it again. He already told you about some problem, and now he has to repeat it again. He won’t feel comfortable doing it. Instead, he will start feeling like a member of the team and will feel <em>responsible</em> for the source code and its mistakes. He, as any other team member, will start hiding issues instead of revealing them. Thus, for every independent technical review, get a new person.</p><p><strong>Be Polite and Honest With Your Team</strong>. Independent reviews can be rather offensive to your programmers. They may think that you don’t trust them. They may feel that you don’t respect them as technical specialists. They may even decide that you’re getting ready to fire them all and are currently looking for new people. This is a very possible and very destructive side effect of an independent review. How do you avoid it? I can’t give you universal advice, but the best suggestion I can give is this: be honest with them. Tell them that the <a href="/2017/12/26/software-quality-formula.html">quality of the product</a> is critical for you and your business. Explain to them that the business is paying them for their work and that in order to keep paychecks coming, you have to stress quality control—regularly, objectively, independently, and honestly. In the end, if you manage to organize reviews as this article explains, the team will be very thankful to you. They will gain a lot of new ideas and thoughts from every review and will ask you to repeat them regularly.</p><p><strong>Review From Day One</strong>. Don’t wait until the end of the project! I’ve seen this mistake many times. Very often startup founders think that until the product is done and ready for the market, they shouldn’t distract their team. They think they should let the team work toward project milestones and take care of quality later, “when we have a million visitors per day.” This day will never come if you let your team run without control! Start conducting independent reviews from the moment your Git repository has its first file. Until the repository is big enough, you may only spend $300 once a month to receive an objective, independent opinion about its quality. Will this ruin your budget?</p><p><strong>Prohibit Discussions, and Ask for Formal Reporting</strong>. Don’t let your reviewers talk to the team. If you do, the entire idea of a review being independent falls apart. If a reviewer is able to ask informal questions and discuss your system design with your programmers, their answers will satisfy him, and he will move on. But you, the owner of the business, will stay exactly where you were before the review. The point of the review is not to make the reviewer happy. It is exactly the opposite. You want to make him confused! If he is confused, your design is wrong and he feels the need to report a bug. The source code should speak for itself, and it should be easy enough for a stranger (the reviewer) to understand how it works. If this is not the case, there is something wrong that should be fixed.</p><p><strong>Treat Any Question as a Bug</strong>. Don’t expect a review to produce any bugs in functionality, like “I click this button and the system crashes.” This will happen rarely, if ever. Your team is very good at discovering these issues and fixing them. Independent reviews are not about that kind of bugs. The main goal of an independent review is to <a href="/2014/11/24/principles-of-bug-tracking.html">discover bugs</a> in the architecture and design. Your product may work, but its architecture may have serious design flaws that won’t allow you, for example, to handle exponential growth in web traffic. An independent reviewer will help you find those <a href="/2015/08/25/fail-fast.html">flaws</a> and address them sooner than later. In order to get bugs of that kind from the reviewer, you should encourage him to report <em>anything</em> he doesn’t like—unmotivated use of a technology, lack of documentation, unclear purpose of a file, absence of a unit test, etc. Remember, the reviewer is not a member of your team and has his own ideas about the technologies you’re using and software development in general. You’re interested in matching his vision with your team’s. Then, you’re interested in fixing all critical mismatches.</p><p><strong>Review Everything, Not Just Source Code</strong>. Let your reviewer look at all technical resources you have, not just source code files (<code>.java</code>, <code>.rb</code>, <code>.php</code>, etc.) Give him access to the database schema, <a href="/2014/10/08/continuous-integration-is-dead.html">continuous integration</a> panel, build environment, issue tracking system, plans and schedules, work agendas, up-time reports, deployment pipeline, production logs, customer <a href="/2018/04/24/right-way-to-report-bugs.html">bug reports</a>, statistics, etc. Everything that could help him understand how your system works, and more importantly, where and how it breaks, is very useful. Don’t limit the reviewer to the source code only—this is simply not enough! Let him see the big picture, and you will get a much more detailed and professional report.</p><p><strong>Track How Inconsistencies Are Resolved</strong>. Once you get a report from the reviewer, make sure that the most important issues immediately get into your team’s backlog. Then, make sure they are addressed and closed. That doesn’t mean you should fix them all and listen to everything said by the reviewer. Definitely not! Your <a href="/2014/10/12/who-is-software-architect.html">architect</a> runs the show, not the reviewer. Your <a href="/2016/07/21/convince-me.html">architect</a> should decide what is right and what is wrong in the technical implementation of the product. But it’s important to make him resolve all concerns raised by the reviewer. Very often you will get answers like these from him: “We don’t care about it now,” “we won’t fix it until the next release,” or “he is wrong; we’re doing it better.” These answers are perfectly valid, but they have to be given (reviewers are people and they also make mistakes). The answers will help you, the founder, understand what your team is doing and how well they understand their business.</p><hr /><p>If you can offer more suggestions, based on your experience, please post them below in the comments, and I’ll add them to the list.

Long-living tickets are a &lt;a href=&quot;/2017/06/06/gluten-free-management.html&quot;&gt;management&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;nightmare&lt;/strong&gt;. It is difficult to track them and control them. It’s difficult to understand what’s going on. Have you seen those two-year-old tickets in &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/12/22/why-dont-you-contribute-to-open-source.html&quot;&gt;open source projects&lt;/a&gt; that have hundreds of comments and no deliverables? It is a mistake by their &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/09/22/micromanagement.html&quot;&gt;project managers&lt;/a&gt; and ticket participants.

This is an ideal scenario.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Long-living tickets are a management nightmare&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;As soon as you realize that your ticket is turning into a long discussion, try to close it even faster. How can I close it if the reporter doesn’t like my solution? Find a temporary solution that will satisfy the reporter and allow you to close the ticket. Use “TODO” in your code or dirty workarounds—they are all better than a ticket hovering for a long time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Once you see that the solution is provided and is sufficient enough to close the ticket, ask its reporter to close it. Explicitly ask for that; don’t dance around with “looks like this solution may be accepted, if you don’t mind.” Be explicit in your intention to close the ticket and move on. Try this: “@jeff, please close the ticket if you don’t have any further questions.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;3-dont-close-it&quot;&gt;3. Don’t Close It!&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Every time you raise a bug and create a new ticket, you consume project resources. Every bug report means money spent on the project: 1) money for your time spent finding the problem and reporting it; 2) for the time of the &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/05/24/who-is-project-manager.html&quot;&gt;project manager&lt;/a&gt; who is working with the ticket and finding who will fix it; 3) for the time of the ticket solver, who is trying to understand your report and provide a solution; and also 4) for the time of everybody else who will participate in the discussion.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Anything would work, but not nothing&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you close the ticket without a problem being properly solved, you put this money into the &lt;strong&gt;trash&lt;/strong&gt; bin. Once the ticket is started, there is no way back. We can’t just say, “Nah, ignore it; it’s not important anymore.” Your ticket already consumed project time and budget resources, and in order to turn them into something useful, you have to make sure that &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; solution is delivered.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It can be a temporary solution. It can be a single line change in the project documentation. It can be a TODO marker in the code saying that “we are aware of the problem but won’t fix it because we’re lazy.” Anything would work, but not nothing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Look at it from a different perspective. When you started that ticket, you had something in mind. Something was not right with the product. That’s why you reported a bug. If you close the ticket without anyone even touching that place of code, someone else will have the same concern in a few days or a few years. And then the project will have to &lt;strong&gt;pay again&lt;/strong&gt; for a similar ticket or discussion of the same problem. Even if you’re convinced that the issue you found in the code is not really an issue, ask a ticket resolver to document it right in the source code in order to prevent such confusion from happening again in the future.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;4-avoid-noiseaddress-your-comments&quot;&gt;4. Avoid Noise—Address Your Comments&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Every time you post a message to the ticket, address it to someone. Otherwise, if you post just because you want to express your opinion, your comments become communication &lt;strong&gt;noise&lt;/strong&gt;. Remember, a ticket is a conversation between two people—one of them reported an issue and the other one is trying to fix it. Comments like, “How about we try another approach” or “I remember I had a similar issue some time ago” are very annoying and distracting. Let’s be honest, nobody really needs or cares about “opinions.” All we need in a ticket is a solution(s).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Don't pollute the air with generic opinions&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you think the ticket should be closed because the introduced solution is good enough, address your comment to the ticket reporter. And start it with “@jeff, I think the solution you’ve got already is good enough, because…” This way, you will help the assigned to close the ticket and move on.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you think the solution is wrong, address your comment to the assigned of the ticket, starting with “@jeff, I believe your solution is not good enough because…” This way, you will help the ticket reporter keep the ticket open until a proper solution comes up.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Again, don’t pollute the air with generic opinions. Instead, be very specific and take sides—you either like the solution and want the ticket to be closed, or you don’t like it and want the ticket to stay open. Everything in between is just making the situation more complex and isn’t helping the project at all.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;5-report-when-it-is-broken&quot;&gt;5. Report When It Is Broken&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;I think it is obvious, but I will reiterate: Every bug has to be reproducible. Every time you &lt;a href=&quot;/2018/04/24/right-way-to-report-bugs.html&quot;&gt;report a bug&lt;/a&gt;, you should explain how exactly the product is broken. Yes, it is your job to prove that the software doesn’t work as intended, or is not documented properly, or doesn’t satisfy the &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/11/10/ten-mistakes-in-specs.html&quot;&gt;requirements&lt;/a&gt;, etc.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Every bug report should follow the same simple formula: “This is what we &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt;, this is what we &lt;em&gt;should have&lt;/em&gt; instead, so fix it.” Every ticket, be it a bug, a task, a question, or a suggestion, should be formatted in this way. By submitting it, you’re asking the project to move from point A to point B. Something is not right at point A, and it will be much better for all of us to be at that point B. So it’s obvious that you have to explain where these points A and B are. It is highly desirable if you can explain how to get there—how to reproduce a problem and how to fix it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Your job, as a ticket reporter, is to draw that line from point A to point B&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;Even when you have a question, you should also follow that format. If you have a question, it means the project documentation is not sufficient enough for you to find an answer there. This is what is broken. You should ask for a fix. So instead of reporting, “How should I use class X?,” say something like, “The current documentation is not complete; it doesn’t explain how I should use class X. Please fix.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you can’t explain how to get there, say so in the ticket: “I see that this class doesn’t work as it should, but I don’t know how to reproduce the problem and how to fix it.” This will give everybody a clear message that you are aware that your &lt;a href=&quot;/2018/04/24/right-way-to-report-bugs.html&quot;&gt;bug report&lt;/a&gt; is not perfect. The first step for its resolver will be to refine the problem and find a way to reproduce it. If such a replica can’t be found, obviously your bug will be forced into closing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Let me reiterate again: Every ticket is dragging the project from point A, where something is not right, to point B, where it is fixed. Your job, as a ticket reporter, is to draw that line—clearly and explicitly.&lt;/p&gt; " /> <meta name="keywords" content="next, path, output, content, previous, url, relative_path, id, collection, excerpt, draft, categories, layout, title, date, tags, description, keywords, image, jb_picture, slug, ext" /> <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1"/> <meta name="google-site-verification" content="JEj_gQr2CPe2QKGw8XdMz0R7VboQIUbX3FlM-lwTq-8" /> <meta name="author" content="Yegor Bugayenko"> <meta name="article:published_time" content="2014-11-24 00:00:00 +0000"> <meta name="og:site_name" content="Yegor Bugayenko"/> <meta name="og:type" content="article" /> <meta name="og:locale" content="en_US" /> <meta name="twitter:account_id" content="4503599630178231" /> <meta name="twitter:creator" content="@yegor256"/> <meta name="twitter:site" content="@yegor256"/> <meta name="twitter:title" property="og:title" content="Five Principles of Bug Tracking"/> <meta name="twitter:description" property="og:description" content="&lt;p&gt;A team working &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/09/22/remote-programming-interview.html&quot;&gt;remotely&lt;/a&gt; requires much stronger discipline than a co-located crew sitting in the same &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/10/06/how-to-be-good-office-slave.html&quot;&gt;office&lt;/a&gt;.

We can’t just say, “Nah, ignore it; it’s not important anymore.” Your ticket already consumed project time and budget resources, and in order to turn them into something useful, you have to make sure that &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; solution is delivered.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It can be a temporary solution. It can be a single line change in the project documentation. It can be a TODO marker in the code saying that “we are aware of the problem but won’t fix it because we’re lazy.” Anything would work, but not nothing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Look at it from a different perspective. When you started that ticket, you had something in mind. Something was not right with the product. That’s why you reported a bug. If you close the ticket without anyone even touching that place of code, someone else will have the same concern in a few days or a few years. And then the project will have to &lt;strong&gt;pay again&lt;/strong&gt; for a similar ticket or discussion of the same problem. Even if you’re convinced that the issue you found in the code is not really an issue, ask a ticket resolver to document it right in the source code in order to prevent such confusion from happening again in the future.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;4-avoid-noiseaddress-your-comments&quot;&gt;4. Avoid Noise—Address Your Comments&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Every time you post a message to the ticket, address it to someone. Otherwise, if you post just because you want to express your opinion, your comments become communication &lt;strong&gt;noise&lt;/strong&gt;. Remember, a ticket is a conversation between two people—one of them reported an issue and the other one is trying to fix it. Comments like, “How about we try another approach” or “I remember I had a similar issue some time ago” are very annoying and distracting. Let’s be honest, nobody really needs or cares about “opinions.” All we need in a ticket is a solution(s).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Don't pollute the air with generic opinions&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you think the ticket should be closed because the introduced solution is good enough, address your comment to the ticket reporter. And start it with “@jeff, I think the solution you’ve got already is good enough, because…” This way, you will help the assigned to close the ticket and move on.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you think the solution is wrong, address your comment to the assigned of the ticket, starting with “@jeff, I believe your solution is not good enough because…” This way, you will help the ticket reporter keep the ticket open until a proper solution comes up.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Again, don’t pollute the air with generic opinions. Instead, be very specific and take sides—you either like the solution and want the ticket to be closed, or you don’t like it and want the ticket to stay open. Everything in between is just making the situation more complex and isn’t helping the project at all.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;5-report-when-it-is-broken&quot;&gt;5. Report When It Is Broken&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;I think it is obvious, but I will reiterate: Every bug has to be reproducible. Every time you &lt;a href=&quot;/2018/04/24/right-way-to-report-bugs.html&quot;&gt;report a bug&lt;/a&gt;, you should explain how exactly the product is broken. Yes, it is your job to prove that the software doesn’t work as intended, or is not documented properly, or doesn’t satisfy the &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/11/10/ten-mistakes-in-specs.html&quot;&gt;requirements&lt;/a&gt;, etc.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Every bug report should follow the same simple formula: “This is what we &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt;, this is what we &lt;em&gt;should have&lt;/em&gt; instead, so fix it.” Every ticket, be it a bug, a task, a question, or a suggestion, should be formatted in this way. By submitting it, you’re asking the project to move from point A to point B. Something is not right at point A, and it will be much better for all of us to be at that point B. So it’s obvious that you have to explain where these points A and B are. It is highly desirable if you can explain how to get there—how to reproduce a problem and how to fix it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Your job, as a ticket reporter, is to draw that line from point A to point B&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;Even when you have a question, you should also follow that format. If you have a question, it means the project documentation is not sufficient enough for you to find an answer there. This is what is broken. You should ask for a fix. So instead of reporting, “How should I use class X?,” say something like, “The current documentation is not complete; it doesn’t explain how I should use class X. Please fix.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you can’t explain how to get there, say so in the ticket: “I see that this class doesn’t work as it should, but I don’t know how to reproduce the problem and how to fix it.” This will give everybody a clear message that you are aware that your &lt;a href=&quot;/2018/04/24/right-way-to-report-bugs.html&quot;&gt;bug report&lt;/a&gt; is not perfect. The first step for its resolver will be to refine the problem and find a way to reproduce it. If such a replica can’t be found, obviously your bug will be forced into closing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Let me reiterate again: Every ticket is dragging the project from point A, where something is not right, to point B, where it is fixed. Your job, as a ticket reporter, is to draw that line—clearly and explicitly.&lt;/p&gt; "/> <meta name="twitter:url" property="og:url"

href="/2014/09/22/remote-programming-interview.html">remotely</a> requires much stronger discipline than a co-located crew sitting in the same <a href="/2015/10/06/how-to-be-good-office-slave.html">office</a>. First of all, I mean discipline of communications. At <a href="https://www.zerocracy.com">Zerocracy</a>, we have developed software remotely for the last five years. We manage tasks strictly through ticketing systems (like GitHub, JIRA, Trac, Basecamp, etc.) and <a href="/2014/10/07/stop-chatting-start-coding.html">discourage</a> any informal communications, like Skype, HipChat, <a href="/2017/04/18/no-help-via-email.html">emails</a>, or phone calls. Every ticket for us is an isolated task with its own life cycle, its own participants, and its own goal. Over these years, we’ve learned a few lessons that I want to share. If you also work <a href="/2017/05/02/remote-slaves.html">remotely</a> with your team, you may find them useful.</p><figure class="jb_picture"><img itemprop="image" alt="Monty Python Flying Circus, TV Series (1969-1974)" src="/images/2014/11/monty-python-argument-sketch.png" longdesc="#d0e338b8" /><figcaption id="d0e338b8">Monty Python Flying Circus, TV Series (1969-1974)</figcaption></figure><h2 id="1-keep-it-one-on-one">1. Keep It One-on-One</h2><p>Each ticket (aka “bug”) is a link between two people: problem specifier and problem solver. If it is a bug, I’m reporting it—you’re solving it. If it is a question, I’m asking for an explanation—you’re explaining. If it is a task, I’m ordering you to do it—you’re doing it. In any case, there are two main characters. No matter how many people are involved in the ticket resolution, only these two characters have formal roles.</p><aside class="quote">Remember what is happening there - one person is selling his solution to another person</aside><p>The responsibility of the ticket reporter is to <strong>defend the problem</strong>. When I <a href="/2018/04/24/right-way-to-report-bugs.html">report a bug</a>, I have to insist that it exists—this is my job. Others may tell me that I’m wrong and the bug is not there. They may tell me that they can’t reproduce it. They may say that my description of a task is too <strong>vague</strong> and nobody understands it. There may be many issues of that kind. My job is to do the best I can in order to <em>keep the ticket alive</em>. Obviously, if the bug is not reproducible, I’ll be forced to close the ticket. However, until the ticket is closed, I’m its guardian angel. :)</p><aside class="youtube"> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DYr8GYzJ6Q"><div class="box"> <img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7DYr8GYzJ6Q/mqdefault.jpg" alt="YouTube video #7DYr8GYzJ6Q" /><div class="play"><i class="icon icon-play"></i></div></div></a><div>The Philosophy of Bugs (webinar #17); 3 August 2016.</div></aside><p>On the other hand, the responsibility of the ticket solver is to <strong>defend the solution</strong>. When a ticket is assigned to me and I have to resolve it, my job is to convince the reporter that my solution is good enough. He may tell me that my solution is not sufficient, not the most efficient, or incomplete. My job is to insist that I’m right and he is wrong. Well, of course, in a reasonable way. And in order to create a solution that will be accepted as sufficient enough, I have to understand the problem first, investigate all possible options, and propose the most elegant implementation. But all this is secondary. The first thing I will be focused on is how to convince the reporter. I will always remember that my primary goal is to <em>close the ticket</em>.</p><p>My point here is that no matter how many people are involved in the ticket discussion, always remember what is happening there—one person is selling his solution to another person. Everybody else around them is help or distraction (see below).</p><h2 id="2-close-it">2. Close It!</h2><p>Remember that a ticket is <a href="/2014/10/07/stop-chatting-start-coding.html">not a chat</a>. You’re not there to talk. You’re there to <em>close</em>. When the ticket is assigned to you, focus on closing it as soon as possible (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVQPY4LlbJ4">Always Be Closing</a>, remember?).</p><p>Also, keep in mind that the sooner you close the ticket, the better job you will do for the project. Long-living tickets are a <a href="/2017/06/06/gluten-free-management.html">management</a> <strong>nightmare</strong>. It is difficult to track them and control them. It’s difficult to understand what’s going on. Have you seen those two-year-old tickets in <a href="/2015/12/22/why-dont-you-contribute-to-open-source.html">open source projects</a> that have hundreds of comments and no deliverables? It is a mistake by their <a href="/2015/09/22/micromanagement.html">project managers</a> and ticket participants. Each ticket should be short and focused—1) a problem, 2) a refinement question, 3) a short explanation, 4) a solution, 5) closed, thanks everybody. This is an ideal scenario.</p><aside class="quote">Long-living tickets are a management nightmare</aside><p>As soon as you realize that your ticket is turning into a long discussion, try to close it even faster. How can I close it if the reporter doesn’t like my solution? Find a temporary solution that will satisfy the reporter and allow you to close the ticket. Use “TODO” in your code or dirty workarounds—they are all better than a ticket hovering for a long time.</p><p>Once you see that the solution is provided and is sufficient enough to close the ticket, ask its reporter to close it. Explicitly ask for that; don’t dance around with “looks like this solution may be accepted, if you don’t mind.” Be explicit in your intention to close the ticket and move on. Try this: “@jeff, please close the ticket if you don’t have any further questions.”</p><h2 id="3-dont-close-it">3. Don’t Close It!</h2><p>Every time you raise a bug and create a new ticket, you consume project resources. Every bug report means money spent on the project: 1) money for your time spent finding the problem and reporting it; 2) for the time of the <a href="/2016/05/24/who-is-project-manager.html">project manager</a> who is working with the ticket and finding who will fix it; 3) for the time of the ticket solver, who is trying to understand your report and provide a solution; and also 4) for the time of everybody else who will participate in the discussion.</p><aside class="quote">Anything would work, but not nothing</aside><p>If you close the ticket without a problem being properly solved, you put this money into the <strong>trash</strong> bin.

First of all, I mean discipline of communications. At <a href="https://www.zerocracy.com">Zerocracy</a>, we have developed software remotely for the last five years.

If it is a question, I’m asking for an explanation—you’re explaining. If it is a task, I’m ordering you to do it—you’re doing it. In any case, there are two main characters.

They may tell me that they can’t reproduce it. They may say that my description of a task is too <strong>vague</strong> and nobody understands it. There may be many issues of that kind.

When a ticket is assigned to me and I have to resolve it, my job is to convince the reporter that my solution is good enough. He may tell me that my solution is not sufficient, not the most efficient, or incomplete. My job is to insist that I’m right and he is wrong. Well, of course, in a reasonable way. And in order to create a solution that will be accepted as sufficient enough, I have to understand the problem first, investigate all possible options, and propose the most elegant implementation. But all this is secondary. The first thing I will be focused on is how to convince the reporter. I will always remember that my primary goal is to <em>close the ticket</em>.</p><p>My point here is that no matter how many people are involved in the ticket discussion, always remember what is happening there—one person is selling his solution to another person. Everybody else around them is help or distraction (see below).</p><h2 id="2-close-it">2. Close It!</h2><p>Remember that a ticket is <a href="/2014/10/07/stop-chatting-start-coding.html">not a chat</a>. You’re not there to talk. You’re there to <em>close</em>. When the ticket is assigned to you, focus on closing it as soon as possible (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVQPY4LlbJ4">Always Be Closing</a>, remember?).</p><p>Also, keep in mind that the sooner you close the ticket, the better job you will do for the project. Long-living tickets are a <a href="/2017/06/06/gluten-free-management.html">management</a> <strong>nightmare</strong>. It is difficult to track them and control them. It’s difficult to understand what’s going on. Have you seen those two-year-old tickets in <a href="/2015/12/22/why-dont-you-contribute-to-open-source.html">open source projects</a> that have hundreds of comments and no deliverables? It is a mistake by their <a href="/2015/09/22/micromanagement.html">project managers</a> and ticket participants. Each ticket should be short and focused—1) a problem, 2) a refinement question, 3) a short explanation, 4) a solution, 5) closed, thanks everybody. This is an ideal scenario.</p><aside class="quote">Long-living tickets are a management nightmare</aside><p>As soon as you realize that your ticket is turning into a long discussion, try to close it even faster. How can I close it if the reporter doesn’t like my solution? Find a temporary solution that will satisfy the reporter and allow you to close the ticket. Use “TODO” in your code or dirty workarounds—they are all better than a ticket hovering for a long time.</p><p>Once you see that the solution is provided and is sufficient enough to close the ticket, ask its reporter to close it. Explicitly ask for that; don’t dance around with “looks like this solution may be accepted, if you don’t mind.” Be explicit in your intention to close the ticket and move on. Try this: “@jeff, please close the ticket if you don’t have any further questions.”</p><h2 id="3-dont-close-it">3. Don’t Close It!</h2><p>Every time you raise a bug and create a new ticket, you consume project resources. Every bug report means money spent on the project: 1) money for your time spent finding the problem and reporting it; 2) for the time of the <a href="/2016/05/24/who-is-project-manager.html">project manager</a> who is working with the ticket and finding who will fix it; 3) for the time of the ticket solver, who is trying to understand your report and provide a solution; and also 4) for the time of everybody else who will participate in the discussion.</p><aside class="quote">Anything would work, but not nothing</aside><p>If you close the ticket without a problem being properly solved, you put this money into the <strong>trash</strong> bin. Once the ticket is started, there is no way back. We can’t just say, “Nah, ignore it; it’s not important anymore.” Your ticket already consumed project time and budget resources, and in order to turn them into something useful, you have to make sure that <em>some</em> solution is delivered.</p><p>It can be a temporary solution. It can be a single line change in the project documentation. It can be a TODO marker in the code saying that “we are aware of the problem but won’t fix it because we’re lazy.” Anything would work, but not nothing.</p><p>Look at it from a different perspective. When you started that ticket, you had something in mind. Something was not right with the product. That’s why you reported a bug. If you close the ticket without anyone even touching that place of code, someone else will have the same concern in a few days or a few years. And then the project will have to <strong>pay again</strong> for a similar ticket or discussion of the same problem. Even if you’re convinced that the issue you found in the code is not really an issue, ask a ticket resolver to document it right in the source code in order to prevent such confusion from happening again in the future.</p><h2 id="4-avoid-noiseaddress-your-comments">4. Avoid Noise—Address Your Comments</h2><p>Every time you post a message to the ticket, address it to someone. Otherwise, if you post just because you want to express your opinion, your comments become communication <strong>noise</strong>. Remember, a ticket is a conversation between two people—one of them reported an issue and the other one is trying to fix it. Comments like, “How about we try another approach” or “I remember I had a similar issue some time ago” are very annoying and distracting. Let’s be honest, nobody really needs or cares about “opinions.” All we need in a ticket is a solution(s).</p><aside class="quote">Don't pollute the air with generic opinions</aside><p>If you think the ticket should be closed because the introduced solution is good enough, address your comment to the ticket reporter. And start it with “@jeff, I think the solution you’ve got already is good enough, because…” This way, you will help the assigned to close the ticket and move on.</p><p>If you think the solution is wrong, address your comment to the assigned of the ticket, starting with “@jeff, I believe your solution is not good enough because…” This way, you will help the ticket reporter keep the ticket open until a proper solution comes up.</p><p>Again, don’t pollute the air with generic opinions. Instead, be very specific and take sides—you either like the solution and want the ticket to be closed, or you don’t like it and want the ticket to stay open. Everything in between is just making the situation more complex and isn’t helping the project at all.</p><h2 id="5-report-when-it-is-broken">5. Report When It Is Broken</h2><p>I think it is obvious, but I will reiterate: Every bug has to be reproducible. Every time you <a href="/2018/04/24/right-way-to-report-bugs.html">report a bug</a>, you should explain how exactly the product is broken. Yes, it is your job to prove that the software doesn’t work as intended, or is not documented properly, or doesn’t satisfy the <a href="/2015/11/10/ten-mistakes-in-specs.html">requirements</a>, etc.</p><p>Every bug report should follow the same simple formula: “This is what we <em>have</em>, this is what we <em>should have</em> instead, so fix it.” Every ticket, be it a bug, a task, a question, or a suggestion, should be formatted in this way. By submitting it, you’re asking the project to move from point A to point B. Something is not right at point A, and it will be much better for all of us to be at that point B. So it’s obvious that you have to explain where these points A and B are. It is highly desirable if you can explain how to get there—how to reproduce a problem and how to fix it.</p><aside class="quote">Your job, as a ticket reporter, is to draw that line from point A to point B</aside><p>Even when you have a question, you should also follow that format. If you have a question, it means the project documentation is not sufficient enough for you to find an answer there. This is what is broken. You should ask for a fix. So instead of reporting, “How should I use class X?,” say something like, “The current documentation is not complete; it doesn’t explain how I should use class X. Please fix.”</p><p>If you can’t explain how to get there, say so in the ticket: “I see that this class doesn’t work as it should, but I don’t know how to reproduce the problem and how to fix it.” This will give everybody a clear message that you are aware that your <a href="/2018/04/24/right-way-to-report-bugs.html">bug report</a> is not perfect. The first step for its resolver will be to refine the problem and find a way to reproduce it. If such a replica can’t be found, obviously your bug will be forced into closing.</p><p>Let me reiterate again: Every ticket is dragging the project from point A, where something is not right, to point B, where it is fixed.

Try &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=line+of+code+metric&quot;&gt;to google&lt;/a&gt; it yourself and you’ll find tons of articles bad-mouthing about its counter-effectiveness and destructiveness for a software development process. The main argument is that we can’t measure the progress of programming by the number of lines of code written. Probably the most famous quote is attributed to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Gates&quot;&gt;Bill Gates&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Measuring programming progress by lines of code is like measuring aircraft building progress by weight&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Basically, this means that certain parts of the aircraft will take much more effort at the same time being much lighter than others (like a central computer, for example). Instead of measuring the weight of the aircraft we should measure the effort put into it… somehow. So, here is the idea. How about we measure the amount of times programmers &lt;strong&gt;touch&lt;/strong&gt; the lines. Instead of counting the number of lines we’ll count how many times they were actually modified—we can get this information from Git (or any other SCM). The more you touch that part of the aircraft—the more effort you spent on it, right?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;!--more--&gt; &lt;p&gt;I called it Hits-of-Code (HoC) and created a small tool to help us calculate this number in just one line. It’s a &lt;a href=&quot;https://rubygems.org/gems/hoc&quot;&gt;Ruby gem&lt;/a&gt;, install it and run:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;$ gem install hoc $ hoc &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;54687&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;The number 54687 is a total number of Hits-of-Code in your code base. The principle behind this number is primitive—every time a line of code is modified, created or deleted in a Git commit, the counter increments.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The main reason why this metric is better than LoC is that it is much better aligned with the actual effort invested into the code base. Here is why.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;it-always-increments&quot;&gt;It Always Increments&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The HoC metric always goes up. Today it can not be lower than it was yesterday—just like the effort, it always increments. Lines-of-Code is not acting like this. You may have a huge code base today, but after refactoring it will become much smaller. The number of lines of code is decreased. Does it mean you are less effective? Definitely not, but the LoC metric says so, to a non-programmer. A project &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/09/22/micromanagement.html&quot;&gt;manager&lt;/a&gt;, for example, may decide that since the size of the code base stayed the same over the last month, the team is not working.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;HoC doesn’t have this counter-intuitive effect. Instead, HoC grows together with your every commit. The more you work on the code base, the bigger the HoC. It doesn’t matter how big or small the absolute size of the your product. What matters is how much effort you put into it. That’s why HoC is very intuitive and may be used as a measurement of software development progress.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;unprintable&quot;&gt;&lt;object data=&quot;https://www.yegor256.com/gnuplot/2014/11/hoc-vs-loc.svg&quot; type=&quot;image/svg+xml&quot; itemprop=&quot;image&quot; style=&quot;width:600px;max-width:100%;&quot; alt=&quot;The figure&quot;&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Look at this 18-month graph; it shows both metrics together. I used the same Java code base of &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/yegor256/rultor&quot;&gt;rultor&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/07/24/rultor-automated-merging.html&quot;&gt;DevOps assistant&lt;/a&gt;. The code base experienced a major refactoring a few months ago, as you see on the graph. I think it is obvious which metric on this graph tells us more about the efforts being invested into the product.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;it-is-objective&quot;&gt;It Is Objective&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;For HoC it doesn’t matter how big the absolute size of the code base, but only how big your relative contribution to it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Let’s say, you have 300K lines of code and 95% of them were copy-pasted from some third-party libraries (by the way, it is a very common and terrible practice—to keep third-party code inside your own repository). The amount of lines of code will be big, but the actual custom code part will be relatively small. Thus, the LoC metric will be misleading—it will always show 300K with small increments or decrements around it. Everybody will have a feeling that the team is working with 300K lines code base.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On the other hand, HoC will always take into account the part of code that is actually being modified. The value of HoC will be objectively correlated with the actual effort of programmers working with the code base.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;it-exposes-complexity-of-lines&quot;&gt;It Exposes Complexity of Lines&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;LoC is usually criticized for its neutrality towards code complexity. An auto-generated ORM class or a complex sorting algorithm may have the same size in terms of lines of code, but the first takes seconds to write, while the second may take weeks or months. That’s why lines of code is usually considered a false metric.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hits-of-Code takes complexity into account, because the longer you work with that sorting algorithm the more modifications you make to its lines. Well, this statement is true if you use Git regularly and commit your changes frequently—that is how you tell Git about your work progress.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Finally, look at &lt;a href=&quot;http://at.teamed.io/portfolio.html&quot;&gt;this list of open projects&lt;/a&gt; completed by our team over the last few years. Every project has two metrics: Lines-of-Code and Hits-of-Code. It is interesting to see how relatively small projects have very big (over a million) HoC numbers. This immediately reminds me how much time we invested into it and how old they are.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I used the HoC metric in this analysis: &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/04/11/cost-of-loc.html&quot;&gt;How much do you pay per line of code?&lt;/a&gt;. That post compares a traditional project that paid $3.98 per HoC and an &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/12/22/why-dont-you-contribute-to-open-source.html&quot;&gt;open source&lt;/a&gt; one, managed by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zerocracy.com&quot;&gt;Zerocracy&lt;/a&gt;, that paid ¢13.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;My conclusion is that this Hits-of-Code metric can be used as a tool of progress tracking in a software development project. Moreover, it can be used for estimations of team size, project budget, development schedule and so forth. Obviously, LoC can’t be the only metric, but in combination with others it may greatly help in estimating, planning and tracking.&lt;/p&gt; " /> <meta name="keywords" content="next, path, output, content, previous, url, relative_path, id, collection, excerpt, draft, categories, layout, title, date, tags, description, keywords, slug, ext" /> <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1"/> <meta name="google-site-verification" content="JEj_gQr2CPe2QKGw8XdMz0R7VboQIUbX3FlM-lwTq-8" /> <meta name="author" content="Yegor Bugayenko"> <meta name="article:published_time" content="2014-11-14 00:00:00 +0000"> <meta name="og:site_name" content="Yegor Bugayenko"/> <meta name="og:type" content="article" /> <meta name="og:locale" content="en_US" /> <meta name="twitter:account_id" content="4503599630178231" /> <meta name="twitter:creator" content="@yegor256"/> <meta name="twitter:site" content="@yegor256"/> <meta name="twitter:title" property="og:title" content="Hits-of-Code Instead of SLoC"/> <meta name="twitter:description" property="og:description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_lines_of_code&quot;&gt;Lines-of-Code&lt;/a&gt; (aka SLoC) is a metric with a terrible reputation.

It’s a &lt;a href=&quot;https://rubygems.org/gems/hoc&quot;&gt;Ruby gem&lt;/a&gt;, install it and run:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;$ gem install hoc $ hoc &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;54687&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;The number 54687 is a total number of Hits-of-Code in your code base. The principle behind this number is primitive—every time a line of code is modified, created or deleted in a Git commit, the counter increments.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The main reason why this metric is better than LoC is that it is much better aligned with the actual effort invested into the code base. Here is why.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;it-always-increments&quot;&gt;It Always Increments&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The HoC metric always goes up. Today it can not be lower than it was yesterday—just like the effort, it always increments. Lines-of-Code is not acting like this. You may have a huge code base today, but after refactoring it will become much smaller. The number of lines of code is decreased. Does it mean you are less effective? Definitely not, but the LoC metric says so, to a non-programmer. A project &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/09/22/micromanagement.html&quot;&gt;manager&lt;/a&gt;, for example, may decide that since the size of the code base stayed the same over the last month, the team is not working.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;HoC doesn’t have this counter-intuitive effect. Instead, HoC grows together with your every commit. The more you work on the code base, the bigger the HoC. It doesn’t matter how big or small the absolute size of the your product. What matters is how much effort you put into it. That’s why HoC is very intuitive and may be used as a measurement of software development progress.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;unprintable&quot;&gt;&lt;object data=&quot;https://www.yegor256.com/gnuplot/2014/11/hoc-vs-loc.svg&quot; type=&quot;image/svg+xml&quot; itemprop=&quot;image&quot; style=&quot;width:600px;max-width:100%;&quot; alt=&quot;The figure&quot;&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Look at this 18-month graph; it shows both metrics together. I used the same Java code base of &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/yegor256/rultor&quot;&gt;rultor&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/07/24/rultor-automated-merging.html&quot;&gt;DevOps assistant&lt;/a&gt;. The code base experienced a major refactoring a few months ago, as you see on the graph. I think it is obvious which metric on this graph tells us more about the efforts being invested into the product.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;it-is-objective&quot;&gt;It Is Objective&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;For HoC it doesn’t matter how big the absolute size of the code base, but only how big your relative contribution to it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Let’s say, you have 300K lines of code and 95% of them were copy-pasted from some third-party libraries (by the way, it is a very common and terrible practice—to keep third-party code inside your own repository). The amount of lines of code will be big, but the actual custom code part will be relatively small. Thus, the LoC metric will be misleading—it will always show 300K with small increments or decrements around it. Everybody will have a feeling that the team is working with 300K lines code base.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On the other hand, HoC will always take into account the part of code that is actually being modified. The value of HoC will be objectively correlated with the actual effort of programmers working with the code base.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;it-exposes-complexity-of-lines&quot;&gt;It Exposes Complexity of Lines&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;LoC is usually criticized for its neutrality towards code complexity. An auto-generated ORM class or a complex sorting algorithm may have the same size in terms of lines of code, but the first takes seconds to write, while the second may take weeks or months. That’s why lines of code is usually considered a false metric.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hits-of-Code takes complexity into account, because the longer you work with that sorting algorithm the more modifications you make to its lines. Well, this statement is true if you use Git regularly and commit your changes frequently—that is how you tell Git about your work progress.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Finally, look at &lt;a href=&quot;http://at.teamed.io/portfolio.html&quot;&gt;this list of open projects&lt;/a&gt; completed by our team over the last few years. Every project has two metrics: Lines-of-Code and Hits-of-Code. It is interesting to see how relatively small projects have very big (over a million) HoC numbers. This immediately reminds me how much time we invested into it and how old they are.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I used the HoC metric in this analysis: &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/04/11/cost-of-loc.html&quot;&gt;How much do you pay per line of code?&lt;/a&gt;. That post compares a traditional project that paid $3.98 per HoC and an &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/12/22/why-dont-you-contribute-to-open-source.html&quot;&gt;open source&lt;/a&gt; one, managed by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zerocracy.com&quot;&gt;Zerocracy&lt;/a&gt;, that paid ¢13.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;My conclusion is that this Hits-of-Code metric can be used as a tool of progress tracking in a software development project. Moreover, it can be used for estimations of team size, project budget, development schedule and so forth. Obviously, LoC can’t be the only metric, but in combination with others it may greatly help in estimating, planning and tracking.&lt;/p&gt; "/> <meta name="twitter:url" property="og:url"

That’s why lines of code is usually considered a false metric.</p><p>Hits-of-Code takes complexity into account, because the longer you work with that sorting algorithm the more modifications you make to its lines. Well, this statement is true if you use Git regularly and commit your changes frequently—that is how you tell Git about your work progress.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>Finally, look at <a href="http://at.teamed.io/portfolio.html">this list of open projects</a> completed by our team over the last few years. Every project has two metrics: Lines-of-Code and Hits-of-Code. It is interesting to see how relatively small projects have very big (over a million) HoC numbers. This immediately reminds me how much time we invested into it and how old they are.</p><p>I used the HoC metric in this analysis: <a href="/2014/04/11/cost-of-loc.html">How much do you pay per line of code?</a>. That post compares a traditional project that paid $3.98 per HoC and an <a href="/2015/12/22/why-dont-you-contribute-to-open-source.html">open source</a> one, managed by <a href="https://www.zerocracy.com">Zerocracy</a>, that paid ¢13.</p><p>My conclusion is that this Hits-of-Code metric can be used as a tool of progress tracking in a software development project. Moreover, it can be used for estimations of team size, project budget, development schedule and so forth. Obviously, LoC can’t be the only metric, but in combination with others it may greatly help in estimating, planning and tracking.</p></div></article></div><div class="wrapper"> <related-posts /></div><div class="disqus" role="complementary"><p class="disqus_hint"> Please, use <a href="https://help.disqus.com/commenting/what-html-tags-are-allowed-within-comments">syntax highlighting</a> in your comments, to make them more readable.</p><div id="disqus_thread" class="disqus-thread"> <a>&nbsp;</a></div><script> var disqus_config = function () { this.page.url = document.location.href.split('?')[0].split('#')[0].replace('https://', 'http://'); this.page.identifier = this.page.url; }; (function() { var d = document, s = d.createElement('script'); s.src = '//yegor256.disqus.com/embed.js'; s.setAttribute('data-timestamp', +new Date()); (d.head || d.body).appendChild(s); })(); </script> <noscript><div><p class="red"> JavaScript is disabled in your browser, that's why you can't see comments under this post.</p></div></noscript></div><div class="wrapper"> <footer class="footer"><p> &copy; <span itemscope="" itemprop="copyrightHolder" itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"> <span itemprop="name">Yegor Bugayenko</span> </span> 2014&ndash;<span itemprop="copyrightYear">2018</span></p></footer></div></section><div class="wrapper unprintable" style="text-align:center;margin-top:2em;"> <a href="http://www.sixnines.io/h/3ba1652f"> <img src="//www.sixnines.io/b/3ba1652f?style=flat" alt="sixnines availability badge"/> </a></div><script src="//code.jquery.com/jquery-1.9.0.min.js"></script> <script src="/js/all.js?c998b88f617"></script> <script>var disqus_shortname = 'yegor256';</script> <script id="dsq-count-scr" src="//yegor256.disqus.com/count.js" async="async"></script> <script> (function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){ (i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o), m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m) })(window,document,'script','//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga'); ga('create', 'UA-1963507-32', 'auto'); ga('send', 'pageview'); </script> <script> Cd=document;Cr="&"+Math.random();Cp="&s=1"; Cd.cookie="b=b";if(Cd.cookie)Cp+="&c=1"; Cp+="&t="+(new Date()).getTimezoneOffset(); if(self!=top)Cp+="&f=1"; </script> <script> if(navigator.javaEnabled())Cp+="&j=1"; </script> <script> if(typeof(screen)!='undefined')Cp+="&w="+screen.width+"&h="+ screen.height+"&d="+(screen.colorDepth?screen.colorDepth:screen.pixelDepth); </script> <script> Cd.write("<img src='//c.hit.ua/hit?i=95870&g=0&x=2"+Cp+Cr+ "&r="+escape(Cd.referrer)+"&u="+escape(window.location.href)+ "' border='0' wi"+"dth='1' he"+"ight='1'/>"); </script> <script type="application/ld+json"> { "@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Person", "name": "Yegor Bugayenko", "url": "https://www.yegor256.com", "sameAs": [ "https://www.facebook.com/yegor256", "https://instagram.com/yegor256", "https://www.linkedin.com/in/yegor256", "https://twitter.com/yegor256", "https://github.com/yegor256", "https://www.pinterest.com/yegor256/" ] } </script> </body> </html> <!DOCTYPE html> <html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/WebSite"> <head> <meta charset="utf-8"/> <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Twenty years ago, the best programmer was the one capable of fitting an entire application into a 64Kb &lt;code&gt;.COM&lt;/code&gt; file.

He wants to express his talent in the software he writes. He enjoys coding and does it mostly for fun.

He contributes to the team processes, standards, rules, education, and discipline as much as he contributes to the source code. He always makes sure that once he leaves the project his code and his ideas stay and work.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The highest satisfaction for a good designer is to see his code living its own life—being modified, improved, refactored and eventually retired. A designer sees himself as a parent of the code—once it is old enough to walk and talk, it has to live its own life.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;the-future&quot;&gt;The Future&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you consider yourself a hacker, I believe it’s time to change. The time of hackers is fading out.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the near future we will probably even stop thinking in terms of “hardware” and will run our applications in elastic computational platforms with unlimited amounts of memory, CPU power and storage space. We will simply pay for resource utilization and almost any performance issue will just add a few extra dollars to our monthly bills. We won’t care about optimization any more.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;The best solution you can get is the most readable, maintainable, and automated; not the fastest&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;At the same time, good software engineers will become more and more expensive and will charge $500+ per hour just to check out software and give a diagnosis. Just like good lawyers or dentists.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That’s why, while developing a new software product, those who pay for it will care mostly about its maintainability. Project sponsors will understand that the best solution they can get for their money is the one that is the most readable, maintainable, and automated.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Not the fastest.&lt;/p&gt; " /> <meta name="keywords" content="next, path, output, content, previous, url, relative_path, id, collection, excerpt, draft, categories, layout, title, date, tags, description, keywords, republished, slug, ext" /> <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1"/> <meta name="google-site-verification" content="JEj_gQr2CPe2QKGw8XdMz0R7VboQIUbX3FlM-lwTq-8" /> <meta name="author" content="Yegor Bugayenko"> <meta name="article:published_time" content="2014-10-26 00:00:00 +0000"> <meta name="og:site_name" content="Yegor Bugayenko"/> <meta name="og:type" content="article" /> <meta name="og:locale" content="en_US" /> <meta name="twitter:account_id" content="4503599630178231" /> <meta name="twitter:creator" content="@yegor256"/> <meta name="twitter:site" content="@yegor256"/> <meta name="twitter:title" property="og:title" content="Are You a Hacker or a Designer?"/> <meta name="twitter:description" property="og:description" content="&lt;p&gt;Twenty years ago, the best programmer was the one capable of fitting an entire application into a 64Kb &lt;code&gt;.COM&lt;/code&gt; file.

He contributes to the team processes, standards, rules, education, and discipline as much as he contributes to the source code. He always makes sure that once he leaves the project his code and his ideas stay and work.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The highest satisfaction for a good designer is to see his code living its own life—being modified, improved, refactored and eventually retired. A designer sees himself as a parent of the code—once it is old enough to walk and talk, it has to live its own life.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;the-future&quot;&gt;The Future&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you consider yourself a hacker, I believe it’s time to change. The time of hackers is fading out.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the near future we will probably even stop thinking in terms of “hardware” and will run our applications in elastic computational platforms with unlimited amounts of memory, CPU power and storage space. We will simply pay for resource utilization and almost any performance issue will just add a few extra dollars to our monthly bills. We won’t care about optimization any more.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;The best solution you can get is the most readable, maintainable, and automated; not the fastest&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;At the same time, good software engineers will become more and more expensive and will charge $500+ per hour just to check out software and give a diagnosis. Just like good lawyers or dentists.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That’s why, while developing a new software product, those who pay for it will care mostly about its maintainability. Project sponsors will understand that the best solution they can get for their money is the one that is the most readable, maintainable, and automated.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Not the fastest.&lt;/p&gt;

This risk is huge in the software development industry, especially in &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/10/27/outsourcing-doesnt-work.html&quot;&gt;outsourcing&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.projectsmart.co.uk/docs/chaos-report.pdf&quot;&gt;Over 80%&lt;/a&gt; of all software projects fail to achieve their objectives and &lt;a href=&quot;http://thenextweb.com/insider/2014/09/25/top-20-reasons-startups-fail-report/&quot;&gt;about 30%&lt;/a&gt; of startups fail by running out of &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/04/08/revenue-may-kill-startup.html&quot;&gt;cash&lt;/a&gt;. However, very few programmers (if any) &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/05/21/avoid-software-outsourcing-disaster.html&quot;&gt;fail&lt;/a&gt; to get their monthly salaries on time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What does this tell us?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I guess it means that in all failures you—the client—will be the loser.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;time-and-material&quot;&gt;Time and Material&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;unprintable&quot;&gt;&lt;object data=&quot;https://www.yegor256.com/images/2014/10/time-and-material-contract.svg&quot; type=&quot;image/svg+xml&quot; itemprop=&quot;image&quot; style=&quot;width:500px;max-width:100%;&quot; alt=&quot;The figure&quot;&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;In T&amp;amp;M you will simply &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/06/02/how-to-estimate-software-cost.html&quot;&gt;pay and pray&lt;/a&gt;. If your programmers appear to be honest workaholics you may get lucky and get something done. As you can see from the numbers above, however, this is rarely the case. Don’t fool yourself; there won’t be any workaholics in your project. Even if you adopt &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/09/22/micromanagement.html&quot;&gt;micro-management&lt;/a&gt; and corporal &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/01/05/how-to-punish-employees.html&quot;&gt;punishment&lt;/a&gt;, your overall &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/06/02/how-to-estimate-software-cost.html&quot;&gt;costs&lt;/a&gt; will be much higher than expected and the quality will &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/05/21/avoid-software-outsourcing-disaster.html&quot;&gt;suffer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;If your programmers appear to be honest workaholics you may get lucky and get something done&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is what a monthly T&amp;amp;M invoice will look like. You will pay for the time spent by programmers pretending to be working on your project. Well, as I said above, some of them will occasionally do something useful, but overall &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/04/11/cost-of-loc.html&quot;&gt;statistics&lt;/a&gt; tell us that most of that time will be wasted.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;No matter how good or bad the code written during that month—you still have to pay the bill. How many more invoices you will get until the product is done? Nobody knows.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the end—you lose.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;fixed-price&quot;&gt;Fixed Price&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;unprintable&quot;&gt;&lt;object data=&quot;https://www.yegor256.com/images/2014/10/fixed-price-contract.svg&quot; type=&quot;image/svg+xml&quot; itemprop=&quot;image&quot; style=&quot;width:500px;max-width:100%;&quot; alt=&quot;The figure&quot;&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;In Fixed Price you will feel secure at the beginning—“the statement of work specifies everything and the price is fixed, how can I lose?” According to the statistics above, however, programmers are much smarter than their &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/01/26/happy-boss-false-objective.html&quot;&gt;clients&lt;/a&gt;. You will lose in quality. Yes, you will get something for that fixed price, but it will be a throw-away software. And when you decide to modify it, new costs will bubble up. In the end, the whole project will be &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/05/21/avoid-software-outsourcing-disaster.html&quot;&gt;ruined&lt;/a&gt; and your money will simply be turned into programmers’ salaries. This model is even more risky than T&amp;amp;M, where you at least have a chance.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Once in a while you will receive an invoice with a list of milestones reached. Every milestone will contain a certain set of features implemented in the product. Keep in mind that the primary motivation of your programmers will be to do less and charge more. Every time you ask for improvements or corrections, there will be a fight about budget. You will either give up and lose a lot of money or your team will significantly jeopardize quality, in order to stay profitable.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In either case—you lose.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;incremental-billing&quot;&gt;Incremental Billing&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;So, what is the solution? Is it possible to have win-win contracts with programmers?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;unprintable&quot;&gt;&lt;object data=&quot;https://www.yegor256.com/images/2014/10/xdsd-invoice-example.svg&quot; type=&quot;image/svg+xml&quot; itemprop=&quot;image&quot; style=&quot;width:500px;max-width:100%;&quot; alt=&quot;The figure&quot;&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Yes, &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/01/19/how-expensive-is-outsourcing.html&quot;&gt;it is&lt;/a&gt;. We call it “Incremental Billing.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Remember, in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.xdsd.org&quot;&gt;XDSD&lt;/a&gt; we work with a stream of micro-tasks, usually completed in less than an hour. Each completed task produces a new increment (aka a “release” or “version”) of software. An increment could be a bug fix, a &lt;a href=&quot;/2018/04/24/right-way-to-report-bugs.html&quot;&gt;bug report&lt;/a&gt;, a new feature or a micro-step towards any of these.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;By the end of a week you get a bill that lists every single increment delivered during the week, the amount of time spent on its development and its &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/06/02/how-to-estimate-software-cost.html&quot;&gt;total cost&lt;/a&gt;. Every increment costs you 30-60 minutes of a programmer’s time (plus our fees).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Besides that, by the end of the week, you get an updated version of a project plan, with a re-estimated budget. Thus, you see what was done so far and how much needs to be done, according to our estimate.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;How does this help you not lose/waste money? Here’s how:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;you fully control your budget&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;you pay only for the work completed&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;you track the progress with few-minutes-granularity&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;you don’t pay for meetings, chats, lunches or coffee breaks&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;programmers stay very motivated, since they are paid by result&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;there is no long-term commitment, and you can stop at any time&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;every increment passes all quality checks&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;As you can see, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.xdsd.org&quot;&gt;XDSD methodology&lt;/a&gt; not only improves the way we develop software but also fixes the flaws in the way you pay for it. Since it is a win-win model, it is beneficial for both programmers and for you—the paying project sponsor.&lt;/p&gt; " /> <meta name="keywords" content="next, path, output, content, previous, url, relative_path, id, collection, excerpt, draft, categories, layout, title, date, tags, description, keywords, slug, ext" /> <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1"/> <meta name="google-site-verification" content="JEj_gQr2CPe2QKGw8XdMz0R7VboQIUbX3FlM-lwTq-8" /> <meta name="author" content="Yegor Bugayenko"> <meta name="article:published_time" content="2014-10-21 00:00:00 +0000"> <meta name="og:site_name" content="Yegor Bugayenko"/> <meta name="og:type" content="article" /> <meta name="og:locale" content="en_US" /> <meta name="twitter:account_id" content="4503599630178231" /> <meta name="twitter:creator" content="@yegor256"/> <meta name="twitter:site" content="@yegor256"/> <meta name="twitter:title" property="og:title" content="Incremental Billing"/> <meta name="twitter:description" property="og:description" content="&lt;p&gt;When you hire a software developer (individual or a team), there are basically two types of contracts: &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed-price_contract&quot;&gt;fixed price&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_and_materials&quot;&gt;time-and-material&lt;/a&gt;.

This risk is huge in the software development industry, especially in &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/10/27/outsourcing-doesnt-work.html&quot;&gt;outsourcing&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.projectsmart.co.uk/docs/chaos-report.pdf&quot;&gt;Over 80%&lt;/a&gt; of all software projects fail to achieve their objectives and &lt;a href=&quot;http://thenextweb.com/insider/2014/09/25/top-20-reasons-startups-fail-report/&quot;&gt;about 30%&lt;/a&gt; of startups fail by running out of &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/04/08/revenue-may-kill-startup.html&quot;&gt;cash&lt;/a&gt;. However, very few programmers (if any) &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/05/21/avoid-software-outsourcing-disaster.html&quot;&gt;fail&lt;/a&gt; to get their monthly salaries on time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What does this tell us?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I guess it means that in all failures you—the client—will be the loser.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;time-and-material&quot;&gt;Time and Material&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;unprintable&quot;&gt;&lt;object data=&quot;https://www.yegor256.com/images/2014/10/time-and-material-contract.svg&quot; type=&quot;image/svg+xml&quot; itemprop=&quot;image&quot; style=&quot;width:500px;max-width:100%;&quot; alt=&quot;The figure&quot;&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;In T&amp;amp;M you will simply &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/06/02/how-to-estimate-software-cost.html&quot;&gt;pay and pray&lt;/a&gt;. If your programmers appear to be honest workaholics you may get lucky and get something done. As you can see from the numbers above, however, this is rarely the case. Don’t fool yourself; there won’t be any workaholics in your project. Even if you adopt &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/09/22/micromanagement.html&quot;&gt;micro-management&lt;/a&gt; and corporal &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/01/05/how-to-punish-employees.html&quot;&gt;punishment&lt;/a&gt;, your overall &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/06/02/how-to-estimate-software-cost.html&quot;&gt;costs&lt;/a&gt; will be much higher than expected and the quality will &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/05/21/avoid-software-outsourcing-disaster.html&quot;&gt;suffer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;If your programmers appear to be honest workaholics you may get lucky and get something done&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is what a monthly T&amp;amp;M invoice will look like. You will pay for the time spent by programmers pretending to be working on your project. Well, as I said above, some of them will occasionally do something useful, but overall &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/04/11/cost-of-loc.html&quot;&gt;statistics&lt;/a&gt; tell us that most of that time will be wasted.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;No matter how good or bad the code written during that month—you still have to pay the bill. How many more invoices you will get until the product is done? Nobody knows.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the end—you lose.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;fixed-price&quot;&gt;Fixed Price&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;unprintable&quot;&gt;&lt;object data=&quot;https://www.yegor256.com/images/2014/10/fixed-price-contract.svg&quot; type=&quot;image/svg+xml&quot; itemprop=&quot;image&quot; style=&quot;width:500px;max-width:100%;&quot; alt=&quot;The figure&quot;&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;In Fixed Price you will feel secure at the beginning—“the statement of work specifies everything and the price is fixed, how can I lose?” According to the statistics above, however, programmers are much smarter than their &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/01/26/happy-boss-false-objective.html&quot;&gt;clients&lt;/a&gt;. You will lose in quality. Yes, you will get something for that fixed price, but it will be a throw-away software. And when you decide to modify it, new costs will bubble up. In the end, the whole project will be &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/05/21/avoid-software-outsourcing-disaster.html&quot;&gt;ruined&lt;/a&gt; and your money will simply be turned into programmers’ salaries. This model is even more risky than T&amp;amp;M, where you at least have a chance.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Once in a while you will receive an invoice with a list of milestones reached. Every milestone will contain a certain set of features implemented in the product. Keep in mind that the primary motivation of your programmers will be to do less and charge more. Every time you ask for improvements or corrections, there will be a fight about budget. You will either give up and lose a lot of money or your team will significantly jeopardize quality, in order to stay profitable.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In either case—you lose.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;incremental-billing&quot;&gt;Incremental Billing&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;So, what is the solution?

We call it “Incremental Billing.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Remember, in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.xdsd.org&quot;&gt;XDSD&lt;/a&gt; we work with a stream of micro-tasks, usually completed in less than an hour. Each completed task produces a new increment (aka a “release” or “version”) of software. An increment could be a bug fix, a &lt;a href=&quot;/2018/04/24/right-way-to-report-bugs.html&quot;&gt;bug report&lt;/a&gt;, a new feature or a micro-step towards any of these.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;By the end of a week you get a bill that lists every single increment delivered during the week, the amount of time spent on its development and its &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/06/02/how-to-estimate-software-cost.html&quot;&gt;total cost&lt;/a&gt;.

This risk is huge in the software development industry, especially in <a href="/2015/10/27/outsourcing-doesnt-work.html">outsourcing</a>. <a href="http://www.projectsmart.co.uk/docs/chaos-report.pdf">Over 80%</a> of all software projects fail to achieve their objectives and <a href="http://thenextweb.com/insider/2014/09/25/top-20-reasons-startups-fail-report/">about 30%</a> of startups fail by running out of <a href="/2016/04/08/revenue-may-kill-startup.html">cash</a>. However, very few programmers (if any) <a href="/2015/05/21/avoid-software-outsourcing-disaster.html">fail</a> to get their monthly salaries on time.</p><p>What does this tell us?</p><p>I guess it means that in all failures you—the client—will be the loser.</p><h2 id="time-and-material">Time and Material</h2><figure class="unprintable"><object data="https://www.yegor256.com/images/2014/10/time-and-material-contract.svg" type="image/svg+xml" itemprop="image" style="width:500px;max-width:100%;" alt="The figure"></object></figure><p>In T&amp;M you will simply <a href="/2015/06/02/how-to-estimate-software-cost.html">pay and pray</a>. If your programmers appear to be honest workaholics you may get lucky and get something done. As you can see from the numbers above, however, this is rarely the case. Don’t fool yourself; there won’t be any workaholics in your project. Even if you adopt <a href="/2015/09/22/micromanagement.html">micro-management</a> and corporal <a href="/2016/01/05/how-to-punish-employees.html">punishment</a>, your overall <a href="/2015/06/02/how-to-estimate-software-cost.html">costs</a> will be much higher than expected and the quality will <a href="/2015/05/21/avoid-software-outsourcing-disaster.html">suffer</a>.</p><aside class="quote">If your programmers appear to be honest workaholics you may get lucky and get something done</aside><p>This is what a monthly T&amp;M invoice will look like. You will pay for the time spent by programmers pretending to be working on your project. Well, as I said above, some of them will occasionally do something useful, but overall <a href="/2014/04/11/cost-of-loc.html">statistics</a> tell us that most of that time will be wasted.</p><p>No matter how good or bad the code written during that month—you still have to pay the bill.

You will lose in quality. Yes, you will get something for that fixed price, but it will be a throw-away software. And when you decide to modify it, new costs will bubble up. In the end, the whole project will be <a href="/2015/05/21/avoid-software-outsourcing-disaster.html">ruined</a> and your money will simply be turned into programmers’ salaries. This model is even more risky than T&amp;M, where you at least have a chance.</p><p>Once in a while you will receive an invoice with a list of milestones reached. Every milestone will contain a certain set of features implemented in the product. Keep in mind that the primary motivation of your programmers will be to do less and charge more. Every time you ask for improvements or corrections, there will be a fight about budget. You will either give up and lose a lot of money or your team will significantly jeopardize quality, in order to stay profitable.</p><p>In either case—you lose.</p><h2 id="incremental-billing">Incremental Billing</h2><p>So, what is the solution?

We call it “Incremental Billing.”</p><p>Remember, in <a href="https://www.xdsd.org">XDSD</a> we work with a stream of micro-tasks, usually completed in less than an hour. Each completed task produces a new increment (aka a “release” or “version”) of software. An increment could be a bug fix, a <a href="/2018/04/24/right-way-to-report-bugs.html">bug report</a>, a new feature or a micro-step towards any of these.</p><p>By the end of a week you get a bill that lists every single increment delivered during the week, the amount of time spent on its development and its <a href="/2015/06/02/how-to-estimate-software-cost.html">total cost</a>. Every increment costs you 30-60 minutes of a programmer’s time (plus our fees).</p><p>Besides that, by the end of the week, you get an updated version of a project plan, with a re-estimated budget.

We create it during our &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/10/06/software-project-lifecycle.html&quot;&gt;Thinking&lt;/a&gt; phase. Even though the document is as short as two pages of English text, its development is the most painstaking task in the whole project.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are a few tricks and recommendations which I’d like to share.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We usually design a Product Vision in four sections: product statement, stakeholders and needs, features, and quality requirements.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;!--more--&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;product-statement&quot;&gt;Product Statement&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Product Statement is a one-paragraph declaration of intent, explaining to an absolute stranger what this product is about and what it is for. It is very similar to an &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevator_pitch&quot;&gt;elevator pitch&lt;/a&gt;. The Statement must answer these questions, preferably in this specific order:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;Who is the customer?&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;What does she want?&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;What is the market offering now?&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;What is wrong with existing offers?&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;How will our product fix this?&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;You should answer all these questions in less than 60 words altogether. If you need more words, something is wrong with your understanding of the product under development. If you can answer them in 20 words, your product will conquer the world.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;An eventual invention of a cancer vaccine will make millions of people healthier, but will also make thousands of oncologists jobless&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;By the way, don’t confuse a Product Statement with a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mission_statement&quot;&gt;Mission&lt;/a&gt;, which is a much broader declaration of an overall goal of your business. You may have a hundred products but only a single mission. For example, Disney &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lifehack.org/articles/work/20-sample-vision-statement-for-the-new-startup.html&quot;&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; that its mission is: “to make people happy.” They’ve got hundreds of products that help them accomplish this mission. And each product has its own Product Statement.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I find these articles helpful: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scrumalliance.org/community/articles/2009/january/the-product-vision&quot;&gt;The Product Vision&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://platinumedge.com/blog/agile-artifacts-product-vision-statement&quot;&gt;Agile Artifacts: The Product Vision Statement&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jamesshore.com/Agile-Book/vision.html&quot;&gt;The Art of Agile Development: Vision&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;stakeholders-and-needs&quot;&gt;Stakeholders and Needs&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;This section must list everybody whose life will be affected by the product (positively or negatively). Your list of stakeholders may include: sponsors, developers, users, competitors, government, banks, web hosting providers, Apple Store, hackers, etc.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is very important to list both positive and negative stakeholders. If your product is going to automate some routine manual operations, don’t forget that someone will be made redundant because of it. No matter how “good” your product is, there is always an “evil” side. The invention of the iPhone made millions of people happy, but also caused a lot of trouble for Nokia and Blackberry. An eventual invention of a cancer vaccine will make millions of people healthier, but will also make thousands of oncologists jobless. My point is that any project has both positive and negative stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Each stakeholder must have a list of needs. They have to be simple and straight forward, like “earn money,” “increase profit,” “share photos,” or “host a website.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I would recommend defining one or two needs for each stakeholder. If there are more than three, think again—do you really understand what your stakeholders need?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Your project will be considered successful if you &lt;strong&gt;satisfy&lt;/strong&gt; all the needs of all your positive stakeholders and &lt;strong&gt;neutralize&lt;/strong&gt; negative ones.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sebokwiki.org/wiki/Stakeholder_Needs_and_Requirements&quot;&gt;Stakeholder Needs and Requirements&lt;/a&gt; article from SEBOK will be helpful.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;actors-and-features&quot;&gt;Actors and Features&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;In this section we list &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_%28UML%29&quot;&gt;actors&lt;/a&gt; (entities communicating with the product) and the key functionalities they use. This is the most abstract definition of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_requirement&quot;&gt;functional requirements&lt;/a&gt; of the product. It doesn’t need to be detailed. Instead, it has to be very high-level and abstract. For example, this is how our interaction with a well-known product may be described in two lines:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;User can post tweets, read tweets of his friends, follow new friends and re-tweet their tweets.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Is it clear for a stranger what we’re talking about here? Absolutely not—what is a “tweet,” what does it mean to “follow” and what is a “re-tweet?” These questions have no answers in the Product Vision document, but it’s clear that a user will have four main features available. All other features will be similar to those.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;If you can't fit all features into 2-3 lines, reconsider your understanding of the product&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;Twitter is a multi-billion dollar business with a multi-million dollar product. However, we managed to explain its key features in just two lines of text. You should do the same with your product. If you can’t fit all its features into just two-three lines, reconsider your understanding of the product you’re going to develop. Also, read about &lt;a href=&quot;http://hbswk.hbs.edu/archive/5325.html&quot;&gt;“feature bloat dilemma.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Each actor must have at least three and at most six features. If there are more, you should group them somehow. If there are less, break them into smaller and more detailed features.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;quality-requirements&quot;&gt;Quality Requirements&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;This section lists all important non-functional requirements. Any product may have hundreds of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-functional_requirement&quot;&gt;quality requirements&lt;/a&gt;, as well as hundreds of features. However, a Product Vision document must be focused on the most important ones. Consider some examples:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Any web page must open in less than 300ms. Total cost of ownership must be less than $5000/mo. Mobile app must be tailored for 10+ popular screen sizes. Mean time to recover must be less than 2 hours. DB must be scalable up to 5Tb without cost increases.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;It's better to say nothing than set false or ambiguous goals&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is also very important to keep requirements &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/11/10/ten-mistakes-in-specs.html&quot;&gt;measurable&lt;/a&gt; (like each of these examples). Every line in this section is a message to product developers. They will read this document in order to understand what is most important to the sponsor of the project. For example, these quality requirements are useless: “user interface must be attractive,” “web site must be fast” or “the system must be stable.” They are not measurable or testable. All they do is &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/11/10/ten-mistakes-in-specs.html&quot;&gt;distract&lt;/a&gt; developers. If you can’t make a strict and measurable statement about your quality objectives, don’t write anything. It’s better to say nothing than set false or ambiguous goals here.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Try to keep this section short. There should be six quality requirements, at most.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;remove-noise&quot;&gt;Remove Noise&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Every section must be no more than twenty lines in length. Even if you’re developing a Google killer with a $50 million dollar budget, your Vision document must be as short as two pages.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For most of my &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/01/26/happy-boss-false-objective.html&quot;&gt;clients&lt;/a&gt; this is a very complex and brain damaging task. They usually come to us with a 50-page document explaining their business ideas with all the important details. From this document, we should only extract information that really makes a difference.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Product Vision document must keep its reader on the highest level of abstraction. The document must take less than a minute to read, from start to finish.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you can’t keep it &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/11/10/ten-mistakes-in-specs.html&quot;&gt;short&lt;/a&gt;—you don’t understand your product well enough.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;example&quot;&gt;Example&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Here is an example of a very simple Product Vision for a Facebook killer:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Statement Facebook doesn&amp;#39;t allow users to purchase &amp;quot;likes&amp;quot;, our social network will have this. Stakeholders and Needs Sponsor: to raise investments. Developer: to earn money by programming. Users: to share photos and purchase popularity. Bank: to make commission on every purchase. Government: to protect society against abusive content. Competitors: to wipe us off the market. Actors and Features User can create account, upload photos, share photos, send personal messages, like other photos, purchase likes. Admin can ban user accounts, view summary reports, authorize credit card transactions, configure system parameters, monitor server resource usage. Bank can process credit card transactions. Quality Requirements Any page must open in less than 300ms. Availability must be over 99.999%. Test coverage must be over 80%. Development pipeline must be fully automated. Interfaces must include web site and iOS/Android app.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;diplomacy&quot;&gt;Diplomacy&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;We follow all these recommendations in our projects, in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zerocracy.com&quot;&gt;Zerocracy&lt;/a&gt;. You can use them in your projects as well, but keep in mind that the process of defining a Product Vision could be very painful. You may sometimes &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/01/26/happy-boss-false-objective.html&quot;&gt;offend&lt;/a&gt; a client by over-simplifying their “great” business idea. “Really? I am ready to pay $250,000 for something awesome and you’re telling me that you’ve only got ten lines for it? Huh?”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Don't allow your client to force you to bloat the Product Vision&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;To work around this situation, split the client’s documentation into two parts. The first part will fit into the Product Vision document; the second one will be called “supplementary documentation” and will contain all that valuable information you’ve got from the client. You may use that documentation later, during the course of product development.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But don’t cut corners. Don’t allow your &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/01/26/happy-boss-false-objective.html&quot;&gt;client&lt;/a&gt; (or anyone else) to force you to bloat the Product Vision.

We create it during our &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/10/06/software-project-lifecycle.html&quot;&gt;Thinking&lt;/a&gt; phase. Even though the document is as short as two pages of English text, its development is the most painstaking task in the whole project.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are a few tricks and recommendations which I’d like to share.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We usually design a Product Vision in four sections: product statement, stakeholders and needs, features, and quality requirements.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;!--more--&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;product-statement&quot;&gt;Product Statement&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Product Statement is a one-paragraph declaration of intent, explaining to an absolute stranger what this product is about and what it is for. It is very similar to an &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevator_pitch&quot;&gt;elevator pitch&lt;/a&gt;. The Statement must answer these questions, preferably in this specific order:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;Who is the customer?&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;What does she want?&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;What is the market offering now?&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;What is wrong with existing offers?&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;How will our product fix this?&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;You should answer all these questions in less than 60 words altogether. If you need more words, something is wrong with your understanding of the product under development. If you can answer them in 20 words, your product will conquer the world.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;An eventual invention of a cancer vaccine will make millions of people healthier, but will also make thousands of oncologists jobless&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;By the way, don’t confuse a Product Statement with a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mission_statement&quot;&gt;Mission&lt;/a&gt;, which is a much broader declaration of an overall goal of your business. You may have a hundred products but only a single mission. For example, Disney &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lifehack.org/articles/work/20-sample-vision-statement-for-the-new-startup.html&quot;&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; that its mission is: “to make people happy.” They’ve got hundreds of products that help them accomplish this mission. And each product has its own Product Statement.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I find these articles helpful: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scrumalliance.org/community/articles/2009/january/the-product-vision&quot;&gt;The Product Vision&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://platinumedge.com/blog/agile-artifacts-product-vision-statement&quot;&gt;Agile Artifacts: The Product Vision Statement&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jamesshore.com/Agile-Book/vision.html&quot;&gt;The Art of Agile Development: Vision&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;stakeholders-and-needs&quot;&gt;Stakeholders and Needs&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;This section must list everybody whose life will be affected by the product (positively or negatively). Your list of stakeholders may include: sponsors, developers, users, competitors, government, banks, web hosting providers, Apple Store, hackers, etc.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is very important to list both positive and negative stakeholders. If your product is going to automate some routine manual operations, don’t forget that someone will be made redundant because of it. No matter how “good” your product is, there is always an “evil” side. The invention of the iPhone made millions of people happy, but also caused a lot of trouble for Nokia and Blackberry. An eventual invention of a cancer vaccine will make millions of people healthier, but will also make thousands of oncologists jobless. My point is that any project has both positive and negative stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Each stakeholder must have a list of needs. They have to be simple and straight forward, like “earn money,” “increase profit,” “share photos,” or “host a website.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I would recommend defining one or two needs for each stakeholder. If there are more than three, think again—do you really understand what your stakeholders need?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Your project will be considered successful if you &lt;strong&gt;satisfy&lt;/strong&gt; all the needs of all your positive stakeholders and &lt;strong&gt;neutralize&lt;/strong&gt; negative ones.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sebokwiki.org/wiki/Stakeholder_Needs_and_Requirements&quot;&gt;Stakeholder Needs and Requirements&lt;/a&gt; article from SEBOK will be helpful.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;actors-and-features&quot;&gt;Actors and Features&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;In this section we list &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_%28UML%29&quot;&gt;actors&lt;/a&gt; (entities communicating with the product) and the key functionalities they use. This is the most abstract definition of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_requirement&quot;&gt;functional requirements&lt;/a&gt; of the product. It doesn’t need to be detailed. Instead, it has to be very high-level and abstract. For example, this is how our interaction with a well-known product may be described in two lines:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;User can post tweets, read tweets of his friends, follow new friends and re-tweet their tweets.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Is it clear for a stranger what we’re talking about here? Absolutely not—what is a “tweet,” what does it mean to “follow” and what is a “re-tweet?” These questions have no answers in the Product Vision document, but it’s clear that a user will have four main features available. All other features will be similar to those.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;If you can't fit all features into 2-3 lines, reconsider your understanding of the product&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;Twitter is a multi-billion dollar business with a multi-million dollar product. However, we managed to explain its key features in just two lines of text. You should do the same with your product. If you can’t fit all its features into just two-three lines, reconsider your understanding of the product you’re going to develop. Also, read about &lt;a href=&quot;http://hbswk.hbs.edu/archive/5325.html&quot;&gt;“feature bloat dilemma.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Each actor must have at least three and at most six features. If there are more, you should group them somehow. If there are less, break them into smaller and more detailed features.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;quality-requirements&quot;&gt;Quality Requirements&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;This section lists all important non-functional requirements. Any product may have hundreds of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-functional_requirement&quot;&gt;quality requirements&lt;/a&gt;, as well as hundreds of features. However, a Product Vision document must be focused on the most important ones. Consider some examples:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Any web page must open in less than 300ms. Total cost of ownership must be less than $5000/mo. Mobile app must be tailored for 10+ popular screen sizes. Mean time to recover must be less than 2 hours. DB must be scalable up to 5Tb without cost increases.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;It's better to say nothing than set false or ambiguous goals&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is also very important to keep requirements &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/11/10/ten-mistakes-in-specs.html&quot;&gt;measurable&lt;/a&gt; (like each of these examples). Every line in this section is a message to product developers. They will read this document in order to understand what is most important to the sponsor of the project. For example, these quality requirements are useless: “user interface must be attractive,” “web site must be fast” or “the system must be stable.” They are not measurable or testable. All they do is &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/11/10/ten-mistakes-in-specs.html&quot;&gt;distract&lt;/a&gt; developers. If you can’t make a strict and measurable statement about your quality objectives, don’t write anything. It’s better to say nothing than set false or ambiguous goals here.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Try to keep this section short. There should be six quality requirements, at most.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;remove-noise&quot;&gt;Remove Noise&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Every section must be no more than twenty lines in length. Even if you’re developing a Google killer with a $50 million dollar budget, your Vision document must be as short as two pages.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For most of my &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/01/26/happy-boss-false-objective.html&quot;&gt;clients&lt;/a&gt; this is a very complex and brain damaging task. They usually come to us with a 50-page document explaining their business ideas with all the important details. From this document, we should only extract information that really makes a difference.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Product Vision document must keep its reader on the highest level of abstraction. The document must take less than a minute to read, from start to finish.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you can’t keep it &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/11/10/ten-mistakes-in-specs.html&quot;&gt;short&lt;/a&gt;—you don’t understand your product well enough.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;example&quot;&gt;Example&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Here is an example of a very simple Product Vision for a Facebook killer:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Statement Facebook doesn&amp;#39;t allow users to purchase &amp;quot;likes&amp;quot;, our social network will have this. Stakeholders and Needs Sponsor: to raise investments. Developer: to earn money by programming. Users: to share photos and purchase popularity. Bank: to make commission on every purchase. Government: to protect society against abusive content. Competitors: to wipe us off the market. Actors and Features User can create account, upload photos, share photos, send personal messages, like other photos, purchase likes. Admin can ban user accounts, view summary reports, authorize credit card transactions, configure system parameters, monitor server resource usage. Bank can process credit card transactions. Quality Requirements Any page must open in less than 300ms. Availability must be over 99.999%. Test coverage must be over 80%. Development pipeline must be fully automated. Interfaces must include web site and iOS/Android app.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;diplomacy&quot;&gt;Diplomacy&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;We follow all these recommendations in our projects, in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zerocracy.com&quot;&gt;Zerocracy&lt;/a&gt;. You can use them in your projects as well, but keep in mind that the process of defining a Product Vision could be very painful. You may sometimes &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/01/26/happy-boss-false-objective.html&quot;&gt;offend&lt;/a&gt; a client by over-simplifying their “great” business idea. “Really? I am ready to pay $250,000 for something awesome and you’re telling me that you’ve only got ten lines for it? Huh?”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Don't allow your client to force you to bloat the Product Vision&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;To work around this situation, split the client’s documentation into two parts. The first part will fit into the Product Vision document; the second one will be called “supplementary documentation” and will contain all that valuable information you’ve got from the client. You may use that documentation later, during the course of product development.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But don’t cut corners. Don’t allow your &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/01/26/happy-boss-false-objective.html&quot;&gt;client&lt;/a&gt; (or anyone else) to force you to bloat the Product Vision. The document has to be very short and explicit.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;No lyrics, only &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/11/10/ten-mistakes-in-specs.html&quot;&gt;statements&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;PS.

We create it during our <a href="/2014/10/06/software-project-lifecycle.html">Thinking</a> phase. Even though the document is as short as two pages of English text, its development is the most painstaking task in the whole project.</p><p>There are a few tricks and recommendations which I’d like to share.</p><p>We usually design a Product Vision in four sections: product statement, stakeholders and needs, features, and quality requirements.</p><h2 id="product-statement">Product Statement</h2><p>Product Statement is a one-paragraph declaration of intent, explaining to an absolute stranger what this product is about and what it is for. It is very similar to an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevator_pitch">elevator pitch</a>. The Statement must answer these questions, preferably in this specific order:</p><ol> <li>Who is the customer?</li> <li>What does she want?</li> <li>What is the market offering now?</li> <li>What is wrong with existing offers?</li> <li>How will our product fix this?</li> </ol><p>You should answer all these questions in less than 60 words altogether. If you need more words, something is wrong with your understanding of the product under development. If you can answer them in 20 words, your product will conquer the world.</p><aside class="quote">An eventual invention of a cancer vaccine will make millions of people healthier, but will also make thousands of oncologists jobless</aside><p>By the way, don’t confuse a Product Statement with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mission_statement">Mission</a>, which is a much broader declaration of an overall goal of your business. You may have a hundred products but only a single mission. For example, Disney <a href="http://www.lifehack.org/articles/work/20-sample-vision-statement-for-the-new-startup.html">says</a> that its mission is: “to make people happy.” They’ve got hundreds of products that help them accomplish this mission.

Your list of stakeholders may include: sponsors, developers, users, competitors, government, banks, web hosting providers, Apple Store, hackers, etc.</p><p>It is very important to list both positive and negative stakeholders. If your product is going to automate some routine manual operations, don’t forget that someone will be made redundant because of it. No matter how “good” your product is, there is always an “evil” side. The invention of the iPhone made millions of people happy, but also caused a lot of trouble for Nokia and Blackberry. An eventual invention of a cancer vaccine will make millions of people healthier, but will also make thousands of oncologists jobless.

Do you need one? Well, most &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/11/21/ringelmann-effect-vs-agile.html&quot;&gt;agile teams&lt;/a&gt; do not define such a role explicitly and work in a &lt;em&gt;democratic&lt;/em&gt; mode. Every important technical decision is discussed with the entire team, and the most voted for solution wins. When such a team eventually decides to put a “software architect” badge on someone’s t-shirt, the most &lt;em&gt;reputable&lt;/em&gt; programmer gets it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;!--more--&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;jb_picture&quot;&gt;&lt;img itemprop=&quot;image&quot; alt=&quot;Jackie Brown (1997) by Quentin Tarantino&quot; src=&quot;/images/2014/10/jackie-brown.jpg&quot; longdesc=&quot;#f41988de&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption id=&quot;f41988de&quot;&gt;Jackie Brown (1997) by Quentin Tarantino&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;The badge rarely changes his responsibilities, though. After all, the team stays the same and enjoys having technical discussions together, involving everyone. In the end, a software architect is more of a &lt;em&gt;status&lt;/em&gt; than a role with explicitly defined responsibilities. It is a sign of respect, paid by other team players to the oldest and the most authoritative one among them.

Of course, an architect usually knows more than others and is able to communicate his knowledge with diplomacy and pedagogy when required. An architect is usually one of the smartest guys on the team.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;An architect is the one who takes the blame for the quality&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is not, however, &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; makes him/her an architect.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And this is not what the team needs. My definition of a software architect is this:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;An &lt;em&gt;architect&lt;/em&gt; is the one who takes the &lt;em&gt;blame&lt;/em&gt; for the &lt;em&gt;quality&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;youtube&quot;&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNSezrlemsY&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;box&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://i.ytimg.com/vi/PNSezrlemsY/mqdefault.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;YouTube video #PNSezrlemsY&quot; /&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;play&quot;&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;icon icon-play&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;div&gt;Hacker vs Designer Mentality; 13 April 2015.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;You can replace “blame” with accountability or responsibility.

Do you need one? Well, most &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/11/21/ringelmann-effect-vs-agile.html&quot;&gt;agile teams&lt;/a&gt; do not define such a role explicitly and work in a &lt;em&gt;democratic&lt;/em&gt; mode. Every important technical decision is discussed with the entire team, and the most voted for solution wins. When such a team eventually decides to put a “software architect” badge on someone’s t-shirt, the most &lt;em&gt;reputable&lt;/em&gt; programmer gets it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;!--more--&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;jb_picture&quot;&gt;&lt;img itemprop=&quot;image&quot; alt=&quot;Jackie Brown (1997) by Quentin Tarantino&quot; src=&quot;/images/2014/10/jackie-brown.jpg&quot; longdesc=&quot;#f41988de&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption id=&quot;f41988de&quot;&gt;Jackie Brown (1997) by Quentin Tarantino&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;The badge rarely changes his responsibilities, though. After all, the team stays the same and enjoys having technical discussions together, involving everyone. In the end, a software architect is more of a &lt;em&gt;status&lt;/em&gt; than a role with explicitly defined responsibilities. It is a sign of respect, paid by other team players to the oldest and the most authoritative one among them.

I personally pay a lot of attention to &lt;a href=&quot;/2017/04/11/flexibility-equates-lower-quality.html&quot;&gt;quality&lt;/a&gt; of code and quality of the internal processes that connect our team.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;!--more--&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are four phases in every project I work with in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zerocracy.com&quot;&gt;Zerocracy&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thinking&lt;/strong&gt;. Here we’re trying to understand: What is the problem that the product is going to solve? We’re also investigating the product’s boundaries—who will work with the software (actors) and how will they work with it (user stories). Deliverables: &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/11/10/ten-mistakes-in-specs.html&quot;&gt;specification&lt;/a&gt;. Duration: from 2 days up to 3 weeks. Participants: product owner, analyst(s), architect, &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/02/18/holacracy-autocracy.html&quot;&gt;project manager&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Building&lt;/strong&gt;. Here the software architect is creating a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_concept&quot;&gt;proof-of-concept&lt;/a&gt; (aka an &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product&quot;&gt;MVP&lt;/a&gt; or prototype or a skeleton). It is a one-man job that is done almost without any interaction with anyone else. The architect builds the product according to the specification in a very limited time frame. The result will have multiple &lt;a href=&quot;/2018/04/24/right-way-to-report-bugs.html&quot;&gt;bugs&lt;/a&gt; and open ends, but it will implement the main user story. The architect also configures &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/10/08/continuous-integration-is-dead.html&quot;&gt;continuous integration&lt;/a&gt; and delivery pipelines. Deliverables: working software. Duration: 2-5 days. Participants: architect.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fixing&lt;/strong&gt;. At this phase we are adding all the meat to the skeleton. This phase takes most of the time and budget and involves many participants. In some projects we invite up to 50 people to work, at the same time. Since we treat all inconsistencies as bugs, this phase is mostly about finding, reporting and fixing bugs, in order to stabilize the product and get it ready for market launch. We increment and release the software multiple times a day, preferably to its user champions. Deliverables: bug fixes via pull requests. Duration: from weeks to months. Participants: programmer(s), designer(s), tester(s), code reviewer(s), architect, project manager.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Using&lt;/strong&gt;. At this final phase we are launching the product to its end-users, and collecting their feedback (both positive and negative). Everything they are reporting back to us is being registered as a bug. Then, we categorize the bugs and fix them. This phase may take years, but it never involves active implementation of new features. Deliverables: bug fixes via pull requests. Duration: months. Participants: programmer(s), code reviewer(s), project manager.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;The biggest (i.e., longest and most expensive) phase is, of course, Fixing. It usually takes the majority of time (over 70%). However, the most important and risky phase is the first one—Thinking. A mistake made during Thinking will &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/06/02/how-to-estimate-software-cost.html&quot;&gt;cost&lt;/a&gt; much more than a mistake made later.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;thinking&quot;&gt;Thinking&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;badge&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.yegor256.com/images/2014/10/lifecycle-thinking.png&quot; style=&quot;width:250px;max-width:100%;&quot; alt=&quot;badge&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thinking is the first and the most important phase.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;First, we give a name to the project and create a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; repository. We try to keep all our projects (both &lt;a href=&quot;/2017/05/30/why-contribute-to-open-source.html&quot;&gt;open source&lt;/a&gt; and commercial) in GitHub. Mostly because the platform is very popular, very powerful, and really cheap (&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/pricing&quot;&gt;$7/mo&lt;/a&gt; for a set of 5 private projects). We also keep &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/08/23/communication-maturity.html&quot;&gt;all&lt;/a&gt; communication in the GitHub issue tracker.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Then, we create a simple half-page SRS document (Software Requirements Specification). Usually this is done right inside the source code, but sometimes in the GitHub &lt;code&gt;README.md&lt;/code&gt; file. What’s important is that the document should be under version control. We will modify it during the course of the project, very intensively. The &lt;code&gt;README.md&lt;/code&gt; should &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/10/20/how-we-write-product-vision.html&quot;&gt;briefly&lt;/a&gt; identify main “actors” of the system and define the product scope.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Even though it is only half a page, the creation of this initial SRS document is the most important and the most expensive task in the entire project. We pay a lot of attention to this step. Usually this document is written by one of our system analysts in direct communication with the project sponsor. We can’t afford a mistake at this step.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Then, we invite a few new system analysts to the project. These guys are responsible for turning our initial &lt;code&gt;README&lt;/code&gt; into a more complete and detailed &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/11/10/ten-mistakes-in-specs.html&quot;&gt;specification&lt;/a&gt;. They start by asking questions, submitting them one by one as GitHub issues. Every question is addressed to the product owner. Using his/her answers, system analysts modify the &lt;code&gt;README&lt;/code&gt; document. Sometimes we’re using &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/04/26/incremental-requirements-with-requs.html&quot;&gt;Requs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At the end of the Thinking phase we estimate the size of the project, in &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/11/14/hits-of-code.html&quot;&gt;Hits of Code&lt;/a&gt;. Using this HoC metric, we can roughly &lt;a href=&quot;http://at.teamed.io/calculator.html&quot;&gt;estimate a budget&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;building&quot;&gt;Building&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;badge&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.yegor256.com/images/2014/10/lifecycle-building.png&quot; style=&quot;width:250px;max-width:100%;&quot; alt=&quot;badge&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is a one-man job for &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/10/12/who-is-software-architect.html&quot;&gt;an architect&lt;/a&gt;. Every project we work on has an architect who is &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/05/11/software-architect-responsibilities.html&quot;&gt;personally responsible&lt;/a&gt; for the quality and technical decisions. We have a few brilliant engineers for this role.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Building phase is rather straight forward. The architect has to implement the solution according to the &lt;code&gt;README&lt;/code&gt;, in a few working days. No matter how big the idea and how massive the planning development, the architect still has to create (build from scratch!) the product in, say, three days.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Besides building the software itself, the architect has to configure all basic DevOps processes, including: 1) automated testing and quality control, 2) deploying and releasing pipelines, 3) repository of artifacts, 4) &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/10/08/continuous-integration-is-dead.html&quot;&gt;continuous integration&lt;/a&gt; service, etc.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The result of this phase is a working software package, deployable to its destination and available for testers. Technical &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/08/13/strict-code-quality-control.html&quot;&gt;quality requirements&lt;/a&gt; are also defined at this phase.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;More about the Building phase here: &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/08/04/nine-steps-start-software-project.html&quot;&gt;Nine Steps to Start a Software Project&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;fixing&quot;&gt;Fixing&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;badge&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.yegor256.com/images/2014/10/lifecycle-fixing.png&quot; style=&quot;width:250px;max-width:100%;&quot; alt=&quot;badge&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now it’s time to build a distributed team of programmers. First, we invite those who’ve worked on other projects and have already have proven their quality. Very often we invite new people, finding them through &lt;a href=&quot;/2017/02/14/stackoverflow-is-your-tool.html&quot;&gt;StackOverflow&lt;/a&gt;, GitHub, Upwork, and other sources. An average team size of an average project is 15-25 programmers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At this phase, we understand &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/11/24/principles-of-bug-tracking.html&quot;&gt;any inconsistency&lt;/a&gt; as a bug. If something is not clear in the documentation, or if something can be refactored for better readability, or if a function can be improved for higher performance—it is a bug to us. And &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/04/13/bugs-are-welcome.html&quot;&gt;bugs are welcome&lt;/a&gt; in our projects. We encourage everybody to report as many bugs as possible. This is how we achieve high quality.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That is why the phase is called Fixing, after all. We are reporting bugs and &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/04/12/puzzle-driven-development-by-roles.html&quot;&gt;fixing&lt;/a&gt; them. Hundreds of bugs. Sometimes thousands. The product grows in front of our very eyes, because after every bug fix we re-deploy the entire product to the production platform.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Every bug is reported, classified, discussed, and fixed in its own GitHub ticket and its own Git branch. We never allow anyone to just commit to the &lt;code&gt;master&lt;/code&gt; branch—all changes must pass through our &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/08/13/strict-code-quality-control.html&quot;&gt;quality controls&lt;/a&gt; and be merged into &lt;code&gt;master&lt;/code&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rultor.com&quot;&gt;rultor.com&lt;/a&gt;, our &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/07/24/rultor-automated-merging.html&quot;&gt;merging bot&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Also important to mention is that all communications with the product owner and between programmers happen only through GitHub issues. We &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/10/07/stop-chatting-start-coding.html&quot;&gt;never use any chats&lt;/a&gt;, Skype, emails or conferencing software. We communicate only through tickets and &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/11/03/chatbot-better-than-ui-for-microservice.html&quot;&gt;comments&lt;/a&gt; in GitHub.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;using&quot;&gt;Using&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;badge&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.yegor256.com/images/2014/10/lifecycle-using.png&quot; style=&quot;width:250px;max-width:100%;&quot; alt=&quot;badge&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is the final phase and it can take quite a long time. By now, the product is ready and is launched to the market. But we still receive &lt;a href=&quot;/2018/04/24/right-way-to-report-bugs.html&quot;&gt;bug reports&lt;/a&gt; and feature request from the product owner, and we still fix them through the same process flow as in the Fixing phase.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We try to keep this phase as quiet as possible, in terms of the amount of bugs reported and fixed. Thanks to our intensive and pro-active bug finding and fixing in the previous phase, we usually have very few problems at the Using phase.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And big feature requests? At this phase, we usually try to convert them into new projects and develop them separately, starting again from Thinking.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;BTW, the illustrations you see above are made by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.behance.net/lopesbarbara&quot;&gt;Bárbara Lopes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; " /> <meta name="keywords" content="next, path, output, content, previous, url, relative_path, id, collection, excerpt, draft, categories, layout, title, date, tags, description, keywords, slug, ext" /> <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1"/> <meta name="google-site-verification" content="JEj_gQr2CPe2QKGw8XdMz0R7VboQIUbX3FlM-lwTq-8" /> <meta name="author" content="Yegor Bugayenko"> <meta name="article:published_time" content="2014-10-06 00:00:00 +0000"> <meta name="og:site_name" content="Yegor Bugayenko"/> <meta name="og:type" content="article" /> <meta name="og:locale" content="en_US" /> <meta name="twitter:account_id" content="4503599630178231" /> <meta name="twitter:creator" content="@yegor256"/> <meta name="twitter:site" content="@yegor256"/> <meta name="twitter:title" property="og:title" content="Project Lifecycle in Zerocracy"/> <meta name="twitter:description" property="og:description" content="&lt;p&gt;In addition to being a hands-on programmer, I’m also co-founder and CTO of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zerocracy.com&quot;&gt;Zerocracy&lt;/a&gt;, a custom software development company. I play the role of a technical and management leader in all projects we work with.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;badge&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zerocracy.com&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;//www.0crat.com/svg/logo.svg&quot; style=&quot;width:100px;max-width:100%;&quot; alt=&quot;badge&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;I wrote this article for those who’re interested in hiring me and/or my team. This article will demonstrate what happens from day one until the end of the project, when you choose to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.0crat.com/join&quot;&gt;work with us&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You will see below that our methods of software development &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/04/17/how-xdsd-is-different.html&quot;&gt;seriously differ&lt;/a&gt; from what many other teams are using. I personally pay a lot of attention to &lt;a href=&quot;/2017/04/11/flexibility-equates-lower-quality.html&quot;&gt;quality&lt;/a&gt; of code and quality of the internal processes that connect our team.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;!--more--&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are four phases in every project I work with in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zerocracy.com&quot;&gt;Zerocracy&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thinking&lt;/strong&gt;. Here we’re trying to understand: What is the problem that the product is going to solve? We’re also investigating the product’s boundaries—who will work with the software (actors) and how will they work with it (user stories). Deliverables: &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/11/10/ten-mistakes-in-specs.html&quot;&gt;specification&lt;/a&gt;. Duration: from 2 days up to 3 weeks. Participants: product owner, analyst(s), architect, &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/02/18/holacracy-autocracy.html&quot;&gt;project manager&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Building&lt;/strong&gt;. Here the software architect is creating a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_concept&quot;&gt;proof-of-concept&lt;/a&gt; (aka an &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product&quot;&gt;MVP&lt;/a&gt; or prototype or a skeleton). It is a one-man job that is done almost without any interaction with anyone else. The architect builds the product according to the specification in a very limited time frame. The result will have multiple &lt;a href=&quot;/2018/04/24/right-way-to-report-bugs.html&quot;&gt;bugs&lt;/a&gt; and open ends, but it will implement the main user story. The architect also configures &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/10/08/continuous-integration-is-dead.html&quot;&gt;continuous integration&lt;/a&gt; and delivery pipelines. Deliverables: working software. Duration: 2-5 days. Participants: architect.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fixing&lt;/strong&gt;. At this phase we are adding all the meat to the skeleton. This phase takes most of the time and budget and involves many participants. In some projects we invite up to 50 people to work, at the same time. Since we treat all inconsistencies as bugs, this phase is mostly about finding, reporting and fixing bugs, in order to stabilize the product and get it ready for market launch. We increment and release the software multiple times a day, preferably to its user champions. Deliverables: bug fixes via pull requests. Duration: from weeks to months. Participants: programmer(s), designer(s), tester(s), code reviewer(s), architect, project manager.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Using&lt;/strong&gt;. At this final phase we are launching the product to its end-users, and collecting their feedback (both positive and negative). Everything they are reporting back to us is being registered as a bug. Then, we categorize the bugs and fix them. This phase may take years, but it never involves active implementation of new features. Deliverables: bug fixes via pull requests. Duration: months. Participants: programmer(s), code reviewer(s), project manager.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;The biggest (i.e., longest and most expensive) phase is, of course, Fixing. It usually takes the majority of time (over 70%). However, the most important and risky phase is the first one—Thinking. A mistake made during Thinking will &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/06/02/how-to-estimate-software-cost.html&quot;&gt;cost&lt;/a&gt; much more than a mistake made later.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;thinking&quot;&gt;Thinking&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;badge&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.yegor256.com/images/2014/10/lifecycle-thinking.png&quot; style=&quot;width:250px;max-width:100%;&quot; alt=&quot;badge&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thinking is the first and the most important phase.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;First, we give a name to the project and create a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; repository. We try to keep all our projects (both &lt;a href=&quot;/2017/05/30/why-contribute-to-open-source.html&quot;&gt;open source&lt;/a&gt; and commercial) in GitHub. Mostly because the platform is very popular, very powerful, and really cheap (&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/pricing&quot;&gt;$7/mo&lt;/a&gt; for a set of 5 private projects). We also keep &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/08/23/communication-maturity.html&quot;&gt;all&lt;/a&gt; communication in the GitHub issue tracker.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Then, we create a simple half-page SRS document (Software Requirements Specification). Usually this is done right inside the source code, but sometimes in the GitHub &lt;code&gt;README.md&lt;/code&gt; file. What’s important is that the document should be under version control. We will modify it during the course of the project, very intensively. The &lt;code&gt;README.md&lt;/code&gt; should &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/10/20/how-we-write-product-vision.html&quot;&gt;briefly&lt;/a&gt; identify main “actors” of the system and define the product scope.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Even though it is only half a page, the creation of this initial SRS document is the most important and the most expensive task in the entire project. We pay a lot of attention to this step. Usually this document is written by one of our system analysts in direct communication with the project sponsor. We can’t afford a mistake at this step.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Then, we invite a few new system analysts to the project. These guys are responsible for turning our initial &lt;code&gt;README&lt;/code&gt; into a more complete and detailed &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/11/10/ten-mistakes-in-specs.html&quot;&gt;specification&lt;/a&gt;. They start by asking questions, submitting them one by one as GitHub issues. Every question is addressed to the product owner. Using his/her answers, system analysts modify the &lt;code&gt;README&lt;/code&gt; document. Sometimes we’re using &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/04/26/incremental-requirements-with-requs.html&quot;&gt;Requs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At the end of the Thinking phase we estimate the size of the project, in &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/11/14/hits-of-code.html&quot;&gt;Hits of Code&lt;/a&gt;. Using this HoC metric, we can roughly &lt;a href=&quot;http://at.teamed.io/calculator.html&quot;&gt;estimate a budget&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;building&quot;&gt;Building&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;badge&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.yegor256.com/images/2014/10/lifecycle-building.png&quot; style=&quot;width:250px;max-width:100%;&quot; alt=&quot;badge&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is a one-man job for &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/10/12/who-is-software-architect.html&quot;&gt;an architect&lt;/a&gt;.

Here we’re trying to understand: What is the problem that the product is going to solve? We’re also investigating the product’s boundaries—who will work with the software (actors) and how will they work with it (user stories). Deliverables: <a href="/2015/11/10/ten-mistakes-in-specs.html">specification</a>. Duration: from 2 days up to 3 weeks. Participants: product owner, analyst(s), architect, <a href="/2016/02/18/holacracy-autocracy.html">project manager</a>.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Building</strong>. Here the software architect is creating a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_concept">proof-of-concept</a> (aka an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product">MVP</a> or prototype or a skeleton). It is a one-man job that is done almost without any interaction with anyone else. The architect builds the product according to the specification in a very limited time frame. The result will have multiple <a href="/2018/04/24/right-way-to-report-bugs.html">bugs</a> and open ends, but it will implement the main user story. The architect also configures <a href="/2014/10/08/continuous-integration-is-dead.html">continuous integration</a> and delivery pipelines. Deliverables: working software. Duration: 2-5 days. Participants: architect.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Fixing</strong>. At this phase we are adding all the meat to the skeleton. This phase takes most of the time and budget and involves many participants. In some projects we invite up to 50 people to work, at the same time. Since we treat all inconsistencies as bugs, this phase is mostly about finding, reporting and fixing bugs, in order to stabilize the product and get it ready for market launch. We increment and release the software multiple times a day, preferably to its user champions. Deliverables: bug fixes via pull requests. Duration: from weeks to months. Participants: programmer(s), designer(s), tester(s), code reviewer(s), architect, project manager.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Using</strong>. At this final phase we are launching the product to its end-users, and collecting their feedback (both positive and negative). Everything they are reporting back to us is being registered as a bug. Then, we categorize the bugs and fix them. This phase may take years, but it never involves active implementation of new features. Deliverables: bug fixes via pull requests. Duration: months. Participants: programmer(s), code reviewer(s), project manager.</p></li></ul><p>The biggest (i.e., longest and most expensive) phase is, of course, Fixing. It usually takes the majority of time (over 70%). However, the most important and risky phase is the first one—Thinking. A mistake made during Thinking will <a href="/2015/06/02/how-to-estimate-software-cost.html">cost</a> much more than a mistake made later.</p><h2 id="thinking">Thinking</h2><figure class="badge"><img src="https://www.yegor256.com/images/2014/10/lifecycle-thinking.png" style="width:250px;max-width:100%;" alt="badge" /></figure><p>Thinking is the first and the most important phase.</p><p>First, we give a name to the project and create a <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a> repository. We try to keep all our projects (both <a href="/2017/05/30/why-contribute-to-open-source.html">open source</a> and commercial) in GitHub. Mostly because the platform is very popular, very powerful, and really cheap (<a href="https://github.com/pricing">$7/mo</a> for a set of 5 private projects). We also keep <a href="/2016/08/23/communication-maturity.html">all</a> communication in the GitHub issue tracker.</p><p>Then, we create a simple half-page SRS document (Software Requirements Specification). Usually this is done right inside the source code, but sometimes in the GitHub <code>README.md</code> file. What’s important is that the document should be under version control. We will modify it during the course of the project, very intensively. The <code>README.md</code> should <a href="/2014/10/20/how-we-write-product-vision.html">briefly</a> identify main “actors” of the system and define the product scope.</p><p>Even though it is only half a page, the creation of this initial SRS document is the most important and the most expensive task in the entire project. We pay a lot of attention to this step. Usually this document is written by one of our system analysts in direct communication with the project sponsor. We can’t afford a mistake at this step.</p><p>Then, we invite a few new system analysts to the project. These guys are responsible for turning our initial <code>README</code> into a more complete and detailed <a href="/2015/11/10/ten-mistakes-in-specs.html">specification</a>. They start by asking questions, submitting them one by one as GitHub issues. Every question is addressed to the product owner. Using his/her answers, system analysts modify the <code>README</code> document. Sometimes we’re using <a href="/2014/04/26/incremental-requirements-with-requs.html">Requs</a>.</p><p>At the end of the Thinking phase we estimate the size of the project, in <a href="/2014/11/14/hits-of-code.html">Hits of Code</a>. Using this HoC metric, we can roughly <a href="http://at.teamed.io/calculator.html">estimate a budget</a>.</p><h2 id="building">Building</h2><figure class="badge"><img src="https://www.yegor256.com/images/2014/10/lifecycle-building.png" style="width:250px;max-width:100%;" alt="badge" /></figure><p>This is a one-man job for <a href="/2014/10/12/who-is-software-architect.html">an architect</a>. Every project we work on has an architect who is <a href="/2015/05/11/software-architect-responsibilities.html">personally responsible</a> for the quality and technical decisions. We have a few brilliant engineers for this role.</p><p>The Building phase is rather straight forward. The architect has to implement the solution according to the <code>README</code>, in a few working days. No matter how big the idea and how massive the planning development, the architect still has to create (build from scratch!) the product in, say, three days.</p><p>Besides building the software itself, the architect has to configure all basic DevOps processes, including: 1) automated testing and quality control, 2) deploying and releasing pipelines, 3) repository of artifacts, 4) <a href="/2014/10/08/continuous-integration-is-dead.html">continuous integration</a> service, etc.</p><p>The result of this phase is a working software package, deployable to its destination and available for testers. Technical <a href="/2014/08/13/strict-code-quality-control.html">quality requirements</a> are also defined at this phase.</p><p>More about the Building phase here: <a href="/2015/08/04/nine-steps-start-software-project.html">Nine Steps to Start a Software Project</a></p><h2 id="fixing">Fixing</h2><figure class="badge"><img src="https://www.yegor256.com/images/2014/10/lifecycle-fixing.png" style="width:250px;max-width:100%;" alt="badge" /></figure><p>Now it’s time to build a distributed team of programmers. First, we invite those who’ve worked on other projects and have already have proven their quality. Very often we invite new people, finding them through <a href="/2017/02/14/stackoverflow-is-your-tool.html">StackOverflow</a>, GitHub, Upwork, and other sources. An average team size of an average project is 15-25 programmers.</p><p>At this phase, we understand <a href="/2014/11/24/principles-of-bug-tracking.html">any inconsistency</a> as a bug. If something is not clear in the documentation, or if something can be refactored for better readability, or if a function can be improved for higher performance—it is a bug to us. And <a href="/2014/04/13/bugs-are-welcome.html">bugs are welcome</a> in our projects. We encourage everybody to report as many bugs as possible. This is how we achieve high quality.</p><p>That is why the phase is called Fixing, after all. We are reporting bugs and <a href="/2014/04/12/puzzle-driven-development-by-roles.html">fixing</a> them. Hundreds of bugs. Sometimes thousands. The product grows in front of our very eyes, because after every bug fix we re-deploy the entire product to the production platform.</p><p>Every bug is reported, classified, discussed, and fixed in its own GitHub ticket and its own Git branch. We never allow anyone to just commit to the <code>master</code> branch—all changes must pass through our <a href="/2014/08/13/strict-code-quality-control.html">quality controls</a> and be merged into <code>master</code> by <a href="http://www.rultor.com">rultor.com</a>, our <a href="/2014/07/24/rultor-automated-merging.html">merging bot</a>.</p><p>Also important to mention is that all communications with the product owner and between programmers happen only through GitHub issues. We <a href="/2014/10/07/stop-chatting-start-coding.html">never use any chats</a>, Skype, emails or conferencing software. We communicate only through tickets and <a href="/2015/11/03/chatbot-better-than-ui-for-microservice.html">comments</a> in GitHub.</p><h2 id="using">Using</h2><figure class="badge"><img src="https://www.yegor256.com/images/2014/10/lifecycle-using.png" style="width:250px;max-width:100%;" alt="badge" /></figure><p>This is the final phase and it can take quite a long time. By now, the product is ready and is launched to the market. But we still receive <a href="/2018/04/24/right-way-to-report-bugs.html">bug reports</a> and feature request from the product owner, and we still fix them through the same process flow as in the Fixing phase.</p><p>We try to keep this phase as quiet as possible, in terms of the amount of bugs reported and fixed. Thanks to our intensive and pro-active bug finding and fixing in the previous phase, we usually have very few problems at the Using phase.</p><p>And big feature requests? At this phase, we usually try to convert them into new projects and develop them separately, starting again from Thinking.</p><p>BTW, the illustrations you see above are made by <a href="https://www.behance.net/lopesbarbara">Bárbara Lopes</a>.</p></p><nav class="buttons notranslate desktop-only"> <a href="http://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://www.yegor256.com/2014/10/06/software-project-lifecycle.html" title="Share on Facebook" class="button" rel="nofollow"> <span class="count count-facebook">0</span> <i class="icon icon-facebook notranslate" aria-hidden="true"></i> </a> <a href="https://twitter.com/share?url=https://www.yegor256.com/2014/10/06/software-project-lifecycle.html&amp;text=Project+Lifecycle+in+Zerocracy" title="Share on Twitter" class="button" rel="nofollow"> <span class="count count-twitter">0</span> <i class="icon icon-twitter notranslate" aria-hidden="true"></i> </a> <a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=https://www.yegor256.com/2014/10/06/software-project-lifecycle.html" title="Share on Google+" class="button" rel="nofollow"> <span class="count count-googleplus">0</span> <i class="icon icon-googleplus notranslate" aria-hidden="true"></i> </a> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/cws/share?url=https://www.yegor256.com/2014/10/06/software-project-lifecycle.html" title="Share on LinkedIn" class="button" rel="nofollow"> <span class="count count-linkedin">0</span> <i class="icon icon-linkedin notranslate" aria-hidden="true"></i> </a> <a href="http://reddit.com/submit?url=https://www.yegor256.com/2014/10/06/software-project-lifecycle.html%3F2014-40&amp;title=Project+Lifecycle+in+Zerocracy" title="Share on Reddit" class="button" rel="nofollow"> <span class="count count-reddit">0</span> <i class="icon icon-reddit notranslate" aria-hidden="true"></i> </a> <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/submitlink?u=https://www.yegor256.com/2014/10/06/software-project-lifecycle.html%3F2014-40&amp;t=Project+Lifecycle+in+Zerocracy" title="Share on Hacker News" class="button" rel="nofollow"> <span class="count count-hackernews">0</span> <i class="icon icon-hackernews notranslate" aria-hidden="true"></i> </a> </nav> </header> <article class="main" itemprop="articleBody"><div ><p>In addition to being a hands-on programmer, I’m also co-founder and CTO of <a href="https://www.zerocracy.com">Zerocracy</a>, a custom software development company.

Thanks to our intensive and pro-active bug finding and fixing in the previous phase, we usually have very few problems at the Using phase.</p><p>And big feature requests? At this phase, we usually try to convert them into new projects and develop them separately, starting again from Thinking.</p><p>BTW, the illustrations you see above are made by <a href="https://www.behance.net/lopesbarbara">Bárbara Lopes</a>.</p></div></article></div><div class="wrapper"> <related-posts /></div><div class="disqus" role="complementary"><p class="disqus_hint"> Please, use <a href="https://help.disqus.com/commenting/what-html-tags-are-allowed-within-comments">syntax highlighting</a> in your comments, to make them more readable.</p><div id="disqus_thread" class="disqus-thread"> <a>&nbsp;</a></div><script> var disqus_config = function () { this.page.url = document.location.href.split('?')[0].split('#')[0].replace('https://', 'http://'); this.page.identifier = this.page.url; }; (function() { var d = document, s = d.createElement('script'); s.src = '//yegor256.disqus.com/embed.js'; s.setAttribute('data-timestamp', +new Date()); (d.head || d.body).appendChild(s); })(); </script> <noscript><div><p class="red"> JavaScript is disabled in your browser, that's why you can't see comments under this post.</p></div></noscript></div><div class="wrapper"> <footer class="footer"><p> &copy; <span itemscope="" itemprop="copyrightHolder" itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"> <span itemprop="name">Yegor Bugayenko</span> </span> 2014&ndash;<span itemprop="copyrightYear">2018</span></p></footer></div></section><div class="wrapper unprintable" style="text-align:center;margin-top:2em;"> <a href="http://www.sixnines.io/h/3ba1652f"> <img src="//www.sixnines.io/b/3ba1652f?style=flat" alt="sixnines availability badge"/> </a></div><script src="//code.jquery.com/jquery-1.9.0.min.js"></script> <script src="/js/all.js?c998b88f617"></script> <script>var disqus_shortname = 'yegor256';</script> <script id="dsq-count-scr" src="//yegor256.disqus.com/count.js" async="async"></script> <script> (function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){ (i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o), m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m) })(window,document,'script','//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga'); ga('create', 'UA-1963507-32', 'auto'); ga('send', 'pageview'); </script> <script> Cd=document;Cr="&"+Math.random();Cp="&s=1"; Cd.cookie="b=b";if(Cd.cookie)Cp+="&c=1"; Cp+="&t="+(new Date()).getTimezoneOffset(); if(self!=top)Cp+="&f=1"; </script> <script> if(navigator.javaEnabled())Cp+="&j=1"; </script> <script> if(typeof(screen)!='undefined')Cp+="&w="+screen.width+"&h="+ screen.height+"&d="+(screen.colorDepth?screen.colorDepth:screen.pixelDepth); </script> <script> Cd.write("<img src='//c.hit.ua/hit?i=95870&g=0&x=2"+Cp+Cr+ "&r="+escape(Cd.referrer)+"&u="+escape(window.location.href)+ "' border='0' wi"+"dth='1' he"+"ight='1'/>"); </script> <script type="application/ld+json"> { "@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Person", "name": "Yegor Bugayenko", "url": "https://www.yegor256.com", "sameAs": [ "https://www.facebook.com/yegor256", "https://instagram.com/yegor256", "https://www.linkedin.com/in/yegor256", "https://twitter.com/yegor256", "https://github.com/yegor256", "https://www.pinterest.com/yegor256/" ] } </script> </body> </html> <!DOCTYPE html> <html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/WebSite"> <head> <meta charset="utf-8"/> <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Monetary rewards for employees. Do they work? Should we use them? Can money motivate creative minds? Will a programmer work better if he gets paid only when he reaches his goals and objectives?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Much research has already been done on this subject, and most of it proves that connecting results with money is a very demotivating approach. For example, Ian Larkin &lt;a href=&quot;http://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/7215.html&quot;&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; that the most productive workers “suffered a 6-8% decrease in productivity after the award was instituted.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I believe this is completely true. Money may become a terrible de-motivator for all modern employees (not just programmers).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;My question is—why is this so?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;!--more--&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Why doesn't money work, even when it was invented to be a universal instrument to measure our labor?&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;Why doesn’t money work, even when it was invented to be a universal instrument to measure our labor? Why can’t an American dollar, which has been used for centuries as a trading tool between working people, be used anymore?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;youtube&quot;&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6NwcQyEY18&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;box&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://i.ytimg.com/vi/F6NwcQyEY18/mqdefault.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;YouTube video #F6NwcQyEY18&quot; /&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;play&quot;&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;icon icon-play&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;div&gt;How Monetary Awards Can Work?; 13 April 2015.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;Why, in a &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/10/06/how-to-be-good-office-slave.html&quot;&gt;modern office&lt;/a&gt;, do we try to hide &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/01/12/good-programmers-dont-work-for-equity.html&quot;&gt;monetary&lt;/a&gt; motivation and replace it with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hrworld.com/features/25-employee-rewards/&quot;&gt;everything else&lt;/a&gt;, like free lunches, team building events, paid vacations, etc. Why don’t we just say—“Jeff completed his task faster than everybody else. This is his $500 check. Whoever completes the next task gets $300,” out loud in the office?… Sounds uncomfortable, doesn’t it?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Why does money as a motivator scare us?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I have an answer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Money doesn’t work when there are no ground rules.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When we say that Jeff will get a $500 bonus if he finishes his task on time, but don’t say what he should do when someone distracts him—Jeff gets frustrated. He also doesn’t understand who his boss is anymore. Does he just work for the bonus, or should he also satisfy a CTO who comes to his desk asking him to do something else urgently? Is Jeff allowed to tell the CTO “to get lost” because he’s working towards his own personal objective (the bonus)?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In all cases I’ve seen myself and in all research cases I’ve read about, people keep repeating the same mistake. They create a rewards program (monetary or not) without setting ground rules for the team. By doing so, they encourage people to play wild-wild west, where the fastest gets the cash bag. Obviously, the Bad and the Ugly get to the prize faster, while the Good gets demotivated and depressed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;unprintable&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.yegor256.com/images/2014/09/rules-with-and-without-rewards.png&quot; itemprop=&quot;image&quot; style=&quot;width:600px;max-width:100%;&quot; alt=&quot;The figure&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p class=&quot;note&quot;&gt; In a clockwise direction from the top left corner: The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966) by Sergio Leone; Roger Federer; A Serious Man (2009) by Ethan Coen and Joel Coen; Two and a Half Men (TV Series). &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What do I mean by ground rules?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It should be a simple document (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pmi.org/PMBOK-Guide-and-Standards.aspx&quot;&gt;PMBOK&lt;/a&gt; calls it a Staffing Management Plan) that helps me, as a team member, answer at least these basic questions:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;How my personal results are measured?&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Who gives me tasks and who do I report to?&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;How should I resolve &lt;a href=&quot;/2017/01/03/how-much-you-love-conflicts.html&quot;&gt;conflicts&lt;/a&gt; between tasks?&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;What are my personal deadlines for every task?&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Do I have measurable quality expectations for my deliverables?&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;How do my mistakes affect my performance grade?&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/10/13/competition-without-rules.html&quot;&gt;ground rules&lt;/a&gt; document should be superior to your boss. If the document says that your results get an A+ grade, the boss should have &lt;strong&gt;no say&lt;/strong&gt;. If she doesn’t like you personally, it doesn’t matter. You get an A+ grade, and you are the best. That’s it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Does your team have such a document? Can you answer all of these questions? If not, you’re not ready for a rewards program. It will only make your management situation worse, just like all the scientific research says. Rewards will motivate the most cunning to take advantage of the most hard working and good-natured. Team spirit will suffer, big time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Fair competition leads to a better cumulative result&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;On the other hand, if you have that “&lt;a href=&quot;/2015/10/13/competition-without-rules.html&quot;&gt;ground rules&lt;/a&gt;” document and you strictly follow it, giving monetary rewards to your workers will significantly increase their performance and motivation. They will know exactly what needs to be done to get the rewards, and they won’t have any distraction. Your team won’t be a group of wild west gunslingers anymore, but more like players in a sports arena. The best players will go further, and the worst will know exactly what needs to be done to improve. Fair competition will lead to a better cumulative result.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Moreover, if your ground rules are strict and explicit, you can use not only rewards, but also &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/01/05/how-to-punish-employees.html&quot;&gt;punishments&lt;/a&gt;. And your team will &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/09/16/how-to-fire-someone-right.html&quot;&gt;gladly&lt;/a&gt; accept them, because they will help emphasize what (and who) works best and help get rid of the waste.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I’m speaking from experience here. In &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.xdsd.org&quot;&gt;XDSD&lt;/a&gt; we’re not only rewarding programmers with money, but we also never pay for anything except delivered results. We manage to do this mostly because our ground rules are very strict and non-ambiguous.

result-oriented (27:40)?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Are there any other challenges (29:12)?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;What do I like personally about it

&lt;p&gt;eXtremely Distributed Software Development, or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.xdsd.org&quot;&gt;XDSD&lt;/a&gt; for short, is a methodology that differs significantly from working in traditional software development teams. Most &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.xdsd.org&quot;&gt;XDSD&lt;/a&gt; methods are so different (yet critical) that many newcomers get confused. This article should help you bootstrap once you join a project managed with by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.xdsd.org&quot;&gt;XDSD&lt;/a&gt; principles—either as a developer or a project sponsor.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;!--more--&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;jb_picture&quot;&gt;&lt;img itemprop=&quot;image&quot; alt=&quot;Revolver (2005) by Guy Ritchie&quot; src=&quot;/images/2014/04/revolver-avi-with-dollar.png&quot; longdesc=&quot;#7387fa1a&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption id=&quot;7387fa1a&quot;&gt;Revolver (2005) by Guy Ritchie&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;we-pay-only-for-closed-tasks&quot;&gt;We Pay Only For Closed Tasks&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Unlike with many other projects, in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.xdsd.org&quot;&gt;XDSD&lt;/a&gt;, we pay only for closed tasks and the agreed upon time budget. Let me explain by example. Let’s say, you are a Ruby programmer and you a get a new task that requires you to fix a broken unit test. The task has a time budget of 30 minutes, as is the case most of the time. Sometimes, though, tasks may have time budgets of fifteen minutes or one hour.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;youtube&quot;&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EytYc7K5JA&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;box&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7EytYc7K5JA/mqdefault.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;YouTube video #7EytYc7K5JA&quot; /&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;play&quot;&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;icon icon-play&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;div&gt;eXtremely Distributed Software Development, at DevTernity; 21 December 2016.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;In our example, we agree upon a contract rate of $50 per hour. With the broken test, you will receive $25 for completing the task—30 minute tasked billed at $50 per hour.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It does not matter how long it actually takes you to fix the test. Your actual time spent on the project may be five minutes or five hours. Nevertheless, you will receive compensation for 30 minutes of work only. If you fix the broken test in 5 minutes, you receive $25. If the task takes you an hour, or even a month, to complete, you still receive only $25.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Furthermore, if you fail to fix the unit test and close the task altogether, you will receive no pay at all for the assignment.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You can view more details about this principle in the following articles: &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/04/13/no-obligations-principle.html&quot;&gt;No Obligations Principle&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/04/15/definition-of-done.html&quot;&gt;Definition of Done&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As mentioned above, this is one of the most important differences between XDSD and other methods. Many people get confused when they see this principle in action, and some leave our projects because of it. They simply are used to being paid by the end of the month—no matter how much work they actually deliver. In XDSD, we consider this type of approach very unfair. We feel that people who deliver more results should receive more cash. Conversely, those who don’t deliver should get less.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;we-deliver-unfinished-components&quot;&gt;We Deliver Unfinished Components&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Since most of our tasks are half an hour in size, we encourage developers to deliver unfinished components.

To clarify, we never use emails, we never chat on Skype and we don’t do any meetings or phone calls. Additionally, XDSD maintains no type mailing list. Our only method of communication is a ticket tracking system (which in most projects consists of &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/04/15/github-guidelines.html&quot;&gt;GitHub Issues&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;youtube&quot;&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRZYJGYdrwk&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;box&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qRZYJGYdrwk/mqdefault.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;YouTube video #qRZYJGYdrwk&quot; /&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;play&quot;&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;icon icon-play&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;div&gt;XDSD: management without meetings; 13 February 2016.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;Moreover, we discourage horizontal communications between developers regarding the scope of individual tasks. When assigned a task, your single and only point of contact (and your only customer) is the task author. You communicate with the author in the ticket to clarify task requirements.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When the &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/11/10/ten-mistakes-in-specs.html&quot;&gt;requirements&lt;/a&gt; of a task are clear—and you understand them fully—deliver the result to the author and wait for him to close the task. After the author closes the task, the &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/02/18/holacracy-autocracy.html&quot;&gt;project manager&lt;/a&gt; pays you.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;picture&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.yegor256.com/images/2014/04/goodfellas-paulie-talking.png&quot; style=&quot;width:600px;max-width:100%;&quot; alt=&quot;Goodfellas (1990) by Martin Scorsese&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Goodfellas (1990) by Martin Scorsese&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;We’re very strict about this principle—no informal communications. However, it doesn’t mean that we are not interested in your opinions and constructive criticism. Rather, we encourage everyone to submit their suggestions and bugs. By the way, we pay for &lt;a href=&quot;/2018/04/24/right-way-to-report-bugs.html&quot;&gt;bugs&lt;/a&gt; (see the next section for further details about bug reporting and payments.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Since we have no formal communications, members of project teams are not required to work at specific times. Instead, team members work at times convenient for them in their time zones. This includes weekdays and weekends.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;we-pay-for-bugs&quot;&gt;We Pay For Bugs&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Unlike many other software teams, XDSD welcomes &lt;a href=&quot;/2018/04/24/right-way-to-report-bugs.html&quot;&gt;bug reports&lt;/a&gt; in all our projects. Therefore, we ask for bugs openly and expect team members to report them. Review the following article for complete details on XDSD bug reporting: &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/04/13/bugs-are-welcome.html&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bugs Are Welcome&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We expect everyone involved with a project to report every bug found. Additionally, we encourage team members to make suggestions. In XDSD, we pay team members for every properly reported bug.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;youtube&quot;&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCr9dtGdi2c&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;box&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tCr9dtGdi2c/mqdefault.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;YouTube video #tCr9dtGdi2c&quot; /&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;play&quot;&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;icon icon-play&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;div&gt;XDSD: How Extreme is Your Team; 13 November 2016.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;XDSD makes payments for reported bugs because we believe that the more of them we can find, the higher the &lt;a href=&quot;/2017/04/11/flexibility-equates-lower-quality.html&quot;&gt;quality&lt;/a&gt; of the end product. Some new developers are surprised when they receive tasks such as “you must find 10 bugs in class A.” Often, the natural reaction is to ask “what if there are no bugs?” However, &lt;a href=&quot;/2017/05/23/unlimited-number-of-bugs.html&quot;&gt;we believe&lt;/a&gt; that any software product may have an unlimited amount of bugs; it is just a matter of expending the time and effort needed to discover them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;only-pull-request&quot;&gt;Only Pull Request&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;We never grant team member access to the &lt;code&gt;master&lt;/code&gt; branch—no matter how long you work on a project. Consequently, you must always submit your changes through pull requests (most of our projects are done in &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/04/15/github-guidelines.html&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We enforce this policy not because we don’t trust our developers, but simply because we don’t trust anyone :) Read this article: &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/07/21/read-only-master-branch.html&quot;&gt;Master Branch Must Be Read-Only&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;no-compromises-about-code-quality&quot;&gt;No Compromises About Code Quality&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Before merge any changes to the &lt;code&gt;master&lt;/code&gt; branch, we check the entire code base with unit tests and &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/08/13/strict-code-quality-control.html&quot;&gt;static analyzers&lt;/a&gt;. Unit testing is a very common component in modern software development, and one by which you should not be surprised. However, the strictness of static analysis is something that often frustrates XDSD newcomers, and we understand that. We pay much more attention to the quality and uniformity of our source code than most of our competing software development teams.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Even more important is that we never make compromises. If your pull request violates even one rule of the static analyzer, it won’t be accepted. And, it doesn’t matter how small or innocent that violation may look. This merging process is &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/07/24/rultor-automated-merging.html&quot;&gt;fully automated&lt;/a&gt; and can’t be bypassed.&lt;/p&gt; " /> <meta name="keywords" content="next, path, output, content, previous, url, relative_path, id, collection, excerpt, draft, categories, layout, title, date, tags, description, keywords, image, jb_picture, slug, ext" /> <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1"/> <meta name="google-site-verification" content="JEj_gQr2CPe2QKGw8XdMz0R7VboQIUbX3FlM-lwTq-8" /> <meta name="author" content="Yegor Bugayenko"> <meta name="article:published_time" content="2014-04-17 00:00:00 +0000"> <meta name="og:site_name" content="Yegor Bugayenko"/> <meta name="og:type" content="article" /> <meta name="og:locale" content="en_US" /> <meta name="twitter:account_id" content="4503599630178231" /> <meta name="twitter:creator" content="@yegor256"/> <meta name="twitter:site" content="@yegor256"/> <meta name="twitter:title" property="og:title" content="How XDSD Is Different"/> <meta name="twitter:description" property="og:description" content="&lt;figure class=&quot;badge&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.xdsd.org&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.xdsd.org/images/logo.svg&quot; style=&quot;width:100px;max-width:100%;&quot; alt=&quot;badge&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;eXtremely Distributed Software Development, or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.xdsd.org&quot;&gt;XDSD&lt;/a&gt; for short, is a methodology that differs significantly from working in traditional software development teams. Most &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.xdsd.org&quot;&gt;XDSD&lt;/a&gt; methods are so different (yet critical) that many newcomers get confused. This article should help you bootstrap once you join a project managed with by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.xdsd.org&quot;&gt;XDSD&lt;/a&gt; principles—either as a developer or a project sponsor.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;!--more--&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;jb_picture&quot;&gt;&lt;img itemprop=&quot;image&quot; alt=&quot;Revolver (2005) by Guy Ritchie&quot; src=&quot;/images/2014/04/revolver-avi-with-dollar.png&quot; longdesc=&quot;#7387fa1a&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption id=&quot;7387fa1a&quot;&gt;Revolver (2005) by Guy Ritchie&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;we-pay-only-for-closed-tasks&quot;&gt;We Pay Only For Closed Tasks&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Unlike with many other projects, in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.xdsd.org&quot;&gt;XDSD&lt;/a&gt;, we pay only for closed tasks and the agreed upon time budget. Let me explain by example. Let’s say, you are a Ruby programmer and you a get a new task that requires you to fix a broken unit test. The task has a time budget of 30 minutes, as is the case most of the time. Sometimes, though, tasks may have time budgets of fifteen minutes or one hour.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;youtube&quot;&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EytYc7K5JA&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;box&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7EytYc7K5JA/mqdefault.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;YouTube video #7EytYc7K5JA&quot; /&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;play&quot;&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;icon icon-play&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;div&gt;eXtremely Distributed Software Development, at DevTernity; 21 December 2016.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;In our example, we agree upon a contract rate of $50 per hour. With the broken test, you will receive $25 for completing the task—30 minute tasked billed at $50 per hour.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It does not matter how long it actually takes you to fix the test. Your actual time spent on the project may be five minutes or five hours. Nevertheless, you will receive compensation for 30 minutes of work only. If you fix the broken test in 5 minutes, you receive $25. If the task takes you an hour, or even a month, to complete, you still receive only $25.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Furthermore, if you fail to fix the unit test and close the task altogether, you will receive no pay at all for the assignment.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You can view more details about this principle in the following articles: &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/04/13/no-obligations-principle.html&quot;&gt;No Obligations Principle&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/04/15/definition-of-done.html&quot;&gt;Definition of Done&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As mentioned above, this is one of the most important differences between XDSD and other methods.

href="https://www.xdsd.org">XDSD</a> for short, is a methodology that differs significantly from working in traditional software development teams. Most <a href="https://www.xdsd.org">XDSD</a> methods are so different (yet critical) that many newcomers get confused. This article should help you bootstrap once you join a project managed with by <a href="https://www.xdsd.org">XDSD</a> principles—either as a developer or a project sponsor.</p><figure class="jb_picture"><img itemprop="image" alt="Revolver (2005) by Guy Ritchie" src="/images/2014/04/revolver-avi-with-dollar.png" longdesc="#7387fa1a" /><figcaption id="7387fa1a">Revolver (2005) by Guy Ritchie</figcaption></figure><h2 id="we-pay-only-for-closed-tasks">We Pay Only For Closed Tasks</h2><p>Unlike with many other projects, in <a href="https://www.xdsd.org">XDSD</a>, we pay only for closed tasks and the agreed upon time budget. Let me explain by example. Let’s say, you are a Ruby programmer and you a get a new task that requires you to fix a broken unit test. The task has a time budget of 30 minutes, as is the case most of the time. Sometimes, though, tasks may have time budgets of fifteen minutes or one hour.</p><aside class="youtube"> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EytYc7K5JA"><div class="box"> <img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7EytYc7K5JA/mqdefault.jpg" alt="YouTube video #7EytYc7K5JA" /><div class="play"><i class="icon icon-play"></i></div></div></a><div>eXtremely Distributed Software Development, at DevTernity; 21 December 2016.</div></aside><p>In our example, we agree upon a contract rate of $50 per hour. With the broken test, you will receive $25 for completing the task—30 minute tasked billed at $50 per hour.</p><p>It does not matter how long it actually takes you to fix the test. Your actual time spent on the project may be five minutes or five hours. Nevertheless, you will receive compensation for 30 minutes of work only. If you fix the broken test in 5 minutes, you receive $25. If the task takes you an hour, or even a month, to complete, you still receive only $25.</p><p>Furthermore, if you fail to fix the unit test and close the task altogether, you will receive no pay at all for the assignment.</p><p>You can view more details about this principle in the following articles: <a href="/2014/04/13/no-obligations-principle.html">No Obligations Principle</a> or <a href="/2014/04/15/definition-of-done.html">Definition of Done</a>.</p><p>As mentioned above, this is one of the most important differences between XDSD and other methods. Many people get confused when they see this principle in action, and some leave our projects because of it. They simply are used to being paid by the end of the month—no matter how much work they actually deliver. In XDSD, we consider this type of approach very unfair. We feel that people who deliver more results should receive more cash. Conversely, those who don’t deliver should get less.</p><h2 id="we-deliver-unfinished-components">We Deliver Unfinished Components</h2><p>Since most of our tasks are half an hour in size, we encourage developers to deliver unfinished components.

To clarify, we never use emails, we never chat on Skype and we don’t do any meetings or phone calls. Additionally, XDSD maintains no type mailing list. Our only method of communication is a ticket tracking system (which in most projects consists of <a href="/2014/04/15/github-guidelines.html">GitHub Issues</a>.)</p><aside class="youtube"> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRZYJGYdrwk"><div class="box"> <img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qRZYJGYdrwk/mqdefault.jpg" alt="YouTube video #qRZYJGYdrwk" /><div class="play"><i class="icon icon-play"></i></div></div></a><div>XDSD: management without meetings; 13 February 2016.</div></aside><p>Moreover, we discourage horizontal communications between developers regarding the scope of individual tasks. When assigned a task, your single and only point of contact (and your only customer) is the task author. You communicate with the author in the ticket to clarify task requirements.</p><p>When the <a href="/2015/11/10/ten-mistakes-in-specs.html">requirements</a> of a task are clear—and you understand them fully—deliver the result to the author and wait for him to close the task.

By the way, we pay for <a href="/2018/04/24/right-way-to-report-bugs.html">bugs</a> (see the next section for further details about bug reporting and payments.)</p><p>Since we have no formal communications, members of project teams are not required to work at specific times. Instead, team members work at times convenient for them in their time zones. This includes weekdays and weekends.</p><h2 id="we-pay-for-bugs">We Pay For Bugs</h2><p>Unlike many other software teams, XDSD welcomes <a href="/2018/04/24/right-way-to-report-bugs.html">bug reports</a> in all our projects. Therefore, we ask for bugs openly and expect team members to report them. Review the following article for complete details on XDSD bug reporting: <a href="/2014/04/13/bugs-are-welcome.html"><em>Bugs Are Welcome</em></a>.</p><p>We expect everyone involved with a project to report every bug found.

Some new developers are surprised when they receive tasks such as “you must find 10 bugs in class A.” Often, the natural reaction is to ask “what if there are no bugs?” However, <a href="/2017/05/23/unlimited-number-of-bugs.html">we believe</a> that any software product may have an unlimited amount of bugs; it is just a matter of expending the time and effort needed to discover them.</p><h2 id="only-pull-request">Only Pull Request</h2><p>We never grant team member access to the <code>master</code> branch—no matter how long you work on a project. Consequently, you must always submit your changes through pull requests (most of our projects are done in <a href="/2014/04/15/github-guidelines.html">GitHub</a>.)</p><p>We enforce this policy not because we don’t trust our developers, but simply because we don’t trust anyone :) Read this article: <a href="/2014/07/21/read-only-master-branch.html">Master Branch Must Be Read-Only</a>.</p><h2 id="no-compromises-about-code-quality">No Compromises About Code Quality</h2><p>Before merge any changes to the <code>master</code> branch, we check the entire code base with unit tests and <a href="/2014/08/13/strict-code-quality-control.html">static analyzers</a>. Unit testing is a very common component in modern software development, and one by which you should not be surprised. However, the strictness of static analysis is something that often frustrates XDSD newcomers, and we understand that. We pay much more attention to the quality and uniformity of our source code than most of our competing software development teams.</p><p>Even more important is that we never make compromises. If your pull request violates even one rule of the static analyzer, it won’t be accepted. And, it doesn’t matter how small or innocent that violation may look. This merging process is <a href="/2014/07/24/rultor-automated-merging.html">fully automated</a> and can’t be bypassed.</p></p><nav class="buttons notranslate desktop-only"> <a href="http://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://www.yegor256.com/2014/04/17/how-xdsd-is-different.html" title="Share on Facebook" class="button" rel="nofollow"> <span class="count count-facebook">0</span> <i class="icon icon-facebook notranslate" aria-hidden="true"></i> </a> <a href="https://twitter.com/share?url=https://www.yegor256.com/2014/04/17/how-xdsd-is-different.html&amp;text=How+XDSD+Is+Different" title="Share on Twitter" class="button" rel="nofollow"> <span class="count count-twitter">0</span> <i class="icon icon-twitter notranslate" aria-hidden="true"></i> </a> <a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=https://www.yegor256.com/2014/04/17/how-xdsd-is-different.html" title="Share on Google+" class="button" rel="nofollow"> <span class="count count-googleplus">0</span> <i class="icon icon-googleplus notranslate" aria-hidden="true"></i> </a> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/cws/share?url=https://www.yegor256.com/2014/04/17/how-xdsd-is-different.html" title="Share on LinkedIn" class="button" rel="nofollow"> <span class="count count-linkedin">0</span> <i class="icon icon-linkedin notranslate" aria-hidden="true"></i> </a> <a href="http://reddit.com/submit?url=https://www.yegor256.com/2014/04/17/how-xdsd-is-different.html%3F2014-15&amp;title=How+XDSD+Is+Different" title="Share on Reddit" class="button" rel="nofollow"> <span class="count count-reddit">0</span> <i class="icon icon-reddit notranslate" aria-hidden="true"></i> </a> <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/submitlink?u=https://www.yegor256.com/2014/04/17/how-xdsd-is-different.html%3F2014-15&amp;t=How+XDSD+Is+Different" title="Share on Hacker News" class="button" rel="nofollow"> <span class="count count-hackernews">0</span> <i class="icon icon-hackernews notranslate" aria-hidden="true"></i> </a> </nav> </header> <article class="main" itemprop="articleBody"><div > <figure class="badge"><a href="https://www.xdsd.org"><img src="https://www.xdsd.org/images/logo.svg" style="width:100px;max-width:100%;" alt="badge" /></a></figure><p>eXtremely Distributed Software Development, or <a href="https://www.xdsd.org">XDSD</a> for short, is a methodology that differs significantly from working in traditional software development teams.

Its authors present problems as monkeys sitting on our shoulders. When the &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/02/18/holacracy-autocracy.html&quot;&gt;project manager&lt;/a&gt; assigns a task to a programmer—he moves the monkey from his shoulders to the programmer’s shoulders.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;youtube&quot;&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRZYJGYdrwk&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;box&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qRZYJGYdrwk/mqdefault.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;YouTube video #qRZYJGYdrwk&quot; /&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;play&quot;&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;icon icon-play&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;div&gt;XDSD: management without meetings; 13 February 2016.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;The programmer usually presents the excuse “I don’t know what to do.” Now the monkey is back on the shoulders of the managers. The goal of the manager is to send the monkey back to make it the programmer’s problem again.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One of traditional way of transferring responsibility back to team members is to become an aggressive manager. For instance the &lt;a href=&quot;/2017/08/01/how-to-manage-a-manager.html&quot;&gt;manager&lt;/a&gt; may say, “You have a birthday tomorrow? I don’t care, you still have to meet your deadline” or “You don’t know how to fix the unit test? Not my problem, it should be fixed by tomorrow,” etc.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We’ve all seen multiple examples of that type of aggressive management. Personally, I find this management style extremely annoying and destructive for the project. The project environment becomes very unhealthy and good people usually end up leaving.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;To keep the project on track and meet all milestones, responsibility must be on the shoulders of the team members.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;Another traditional management method is &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/09/22/micromanagement.html&quot;&gt;micro-management&lt;/a&gt;. This results when the &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/05/24/who-is-project-manager.html&quot;&gt;project manager&lt;/a&gt; checks task statuses every few hours and tells people what to do and how to handle problems. Needless to say, this management style ruins the team and causes good people to leave even faster.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, in order to keep the project on track and meet all milestones, responsibility &lt;strong&gt;must be&lt;/strong&gt; on the shoulders of the team members. They should be responsible for their own tasks and report back to the project manager when they are finished with their jobs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;jb_picture&quot;&gt;&lt;img itemprop=&quot;image&quot; alt=&quot;The Big Lebowski (1998) by Joel Coen&quot; src=&quot;/images/2014/04/big-lebowski-her-life-is-in-your-hands.png&quot; longdesc=&quot;#64238ed6&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption id=&quot;64238ed6&quot;&gt;The Big Lebowski (1998) by Joel Coen&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Implementation problems should be solved by team members on their own. So, how do we accomplish this in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.xdsd.org&quot;&gt;XDSD&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;i-owe-you-nothing&quot;&gt;I Owe You Nothing&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.xdsd.org&quot;&gt;XDSD&lt;/a&gt;, there is the first fundamental principle that says everybody should be paid for deliverables. Based on this idea, we can go even further and declare a “No Obligations” principle.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In essence, for every team member, it says: if you don’t like the task assigned to you, don’t have time or you’re simply not in the mood—don’t do it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You have no obligation to do anything. You’re free to reject every second task that a project manager gives to you or even all of them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On the other hand, though, the project manager is not obliged to keep a task assigned to you for longer than 10 days (we think that this time frame is logical).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you get a task, and don’t deliver within ten days, the project manager can take it away and pay you nothing—no matter how much time you invested in the task already or the reasons for your failure to complete it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;where-are-the-monkeys-now&quot;&gt;Where Are The Monkeys Now?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;This principle helps us to separate responsibilities between project manager and team members. The manager is responsible for finding the right people and assigning them appropriate tasks. There is a problem with the project manager’s management style if he receives too many rejections from the team.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On the other hand, his team members are responsible for their tasks and should not provide excuses for non-completion. Well, team members can make excuses, but they won’t change anything. No matter what their excuses are, the deliverables will be purchased only from members who manage to complete their tasks on time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;how-does-this-affect-me&quot;&gt;How Does This Affect Me?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;When you’re working with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.xdsd.org&quot;&gt;XDSD&lt;/a&gt;-inspired project, you should always keep the “No Obligations” principle in mind. You should start a task only if you’re sure that you can finish it in a few days. You should pursue your tasks and control deadlines yourself. The project manager will not ask you for status updates, as usually happens with traditional projects. He will just take the task away from you after ten days if you don’t finish it. To avoid that, you should control your tasks and their deadlines.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With every task, try to be as &lt;a href=&quot;/2018/04/17/how-to-be-lazy.html&quot;&gt;lazy&lt;/a&gt; as possible and cut every corner you can. The smaller the amount of work you perform on a task, the easier it will be to deliver it and pass all quality controls.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Always remember that your efforts are not appreciated—only the deliverables matter.&lt;/p&gt; " /> <meta name="keywords" content="next, path, output, content, previous, url, relative_path, id, collection, excerpt, draft, categories, layout, title, date, tags, description, keywords, image, jb_picture, slug, ext" /> <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1"/> <meta name="google-site-verification" content="JEj_gQr2CPe2QKGw8XdMz0R7VboQIUbX3FlM-lwTq-8" /> <meta name="author" content="Yegor Bugayenko"> <meta name="article:published_time" content="2014-04-13 00:00:00 +0000"> <meta name="og:site_name" content="Yegor Bugayenko"/> <meta name="og:type" content="article" /> <meta name="og:locale" content="en_US" /> <meta name="twitter:account_id" content="4503599630178231" /> <meta name="twitter:creator" content="@yegor256"/> <meta name="twitter:site" content="@yegor256"/> <meta name="twitter:title" property="og:title" content="No Obligations"/> <meta name="twitter:description" property="og:description" content="&lt;figure class=&quot;badge&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.xdsd.org&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.xdsd.org/images/logo.svg&quot; style=&quot;width:100px;max-width:100%;&quot; alt=&quot;badge&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is a very common problem in project management—how to make team members more responsible and avoid &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micromanagement&quot;&gt;micro management&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We start with creating plans, drawing Gantt charts, announcing milestones, motivating everybody and promising big bonuses on success.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;!--more--&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;excuses&quot;&gt;Excuses&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Then everybody begins working and we start hearing excuses:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;“The task is not yet ready.

We want our projects to be “bug-free.” Our customers are asking us to develop software that doesn’t have bugs. And, we, as users, expect software to work without bugs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;jb_picture&quot;&gt;&lt;img itemprop=&quot;image&quot; alt=&quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (2005) by Tim Burton&quot; src=&quot;/images/2014/04/charlie-and-chocolate-factory-chewing-breakfast.png&quot; longdesc=&quot;#75a0d776&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption id=&quot;75a0d776&quot;&gt;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (2005) by Tim Burton&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;But, let’s take a look at bugs from a different angle. In &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.xdsd.org&quot;&gt;XDSD&lt;/a&gt;, we say that “bugs are welcome.” This means we encourage all interested parties to find bugs and report them. We want our team to see bugs as something that we need in our projects.

The more bugs that become visible, the more of them we can fix. More fixed bugs means fewer to annoy our users.

In <a href="https://www.xdsd.org">XDSD</a>, we say that “bugs are welcome.” This means we encourage all interested parties to find bugs and report them.

The more bugs that become visible, the more of them we can fix. More fixed bugs means fewer to annoy our users. By discovering bugs we make them visible.</p><p>This is the primary job of a software tester—to make bugs visible.</p><aside class="youtube"> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DYr8GYzJ6Q"><div class="box"> <img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7DYr8GYzJ6Q/mqdefault.jpg" alt="YouTube video #7DYr8GYzJ6Q" /><div class="play"><i class="icon icon-play"></i></div></div></a><div>The Philosophy of Bugs (webinar #17); 3 August 2016.</div></aside><p>Obviously, their visibility affects the <a href="/2017/12/26/software-quality-formula.html">quality of the product</a> in a positive way.

Therefore, we’re making it one of the project goals: “discover 500 bugs.”</p><p>Of course, our estimate may be wrong. Nevertheless, we have historical records for a few dozen projects, and in all of them the number is close to 500.

As I do this, I will attempt to convey typical points of view of various project members.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Basically, there are a few key &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/07/10/software-project-roles.html&quot;&gt;roles&lt;/a&gt; in any software team:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Project Manager—assigns tasks and pays on completion&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;System Analyst—documents the product owner’s ideas&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Architect—defines how system components interact&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Designer—implements most complex components&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Programmer—implements all components&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Tester—finds and reports bugs&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Everybody, except the &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/05/24/who-is-project-manager.html&quot;&gt;project manager&lt;/a&gt;, affects the project in two ways: they fix it and they break it at the same time. Let me explain this with a simple example.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;!--more--&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;fix-and-break&quot;&gt;Fix and Break&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Let’s assume, for the sake of simplicity, that a project is a simple software tool written by me for a close friend. I created the first draft version 0.0.1 and delivered it to him. For me, the project is done. I’ve completed the work, and hopefully will never have to return to it again.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;youtube&quot;&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsYGC2aUwfQ&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;box&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nsYGC2aUwfQ/mqdefault.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;YouTube video #nsYGC2aUwfQ&quot; /&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;play&quot;&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;icon icon-play&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;div&gt;Puzzle Driven Development (webinar #23); 6 April 2017.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, the reality of the project is very different. In just a few hours, I receive a call from my friend saying that a he’s found a few bugs in the tool. He is asking me to fix them. Now, I can see that the project is not done. In fact, it’s broken. It has a few bugs in it, which means a few tasks to complete.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I’m going to fix the project, by removing the bugs. I implement a new version of the software, name it 0.0.2 and ship it to my friend. Again, I believe my project is finished. It is fixed and should be closed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This scenario repeats itself again and again until my friend stops calling me. In other words, until he stops breaking my project.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is obvious that the more my friend breaks my project, the higher the &lt;a href=&quot;/2017/04/11/flexibility-equates-lower-quality.html&quot;&gt;quality&lt;/a&gt; of the software delivered ultimately at the end. Version 0.0.1 was just a very preliminary version, although I considered it final at the time I released it. In a few months, after I learn of and fix hundreds of bugs, version 3.5.17 will be much more mature and stable.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is the result of this “fix and break” approach.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;picture&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.yegor256.com/images/2014/04/time-and-mess-diagram.png&quot; style=&quot;width:600px;max-width:100%;&quot; alt=&quot;picture&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;The diagram shows the relation between time and mess in the project. The bugs my friend is reporting to me are breaking the project, increasing its instability (or simply its messiness). New versions I release resolve the bugs and are fixing the project. Your &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/04/15/github-guidelines.html&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; commit dynamics should resemble this graph, for example:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;picture&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.yegor256.com/images/2014/04/jcabi-github-commits-graph.png&quot; style=&quot;width:600px;max-width:100%;&quot; alt=&quot;picture&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;When the project starts, its messiness is rather low, and then it starts to grow. The messiness then reaches its peak and starts to go down.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;project-manager&quot;&gt;Project Manager&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The job of a project &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/09/22/micromanagement.html&quot;&gt;manager&lt;/a&gt; is to do as much as possible to fix the project. He has to use the sponsor’s time and money in order to remove all bugs and inconsistencies and return the project back to a “fixed” state.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;jb_picture&quot;&gt;&lt;img itemprop=&quot;image&quot; alt=&quot;Pulp Fiction (1994) by Quentin Tarantino&quot; src=&quot;/images/2014/04/pulp-fiction-mr-wolf-with-cup.png&quot; longdesc=&quot;#bbf6ed94&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption id=&quot;bbf6ed94&quot;&gt;Pulp Fiction (1994) by Quentin Tarantino&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;When I say “bugs,” I mean more than just software errors but also:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;unclear or ambiguous &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/11/10/ten-mistakes-in-specs.html&quot;&gt;requirements&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;features not yet implemented&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;functional and non-functional bugs&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;lack of test coverage&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;unresolved &lt;code&gt;@todo&lt;/code&gt; markers&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;lack of risk analysis&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;etc.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;The project manager gives me tasks that he wants done in order to fix and stabilize the project to return it back to a bug-free state.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;My job, as a member of a software team, is to help him perform the needed fixes and, at the same time, do my best to break the project! In the example with my friend, he was breaking the project constantly by reporting bugs to me. This is how he helped both of us increase the final quality of the product.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I should do the same and always try to report new bugs when I’m working on some feature. I should &lt;strong&gt;fix and break&lt;/strong&gt; at the same time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now let’s take a closer look at project roles.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;system-analyst&quot;&gt;System Analyst&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;A product owner submits an informal feature request, which usually starts with “it would be nice to have…” I’m a system analyst and my job is to translate owner’s English into &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/11/10/ten-mistakes-in-specs.html&quot;&gt;formal specifications&lt;/a&gt; in the SRS, understandable both by programmers and myself. It’s not my responsibility to implement the feature.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;picture&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.yegor256.com/images/2014/04/arizona-dream-two-beers-and-two-shots.png&quot; style=&quot;width:600px;max-width:100%;&quot; alt=&quot;Arizona Dream (1992) by Emir Kusturica&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Arizona Dream (1992) by Emir Kusturica&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;My task is complete when a new version of the SRS is signed by the Change Control Board. I’m an interpreter for the product owners, translating from their language to formal language needed in the SRS document. My only customer is the product owner. As soon as she closes the feature request, I’ll be paid.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Besides feature requests from product owners, I often receive complaints about the quality of the SRS. The document may not be clear enough for some team members. Therefore, it’s my job to resolve clarity problems and fix the SRS. These team members are also my customers. When they close their &lt;a href=&quot;/2018/04/24/right-way-to-report-bugs.html&quot;&gt;bug reports&lt;/a&gt;, I’ll be paid.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In both cases (a feature request or a bug,) I can make changes to the SRS immediately - if I have enough time. However, it’s not always possible. I can submit a bug and wait for its resolution; but, I don’t want to keep my customers waiting.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is where puzzle driven development helps me. Instead of submitting bug reports, I add “&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/To_be_announced&quot;&gt;TBD&lt;/a&gt;” puzzles in the SRS document. The puzzles are informal replacements of normally very strict formal requirements. They satisfy my customer, since they are in plain English, and are understandable by technical people.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thus, when I don’t have time, I don’t wait. I change the SRS using TBD-s at points where I can’t create a proper and formal description of the requirements or simply don’t know what to write exactly.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;architect&quot;&gt;Architect&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now, I’m the &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/07/21/convince-me.html&quot;&gt;architect&lt;/a&gt;, and my task is to implement a requirement, which has been formally specified in the SRS. PM is expecting a working feature from me, which I can deliver only when the architecture is clear and classes have been designed and implemented.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;picture&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.yegor256.com/images/2014/04/science-of-sleep-time-machine.png&quot; style=&quot;width:600px;max-width:100%;&quot; alt=&quot;The Science of Sleep (2006) by Michel Gondry&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The Science of Sleep (2006) by Michel Gondry&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Being an architect, I’m responsible for assembling all of the components together and making sure they fit. In most cases, I’m not creating them myself, but I’m telling everybody how they should be created. My work flow of artifacts is the following:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uml/d892698103dc5669949527a8754c5f26.svg&quot; style=&quot;width:75%&quot; alt=&quot;PlantUML SVG diagram&quot; class=&quot;plantuml&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I receive &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/11/10/ten-mistakes-in-specs.html&quot;&gt;requirements&lt;/a&gt; from the SRS, produce UML diagrams and explain to designers how to create source code according to my diagrams. I don’t really care how source code is implemented. I’m more concerned with the interaction of components and how well the entire architecture satisfies functional and non-functional (!) requirements.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;My task will be closed and paid when the system analyst changes its state to “implemented” in the SRS. The system analyst is my only customer. I have to sell my solution to him. Project manager will close my task and pay me when system analyst changes the status of the functional requirement from “specified” to “implemented.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The task sounds big, and I have only half an hour. Obviously, puzzle driven development should help me. I will create many tickets and puzzles. For example:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;SRS doesn’t explain requirements properly&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Non-functional requirements are not clear&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;UML diagrams are not clear enough&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Components are not implemented&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Build is not automated&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Continuous integration is not configured&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Quality of code is not under control&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Performance testing is not automated&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;When all of my puzzles are resolved, I can get back to my main task and finish feature implementation. Obviously, this may take a long time - days or even weeks.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But, the time cost of the main task is less than an hour. What is the point of all this hard work? Well, it’s simple; I’ll earn my hours from all the bugs reported. From this small half-an-hour task, I will generate many tickets, and every one of them will give me extra cash.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;designer-and-programmer&quot;&gt;Designer and Programmer&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The only real differences between designer and programmer are the complexity of their respective tasks and the hourly rates they receive. Designers usually do more complex and higher level implementations, while programmers implement all low-level details.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;picture&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.yegor256.com/images/2014/04/pulp-fiction-vincent-and-jules.png&quot; style=&quot;width:600px;max-width:100%;&quot; alt=&quot;Pulp Fiction (1994) by Quentin Tarantino&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Pulp Fiction (1994) by Quentin Tarantino&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;I’m a programmer and my task is to implement a class or method or to fix some functional bug. In most cases, I have only half an hour available. And, most tasks are bigger and require more time than that.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Puzzle driven development helps me break my task into smaller sub-tasks. I &lt;a href=&quot;/2017/03/24/tdd-that-works.html&quot;&gt;always&lt;/a&gt; start with a unit test. In the unit test, I’m trying to reproduce a bug or model the feature. When my test fails, I commit it and determine the amount of time I have left. If I still have time to make it pass—I do it, commit the changes and report to the project manager.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If I don’t have time to implement the fix, I mark pieces of code that don’t already have &lt;code&gt;@todo&lt;/code&gt; markers, commit them and report to the project manager that I’ve finished.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As you see, I’m fixing the code and breaking it at the same time. I’m fixing it with my new unit test, but breaking it with &lt;code&gt;@todo&lt;/code&gt; puzzles.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is how I help to increase the overall quality of the project - by fixing and breaking at the same time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;tester&quot;&gt;Tester&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;I’m a tester and my primary motivation is to find bugs. This may be contradictory to what you’ve heard before; but in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.xdsd.org&quot;&gt;XDSD&lt;/a&gt;, we plan to find a certain amount of bugs at every stage of the project.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;picture&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.yegor256.com/images/2014/04/fear-and-loathing-adrenochrome.png&quot; style=&quot;width:600px;max-width:100%;&quot; alt=&quot;Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (1998) by Terry Gilliam&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (1998) by Terry Gilliam&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;As as a tester, I receive tasks from my project manager. These tasks usually resemble “review feature X and find 10 bugs in it.” The project manager needs a certain number of bugs to be found in order to fix the project. From his point of view, the project is fixed when, say, 200 bugs have been found. That’s why he asks me to find more.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thus, to respond to the request, i find bugs to do my part in regard to the “fixing” part of the bigger picture. At the same time, though, I can find defects on my own and report them. This is the “breaking” part of my mission.&lt;/p&gt; " /> <meta name="keywords" content="next, path, output, content, previous, url, relative_path, id, collection, excerpt, draft, categories, layout, title, date, tags, description, keywords, image, jb_picture, slug, ext" /> <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1"/> <meta name="google-site-verification" content="JEj_gQr2CPe2QKGw8XdMz0R7VboQIUbX3FlM-lwTq-8" /> <meta name="author" content="Yegor Bugayenko"> <meta name="article:published_time" content="2014-04-12 00:00:00 +0000"> <meta name="og:site_name" content="Yegor Bugayenko"/> <meta name="og:type" content="article" /> <meta name="og:locale" content="en_US" /> <meta name="twitter:account_id" content="4503599630178231" /> <meta name="twitter:creator" content="@yegor256"/> <meta name="twitter:site" content="@yegor256"/> <meta name="twitter:title" property="og:title" content="PDD by Roles"/> <meta name="twitter:description" property="og:description" content="&lt;figure class=&quot;badge&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.xdsd.org&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.xdsd.org/images/logo.svg&quot; style=&quot;width:100px;max-width:100%;&quot; alt=&quot;badge&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;In this post, I’ll try to walk you through a project managed with the spirit of &lt;a href=&quot;/2010/03/04/pdd.html&quot;&gt;Puzzle Driven Development&lt;/a&gt; (PDD). As I do this, I will attempt to convey typical points of view of various project members.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Basically, there are a few key &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/07/10/software-project-roles.html&quot;&gt;roles&lt;/a&gt; in any software team:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Project Manager—assigns tasks and pays on completion&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;System Analyst—documents the product owner’s ideas&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Architect—defines how system components interact&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Designer—implements most complex components&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Programmer—implements all components&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Tester—finds and reports bugs&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Everybody, except the &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/05/24/who-is-project-manager.html&quot;&gt;project manager&lt;/a&gt;, affects the project in two ways: they fix it and they break it at the same time. Let me explain this with a simple example.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;!--more--&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;fix-and-break&quot;&gt;Fix and Break&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Let’s assume, for the sake of simplicity, that a project is a simple software tool written by me for a close friend. I created the first draft version 0.0.1 and delivered it to him. For me, the project is done. I’ve completed the work, and hopefully will never have to return to it again.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;youtube&quot;&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsYGC2aUwfQ&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;box&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nsYGC2aUwfQ/mqdefault.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;YouTube video #nsYGC2aUwfQ&quot; /&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;play&quot;&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;icon icon-play&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;div&gt;Puzzle Driven Development (webinar #23); 6 April 2017.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, the reality of the project is very different. In just a few hours, I receive a call from my friend saying that a he’s found a few bugs in the tool. He is asking me to fix them. Now, I can see that the project is not done. In fact, it’s broken. It has a few bugs in it, which means a few tasks to complete.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I’m going to fix the project, by removing the bugs. I implement a new version of the software, name it 0.0.2 and ship it to my friend. Again, I believe my project is finished. It is fixed and should be closed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This scenario repeats itself again and again until my friend stops calling me. In other words, until he stops breaking my project.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is obvious that the more my friend breaks my project, the higher the &lt;a href=&quot;/2017/04/11/flexibility-equates-lower-quality.html&quot;&gt;quality&lt;/a&gt; of the software delivered ultimately at the end. Version 0.0.1 was just a very preliminary version, although I considered it final at the time I released it. In a few months, after I learn of and fix hundreds of bugs, version 3.5.17 will be much more mature and stable.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is the result of this “fix and break” approach.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;picture&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.yegor256.com/images/2014/04/time-and-mess-diagram.png&quot; style=&quot;width:600px;max-width:100%;&quot; alt=&quot;picture&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;The diagram shows the relation between time and mess in the project. The bugs my friend is reporting to me are breaking the project, increasing its instability (or simply its messiness). New versions I release resolve the bugs and are fixing the project. Your &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/04/15/github-guidelines.html&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; commit dynamics should resemble this graph, for example:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;picture&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.yegor256.com/images/2014/04/jcabi-github-commits-graph.png&quot; style=&quot;width:600px;max-width:100%;&quot; alt=&quot;picture&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;When the project starts, its messiness is rather low, and then it starts to grow. The messiness then reaches its peak and starts to go down.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;project-manager&quot;&gt;Project Manager&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The job of a project &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/09/22/micromanagement.html&quot;&gt;manager&lt;/a&gt; is to do as much as possible to fix the project. He has to use the sponsor’s time and money in order to remove all bugs and inconsistencies and return the project back to a “fixed” state.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;jb_picture&quot;&gt;&lt;img itemprop=&quot;image&quot; alt=&quot;Pulp Fiction (1994) by Quentin Tarantino&quot; src=&quot;/images/2014/04/pulp-fiction-mr-wolf-with-cup.png&quot; longdesc=&quot;#bbf6ed94&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption id=&quot;bbf6ed94&quot;&gt;Pulp Fiction (1994) by Quentin Tarantino&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;When I say “bugs,” I mean more than just software errors but also:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;unclear or ambiguous &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/11/10/ten-mistakes-in-specs.html&quot;&gt;requirements&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;features not yet implemented&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;functional and non-functional bugs&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;lack of test coverage&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;unresolved &lt;code&gt;@todo&lt;/code&gt; markers&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;lack of risk analysis&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;etc.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;The project manager gives me tasks that he wants done in order to fix and stabilize the project to return it back to a bug-free state.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;My job, as a member of a software team, is to help him perform the needed fixes and, at the same time, do my best to break the project! In the example with my friend, he was breaking the project constantly by reporting bugs to me. This is how he helped both of us increase the final quality of the product.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I should do the same and always try to report new bugs when I’m working on some feature. I should &lt;strong&gt;fix and break&lt;/strong&gt; at the same time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now let’s take a closer look at project roles.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;system-analyst&quot;&gt;System Analyst&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;A product owner submits an informal feature request, which usually starts with “it would be nice to have…” I’m a system analyst and my job is to translate owner’s English into &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/11/10/ten-mistakes-in-specs.html&quot;&gt;formal specifications&lt;/a&gt; in the SRS, understandable both by programmers and myself. It’s not my responsibility to implement the feature.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;picture&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.yegor256.com/images/2014/04/arizona-dream-two-beers-and-two-shots.png&quot; style=&quot;width:600px;max-width:100%;&quot; alt=&quot;Arizona Dream (1992) by Emir Kusturica&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Arizona Dream (1992) by Emir Kusturica&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;My task is complete when a new version of the SRS is signed by the Change Control Board. I’m an interpreter for the product owners, translating from their language to formal language needed in the SRS document. My only customer is the product owner. As soon as she closes the feature request, I’ll be paid.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Besides feature requests from product owners, I often receive complaints about the quality of the SRS. The document may not be clear enough for some team members. Therefore, it’s my job to resolve clarity problems and fix the SRS. These team members are also my customers. When they close their &lt;a href=&quot;/2018/04/24/right-way-to-report-bugs.html&quot;&gt;bug reports&lt;/a&gt;, I’ll be paid.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In both cases (a feature request or a bug,) I can make changes to the SRS immediately - if I have enough time. However, it’s not always possible. I can submit a bug and wait for its resolution; but, I don’t want to keep my customers waiting.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is where puzzle driven development helps me. Instead of submitting bug reports, I add “&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/To_be_announced&quot;&gt;TBD&lt;/a&gt;” puzzles in the SRS document. The puzzles are informal replacements of normally very strict formal requirements. They satisfy my customer, since they are in plain English, and are understandable by technical people.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thus, when I don’t have time, I don’t wait. I change the SRS using TBD-s at points where I can’t create a proper and formal description of the requirements or simply don’t know what to write exactly.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;architect&quot;&gt;Architect&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now, I’m the &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/07/21/convince-me.html&quot;&gt;architect&lt;/a&gt;, and my task is to implement a requirement, which has been formally specified in the SRS. PM is expecting a working feature from me, which I can deliver only when the architecture is clear and classes have been designed and implemented.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;picture&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.yegor256.com/images/2014/04/science-of-sleep-time-machine.png&quot; style=&quot;width:600px;max-width:100%;&quot; alt=&quot;The Science of Sleep (2006) by Michel Gondry&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The Science of Sleep (2006) by Michel Gondry&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Being an architect, I’m responsible for assembling all of the components together and making sure they fit. In most cases, I’m not creating them myself, but I’m telling everybody how they should be created. My work flow of artifacts is the following:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uml/d892698103dc5669949527a8754c5f26.svg&quot; style=&quot;width:75%&quot; alt=&quot;PlantUML SVG diagram&quot; class=&quot;plantuml&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I receive &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/11/10/ten-mistakes-in-specs.html&quot;&gt;requirements&lt;/a&gt; from the SRS, produce UML diagrams and explain to designers how to create source code according to my diagrams. I don’t really care how source code is implemented. I’m more concerned with the interaction of components and how well the entire architecture satisfies functional and non-functional (!) requirements.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;My task will be closed and paid when the system analyst changes its state to “implemented” in the SRS. The system analyst is my only customer. I have to sell my solution to him. Project manager will close my task and pay me when system analyst changes the status of the functional requirement from “specified” to “implemented.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The task sounds big, and I have only half an hour. Obviously, puzzle driven development should help me. I will create many tickets and puzzles. For example:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;SRS doesn’t explain requirements properly&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Non-functional requirements are not clear&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;UML diagrams are not clear enough&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Components are not implemented&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Build is not automated&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Continuous integration is not configured&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Quality of code is not under control&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Performance testing is not automated&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;When all of my puzzles are resolved, I can get back to my main task and finish feature implementation. Obviously, this may take a long time - days or even weeks.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But, the time cost of the main task is less than an hour. What is the point of all this hard work? Well, it’s simple; I’ll earn my hours from all the bugs reported. From this small half-an-hour task, I will generate many tickets, and every one of them will give me extra cash.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;designer-and-programmer&quot;&gt;Designer and Programmer&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The only real differences between designer and programmer are the complexity of their respective tasks and the hourly rates they receive. Designers usually do more complex and higher level implementations, while programmers implement all low-level details.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;picture&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.yegor256.com/images/2014/04/pulp-fiction-vincent-and-jules.png&quot; style=&quot;width:600px;max-width:100%;&quot; alt=&quot;Pulp Fiction (1994) by Quentin Tarantino&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Pulp Fiction (1994) by Quentin Tarantino&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;I’m a programmer and my task is to implement a class or method or to fix some functional bug. In most cases, I have only half an hour available. And, most tasks are bigger and require more time than that.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Puzzle driven development helps me break my task into smaller sub-tasks. I &lt;a href=&quot;/2017/03/24/tdd-that-works.html&quot;&gt;always&lt;/a&gt; start with a unit test. In the unit test, I’m trying to reproduce a bug or model the feature. When my test fails, I commit it and determine the amount of time I have left. If I still have time to make it pass—I do it, commit the changes and report to the project manager.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If I don’t have time to implement the fix, I mark pieces of code that don’t already have &lt;code&gt;@todo&lt;/code&gt; markers, commit them and report to the project manager that I’ve finished.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As you see, I’m fixing the code and breaking it at the same time. I’m fixing it with my new unit test, but breaking it with &lt;code&gt;@todo&lt;/code&gt; puzzles.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is how I help to increase the overall quality of the project - by fixing and breaking at the same time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;tester&quot;&gt;Tester&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;I’m a tester and my primary motivation is to find bugs. This may be contradictory to what you’ve heard before; but in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.xdsd.org&quot;&gt;XDSD&lt;/a&gt;, we plan to find a certain amount of bugs at every stage of the project.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;picture&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.yegor256.com/images/2014/04/fear-and-loathing-adrenochrome.png&quot; style=&quot;width:600px;max-width:100%;&quot; alt=&quot;Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (1998) by Terry Gilliam&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (1998) by Terry Gilliam&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;As as a tester, I receive tasks from my project manager.

managed with the spirit of <a href="/2010/03/04/pdd.html">Puzzle Driven Development</a> (PDD). As I do this, I will attempt to convey typical points of view of various project members.</p><p>Basically, there are a few key <a href="/2016/07/10/software-project-roles.html">roles</a> in any software team:</p><ul> <li>Project Manager—assigns tasks and pays on completion</li> <li>System Analyst—documents the product owner’s ideas</li> <li>Architect—defines how system components interact</li> <li>Designer—implements most complex components</li> <li>Programmer—implements all components</li> <li>Tester—finds and reports bugs</li></ul><p>Everybody, except the <a href="/2016/05/24/who-is-project-manager.html">project manager</a>, affects the project in two ways: they fix it and they break it at the same time. Let me explain this with a simple example.</p><h2 id="fix-and-break">Fix and Break</h2><p>Let’s assume, for the sake of simplicity, that a project is a simple software tool written by me for a close friend. I created the first draft version 0.0.1 and delivered it to him. For me, the project is done. I’ve completed the work, and hopefully will never have to return to it again.</p><aside class="youtube"> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsYGC2aUwfQ"><div class="box"> <img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nsYGC2aUwfQ/mqdefault.jpg" alt="YouTube video #nsYGC2aUwfQ" /><div class="play"><i class="icon icon-play"></i></div></div></a><div>Puzzle Driven Development (webinar #23); 6 April 2017.</div></aside><p>However, the reality of the project is very different. In just a few hours, I receive a call from my friend saying that a he’s found a few bugs in the tool. He is asking me to fix them. Now, I can see that the project is not done. In fact, it’s broken. It has a few bugs in it, which means a few tasks to complete.</p><p>I’m going to fix the project, by removing the bugs. I implement a new version of the software, name it 0.0.2 and ship it to my friend. Again, I believe my project is finished. It is fixed and should be closed.</p><p>This scenario repeats itself again and again until my friend stops calling me. In other words, until he stops breaking my project.</p><p>It is obvious that the more my friend breaks my project, the higher the <a href="/2017/04/11/flexibility-equates-lower-quality.html">quality</a> of the software delivered ultimately at the end. Version 0.0.1 was just a very preliminary version, although I considered it final at the time I released it. In a few months, after I learn of and fix hundreds of bugs, version 3.5.17 will be much more mature and stable.</p><p>This is the result of this “fix and break” approach.</p><figure class="picture"><img src="https://www.yegor256.com/images/2014/04/time-and-mess-diagram.png" style="width:600px;max-width:100%;" alt="picture" /></figure><p>The diagram shows the relation between time and mess in the project. The bugs my friend is reporting to me are breaking the project, increasing its instability (or simply its messiness). New versions I release resolve the bugs and are fixing the project. Your <a href="/2014/04/15/github-guidelines.html">GitHub</a> commit dynamics should resemble this graph, for example:</p><figure class="picture"><img src="https://www.yegor256.com/images/2014/04/jcabi-github-commits-graph.png" style="width:600px;max-width:100%;" alt="picture" /></figure><p>When the project starts, its messiness is rather low, and then it starts to grow. The messiness then reaches its peak and starts to go down.</p><h2 id="project-manager">Project Manager</h2><p>The job of a project <a href="/2015/09/22/micromanagement.html">manager</a> is to do as much as possible to fix the project. He has to use the sponsor’s time and money in order to remove all bugs and inconsistencies and return the project back to a “fixed” state.</p><figure class="jb_picture"><img itemprop="image" alt="Pulp Fiction (1994) by Quentin Tarantino" src="/images/2014/04/pulp-fiction-mr-wolf-with-cup.png" longdesc="#bbf6ed94" /><figcaption id="bbf6ed94">Pulp Fiction (1994) by Quentin Tarantino</figcaption></figure><p>When I say “bugs,” I mean more than just software errors but also:</p><ul> <li>unclear or ambiguous <a href="/2015/11/10/ten-mistakes-in-specs.html">requirements</a></li> <li>features not yet implemented</li> <li>functional and non-functional bugs</li> <li>lack of test coverage</li> <li>unresolved <code>@todo</code> markers</li> <li>lack of risk analysis</li> <li>etc.</li></ul><p>The project manager gives me tasks that he wants done in order to fix and stabilize the project to return it back to a bug-free state.</p><p>My job, as a member of a software team, is to help him perform the needed fixes and, at the same time, do my best to break the project! In the example with my friend, he was breaking the project constantly by reporting bugs to me. This is how he helped both of us increase the final quality of the product.</p><p>I should do the same and always try to report new bugs when I’m working on some feature. I should <strong>fix and break</strong> at the same time.</p><p>Now let’s take a closer look at project roles.</p><h2 id="system-analyst">System Analyst</h2><p>A product owner submits an informal feature request, which usually starts with “it would be nice to have…” I’m a system analyst and my job is to translate owner’s English into <a href="/2015/11/10/ten-mistakes-in-specs.html">formal specifications</a> in the SRS, understandable both by programmers and myself. It’s not my responsibility to implement the feature.</p><figure class="picture"><img src="https://www.yegor256.com/images/2014/04/arizona-dream-two-beers-and-two-shots.png" style="width:600px;max-width:100%;" alt="Arizona Dream (1992) by Emir Kusturica" /><figcaption>Arizona Dream (1992) by Emir Kusturica</figcaption></figure><p>My task is complete when a new version of the SRS is signed by the Change Control Board. I’m an interpreter for the product owners, translating from their language to formal language needed in the SRS document. My only customer is the product owner. As soon as she closes the feature request, I’ll be paid.</p><p>Besides feature requests from product owners, I often receive complaints about the quality of the SRS. The document may not be clear enough for some team members. Therefore, it’s my job to resolve clarity problems and fix the SRS. These team members are also my customers. When they close their <a href="/2018/04/24/right-way-to-report-bugs.html">bug reports</a>, I’ll be paid.</p><p>In both cases (a feature request or a bug,) I can make changes to the SRS immediately - if I have enough time. However, it’s not always possible. I can submit a bug and wait for its resolution; but, I don’t want to keep my customers waiting.</p><p>This is where puzzle driven development helps me. Instead of submitting bug reports, I add “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/To_be_announced">TBD</a>” puzzles in the SRS document. The puzzles are informal replacements of normally very strict formal requirements. They satisfy my customer, since they are in plain English, and are understandable by technical people.</p><p>Thus, when I don’t have time, I don’t wait. I change the SRS using TBD-s at points where I can’t create a proper and formal description of the requirements or simply don’t know what to write exactly.</p><h2 id="architect">Architect</h2><p>Now, I’m the <a href="/2016/07/21/convince-me.html">architect</a>, and my task is to implement a requirement, which has been formally specified in the SRS. PM is expecting a working feature from me, which I can deliver only when the architecture is clear and classes have been designed and implemented.</p><figure class="picture"><img src="https://www.yegor256.com/images/2014/04/science-of-sleep-time-machine.png" style="width:600px;max-width:100%;" alt="The Science of Sleep (2006) by Michel Gondry" /><figcaption>The Science of Sleep (2006) by Michel Gondry</figcaption></figure><p>Being an architect, I’m responsible for assembling all of the components together and making sure they fit. In most cases, I’m not creating them myself, but I’m telling everybody how they should be created. My work flow of artifacts is the following:</p><p><img src="/uml/d892698103dc5669949527a8754c5f26.svg" style="width:75%" alt="PlantUML SVG diagram" class="plantuml" /></p><p>I receive <a href="/2015/11/10/ten-mistakes-in-specs.html">requirements</a> from the SRS, produce UML diagrams and explain to designers how to create source code according to my diagrams. I don’t really care how source code is implemented. I’m more concerned with the interaction of components and how well the entire architecture satisfies functional and non-functional (!) requirements.</p><p>My task will be closed and paid when the system analyst changes its state to “implemented” in the SRS. The system analyst is my only customer. I have to sell my solution to him. Project manager will close my task and pay me when system analyst changes the status of the functional requirement from “specified” to “implemented.”</p><p>The task sounds big, and I have only half an hour. Obviously, puzzle driven development should help me. I will create many tickets and puzzles. For example:</p><ul> <li>SRS doesn’t explain requirements properly</li> <li>Non-functional requirements are not clear</li> <li>UML diagrams are not clear enough</li> <li>Components are not implemented</li> <li>Build is not automated</li> <li>Continuous integration is not configured</li> <li>Quality of code is not under control</li> <li>Performance testing is not automated</li></ul><p>When all of my puzzles are resolved, I can get back to my main task and finish feature implementation. Obviously, this may take a long time - days or even weeks.</p><p>But, the time cost of the main task is less than an hour. What is the point of all this hard work? Well, it’s simple; I’ll earn my hours from all the bugs reported. From this small half-an-hour task, I will generate many tickets, and every one of them will give me extra cash.</p><h2 id="designer-and-programmer">Designer and Programmer</h2><p>The only real differences between designer and programmer are the complexity of their respective tasks and the hourly rates they receive. Designers usually do more complex and higher level implementations, while programmers implement all low-level details.</p><figure class="picture"><img src="https://www.yegor256.com/images/2014/04/pulp-fiction-vincent-and-jules.png" style="width:600px;max-width:100%;" alt="Pulp Fiction (1994) by Quentin Tarantino" /><figcaption>Pulp Fiction (1994) by Quentin Tarantino</figcaption></figure><p>I’m a programmer and my task is to implement a class or method or to fix some functional bug. In most cases, I have only half an hour available. And, most tasks are bigger and require more time than that.</p><p>Puzzle driven development helps me break my task into smaller sub-tasks. I <a href="/2017/03/24/tdd-that-works.html">always</a> start with a unit test. In the unit test, I’m trying to reproduce a bug or model the feature. When my test fails, I commit it and determine the amount of time I have left. If I still have time to make it pass—I do it, commit the changes and report to the project manager.</p><p>If I don’t have time to implement the fix, I mark pieces of code that don’t already have <code>@todo</code> markers, commit them and report to the project manager that I’ve finished.</p><p>As you see, I’m fixing the code and breaking it at the same time. I’m fixing it with my new unit test, but breaking it with <code>@todo</code> puzzles.</p><p>This is how I help to increase the overall quality of the project - by fixing and breaking at the same time.</p><h2 id="tester">Tester</h2><p>I’m a tester and my primary motivation is to find bugs. This may be contradictory to what you’ve heard before; but in <a href="https://www.xdsd.org">XDSD</a>, we plan to find a certain amount of bugs at every stage of the project.</p><figure class="picture"><img src="https://www.yegor256.com/images/2014/04/fear-and-loathing-adrenochrome.png" style="width:600px;max-width:100%;" alt="Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (1998) by Terry Gilliam" /><figcaption>Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (1998) by Terry Gilliam</figcaption></figure><p>As as a tester, I receive tasks from my project manager. These tasks usually resemble “review feature X and find 10 bugs in it.” The project manager needs a certain number of bugs to be found in order to fix the project. From his point of view, the project is fixed when, say, 200 bugs have been found. That’s why he asks me to find more.</p><p>Thus, to respond to the request, i find bugs to do my part in regard to the “fixing” part of the bigger picture. At the same time, though, I can find defects on my own and report them. This is the “breaking” part of my mission.</p></p><nav class="buttons notranslate desktop-only"> <a href="http://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://www.yegor256.com/2014/04/12/puzzle-driven-development-by-roles.html" title="Share on Facebook" class="button" rel="nofollow"> <span class="count count-facebook">0</span> <i class="icon icon-facebook notranslate" aria-hidden="true"></i> </a> <a href="https://twitter.com/share?url=https://www.yegor256.com/2014/04/12/puzzle-driven-development-by-roles.html&amp;text=PDD+by+Roles" title="Share on Twitter" class="button" rel="nofollow"> <span class="count count-twitter">0</span> <i class="icon icon-twitter notranslate" aria-hidden="true"></i> </a> <a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=https://www.yegor256.com/2014/04/12/puzzle-driven-development-by-roles.html" title="Share on Google+" class="button" rel="nofollow"> <span class="count count-googleplus">0</span> <i class="icon icon-googleplus notranslate" aria-hidden="true"></i> </a> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/cws/share?url=https://www.yegor256.com/2014/04/12/puzzle-driven-development-by-roles.html" title="Share on LinkedIn" class="button" rel="nofollow"> <span class="count count-linkedin">0</span> <i class="icon icon-linkedin notranslate" aria-hidden="true"></i> </a> <a href="http://reddit.com/submit?url=https://www.yegor256.com/2014/04/12/puzzle-driven-development-by-roles.html%3F2014-14&amp;title=PDD+by+Roles" title="Share on Reddit" class="button" rel="nofollow"> <span class="count count-reddit">0</span> <i class="icon icon-reddit notranslate" aria-hidden="true"></i> </a> <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/submitlink?u=https://www.yegor256.com/2014/04/12/puzzle-driven-development-by-roles.html%3F2014-14&amp;t=PDD+by+Roles" title="Share on Hacker News" class="button" rel="nofollow"> <span class="count count-hackernews">0</span> <i class="icon icon-hackernews notranslate" aria-hidden="true"></i> </a> </nav> </header> <article class="main" itemprop="articleBody"><div > <figure class="badge"><a href="https://www.xdsd.org"><img src="https://www.xdsd.org/images/logo.svg" style="width:100px;max-width:100%;" alt="badge" /></a></figure><p>In this post, I’ll try to walk you through a project managed with the spirit of <a href="/2010/03/04/pdd.html">Puzzle Driven Development</a> (PDD).

When my test fails, I commit it and determine the amount of time I have left. If I still have time to make it pass—I do it, commit the changes and report to the project manager.</p><p>If I don’t have time to implement the fix, I mark pieces of code that don’t already have <code>@todo</code> markers, commit them and report to the project manager that I’ve finished.</p><p>As you see, I’m fixing the code and breaking it at the same time. I’m fixing it with my new unit test, but breaking it with <code>@todo</code> puzzles.</p><p>This is how I help to increase the overall quality of the project - by fixing and breaking at the same time.</p><h2 id="tester">Tester</h2><p>I’m a tester and my primary motivation is to find bugs. This may be contradictory to what you’ve heard before; but in <a href="https://www.xdsd.org">XDSD</a>, we plan to find a certain amount of bugs at every stage of the project.</p><figure class="picture"><img src="https://www.yegor256.com/images/2014/04/fear-and-loathing-adrenochrome.png" style="width:600px;max-width:100%;" alt="Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (1998) by Terry Gilliam" /><figcaption>Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (1998) by Terry Gilliam</figcaption></figure><p>As as a tester, I receive tasks from my project manager. These tasks usually resemble “review feature X and find 10 bugs in it.” The project manager needs a certain number of bugs to be found in order to fix the project. From his point of view, the project is fixed when, say, 200 bugs have been found. That’s why he asks me to find more.</p><p>Thus, to respond to the request, i find bugs to do my part in regard to the “fixing” part of the bigger picture. At the same time, though, I can find defects on my own and report them. This is the “breaking” part of my mission.</p></div></article></div><div class="wrapper"> <related-posts /></div><div class="disqus" role="complementary"><p class="disqus_hint"> Please, use <a href="https://help.disqus.com/commenting/what-html-tags-are-allowed-within-comments">syntax highlighting</a> in your comments, to make them more readable.</p><div id="disqus_thread" class="disqus-thread"> <a>&nbsp;</a></div><script> var disqus_config = function () { this.page.url = document.location.href.split('?')[0].split('#')[0].replace('https://', 'http://'); this.page.identifier = this.page.url; }; (function() { var d = document, s = d.createElement('script'); s.src = '//yegor256.disqus.com/embed.js'; s.setAttribute('data-timestamp', +new Date()); (d.head || d.body).appendChild(s); })(); </script> <noscript><div><p class="red"> JavaScript is disabled in your browser, that's why you can't see comments under this post.</p></div></noscript></div><div class="wrapper"> <footer class="footer"><p> &copy; <span itemscope="" itemprop="copyrightHolder" itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"> <span itemprop="name">Yegor Bugayenko</span> </span> 2014&ndash;<span itemprop="copyrightYear">2018</span></p></footer></div></section><div class="wrapper unprintable" style="text-align:center;margin-top:2em;"> <a href="http://www.sixnines.io/h/3ba1652f"> <img src="//www.sixnines.io/b/3ba1652f?style=flat" alt="sixnines availability badge"/> </a></div><script src="//code.jquery.com/jquery-1.9.0.min.js"></script> <script src="/js/all.js?c998b88f617"></script> <script>var disqus_shortname = 'yegor256';</script> <script id="dsq-count-scr" src="//yegor256.disqus.com/count.js" async="async"></script> <script> (function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){ (i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o), m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m) })(window,document,'script','//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga'); ga('create', 'UA-1963507-32', 'auto'); ga('send', 'pageview'); </script> <script> Cd=document;Cr="&"+Math.random();Cp="&s=1"; Cd.cookie="b=b";if(Cd.cookie)Cp+="&c=1"; Cp+="&t="+(new Date()).getTimezoneOffset(); if(self!=top)Cp+="&f=1"; </script> <script> if(navigator.javaEnabled())Cp+="&j=1"; </script> <script> if(typeof(screen)!='undefined')Cp+="&w="+screen.width+"&h="+ screen.height+"&d="+(screen.colorDepth?screen.colorDepth:screen.pixelDepth); </script> <script> Cd.write("<img src='//c.hit.ua/hit?i=95870&g=0&x=2"+Cp+Cr+ "&r="+escape(Cd.referrer)+"&u="+escape(window.location.href)+ "' border='0' wi"+"dth='1' he"+"ight='1'/>"); </script> <script type="application/ld+json"> { "@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Person", "name": "Yegor Bugayenko", "url": "https://www.yegor256.com", "sameAs": [ "https://www.facebook.com/yegor256", "https://instagram.com/yegor256", "https://www.linkedin.com/in/yegor256", "https://twitter.com/yegor256", "https://github.com/yegor256", "https://www.pinterest.com/yegor256/" ] } </script> </body> </html> <!DOCTYPE html> <html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/WebSite"> <head> <meta charset="utf-8"/> <meta name="description" content="&lt;figure class=&quot;badge&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.xdsd.org&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.xdsd.org/images/logo.svg&quot; style=&quot;width:100px;max-width:100%;&quot; alt=&quot;badge&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Yes, I know, “line of code” (LoC) is a &lt;a href=&quot;http://stackoverflow.com/questions/966800/mythical-man-month-10-lines-per-developer-day-how-close-on-large-projects&quot;&gt;very wrong metric&lt;/a&gt;.

There were about 20 of them (I’m not counting &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/09/22/micromanagement.html&quot;&gt;managers&lt;/a&gt;, analysts, product owners, SCRUM masters, etc.) The project was a web auctioning site with pretty high traffic numbers (over two million page views per day).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The code base size was about 200k lines, of which 150k was PHP, 35k JavaScript and the remainder CSS, XML, Ruby, and something else.

All tasks were tracked in JIRA.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;project-2-extremely-distributed&quot;&gt;Project #2: Extremely Distributed&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The second project was an open source Java product, developed by an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.xdsd.org&quot;&gt;extremely distributed&lt;/a&gt; team of about 15 developers. We didn’t have any chats or any other informal communications. We discussed everything in GitHub issues. The code base was significantly smaller with only about 30k lines, of which about 90% was Java and the rest in XML.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;picture&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.yegor256.com/images/2014/04/shaolin-temple-jet-li.png&quot; style=&quot;width:600px;max-width:100%;&quot; alt=&quot;Shaolin Temple (1982) by Chang Hsin Yen&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Shaolin Temple (1982) by Chang Hsin Yen&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;maturity-of-development&quot;&gt;Maturity of Development&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Both projects hosted their code bases on GitHub. Both teams were developing in &lt;a href=&quot;http://martinfowler.com/bliki/FeatureBranch.html&quot;&gt;feature branches&lt;/a&gt;- even for small fixes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Both teams used build automation, &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/10/08/continuous-integration-is-dead.html&quot;&gt;continuous integration&lt;/a&gt;, pre-flight builds, static analysis and code reviews. This indicates the maturity of the project teams.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Both projects satisfied the &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/11/10/ten-mistakes-in-specs.html&quot;&gt;requirements&lt;/a&gt; of their users. I’m mentioning this to emphasize that both projects produced valuable and useful lines of code. There was no garbage and almost no &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duplicate_code&quot;&gt;code duplication&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;show-me-the-money&quot;&gt;Show Me the Money&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;In both projects, my role was called that of lead architect, and I knew their financial details. Besides that, I had access to both Git repositories, so I can measure how many new lines (or changed lines) were introduced by both teams in, say, a three-month period.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now, let’s see the numbers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The first project (the one that was co-located) was paying approximately €50,000 annually to a good developer, which was about $5,600 per month or $35 per hour. The second one (the extremely distributed project) was paying $20-35 per hour, for completed tasks only according to one of the principles of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.xdsd.org&quot;&gt;XDSD&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The first one, in three months, produced 59k new lines and removed 29k in changes in the &lt;code&gt;master&lt;/code&gt; branch, which totals 88k lines of code. The project resulted in about 10,000 man hours to produce these lines (20 programmers, three months, 170 working hours per month)—which equates to about $350k. Therefore, the project &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/06/02/how-to-estimate-software-cost.html&quot;&gt;cost&lt;/a&gt; a whopping&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class=&quot;red center em2&quot;&gt;$3.98 per line&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The second project, in the same three month period, produced 45k new lines and removed 9k, which comes to 54k in all. To complete this work, we spent only $7k (approximately 350 working hours in 650 tasks). Thus, the project cost merely:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class=&quot;green center em2&quot;&gt;&amp;cent;13 per line&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This also means that programmers were writing approximately 150 lines per hour or over a thousand per day. &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mythical_Man-Month&quot;&gt;The Mythical Man-Month&lt;/a&gt; talks about 10 lines per day, which is a hundred times less than we saw in our project.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;$350k vs $7k, $3.98 vs ¢13? What do you think?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;how-to-validate-the-numbers&quot;&gt;How to Validate the Numbers?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you’re curious, I’m using &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/yegor256/hoc&quot;&gt;hoc&lt;/a&gt; to get the numbers from Git (it is explained in &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/11/14/hits-of-code.html&quot;&gt;Hits-of-Code Instead of SLoC&lt;/a&gt;). You can validate the numbers for the second project here on GitHub: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jcabi/jcabi-github&quot;&gt;jcabi/jcabi-github&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;What I’m trying to express with these numbers is that distributed programming is &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/08/05/distributed-teams-are-higher-quality.html&quot;&gt;much more effective&lt;/a&gt;, money-wise, than a co-located team. Again, I can hear you saying that “line of code” is not a proper metric. But, come on, $0.13 vs. $3.98? Thirty times more expensive?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;picture&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.yegor256.com/images/2014/04/lebowski-they-did-not-receive-the-money.png&quot; style=&quot;width:600px;max-width:100%;&quot; alt=&quot;The Big Lebowski (1998) by Joel Coen&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The Big Lebowski (1998) by Joel Coen&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s not about metrics any more. It’s about preventing wasteful man hours and the huge waste of money that comes with them?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;can-we-do-the-same&quot;&gt;Can We Do the Same?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Of course, the same results can’t be achieved by just telling your programmers to work from home and never come to the &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/10/06/how-to-be-good-office-slave.html&quot;&gt;office&lt;/a&gt;. XDSD is not about that. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.xdsd.org&quot;&gt;XDSD&lt;/a&gt; is about strict quality principles, which should be followed by the entire team.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And when these principles are in place—you pay thirty times less.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;By the way, this is what people say about their projects:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;$12–103: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.crazyontap.com/topic.php?TopicId=242135&quot;&gt;crazyontap.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;$15–40: &lt;a href=&quot;http://betterembsw.blogspot.nl/2010/10/embedded-software-costs-15-40-per-line.html&quot;&gt;betterembsw.blogspot.nl&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;over $5: &lt;a href=&quot;http://discuss.joelonsoftware.com/default.asp?biz.5.467536.25&quot;&gt;joelonsoftware.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;What are your numbers?

Again, I can hear you saying that “line of code” is not a proper metric. But, come on, $0.13 vs. $3.98?

Both teams were developing in <a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/FeatureBranch.html">feature branches</a>- even for small fixes.</p><p>Both teams used build automation, <a href="/2014/10/08/continuous-integration-is-dead.html">continuous integration</a>, pre-flight builds, static analysis and code reviews. This indicates the maturity of the project teams.</p><p>Both projects satisfied the <a href="/2015/11/10/ten-mistakes-in-specs.html">requirements</a> of their users. I’m mentioning this to emphasize that both projects produced valuable and useful lines of code. There was no garbage and almost no <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duplicate_code">code duplication</a>.</p><h2 id="show-me-the-money">Show Me the Money</h2><p>In both projects, my role was called that of lead architect, and I knew their financial details. Besides that, I had access to both Git repositories, so I can measure how many new lines (or changed lines) were introduced by both teams in, say, a three-month period.</p><p>Now, let’s see the numbers.</p><p>The first project (the one that was co-located) was paying approximately €50,000 annually to a good developer, which was about $5,600 per month or $35 per hour. The second one (the extremely distributed project) was paying $20-35 per hour, for completed tasks only according to one of the principles of <a href="https://www.xdsd.org">XDSD</a>.</p><p>The first one, in three months, produced 59k new lines and removed 29k in changes in the <code>master</code> branch, which totals 88k lines of code. The project resulted in about 10,000 man hours to produce these lines (20 programmers, three months, 170 working hours per month)—which equates to about $350k. Therefore, the project <a href="/2015/06/02/how-to-estimate-software-cost.html">cost</a> a whopping</p><p class="red center em2">$3.98 per line</p><p>The second project, in the same three month period, produced 45k new lines and removed 9k, which comes to 54k in all. To complete this work, we spent only $7k (approximately 350 working hours in 650 tasks). Thus, the project cost merely:</p><p class="green center em2">&cent;13 per line</p><p>This also means that programmers were writing approximately 150 lines per hour or over a thousand per day. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mythical_Man-Month">The Mythical Man-Month</a> talks about 10 lines per day, which is a hundred times less than we saw in our project.</p><p>$350k vs $7k, $3.98 vs ¢13?

The code base was significantly smaller with only about 30k lines, of which about 90% was Java and the rest in XML.</p><figure class="picture"><img src="https://www.yegor256.com/images/2014/04/shaolin-temple-jet-li.png" style="width:600px;max-width:100%;" alt="Shaolin Temple (1982) by Chang Hsin Yen" /><figcaption>Shaolin Temple (1982) by Chang Hsin Yen</figcaption></figure><h2 id="maturity-of-development">Maturity of Development</h2><p>Both projects hosted their code bases on GitHub. Both teams were developing in <a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/FeatureBranch.html">feature branches</a>- even for small fixes.</p><p>Both teams used build automation, <a href="/2014/10/08/continuous-integration-is-dead.html">continuous integration</a>, pre-flight builds, static analysis and code reviews. This indicates the maturity of the project teams.</p><p>Both projects satisfied the <a href="/2015/11/10/ten-mistakes-in-specs.html">requirements</a> of their users. I’m mentioning this to emphasize that both projects produced valuable and useful lines of code. There was no garbage and almost no <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duplicate_code">code duplication</a>.</p><h2 id="show-me-the-money">Show Me the Money</h2><p>In both projects, my role was called that of lead architect, and I knew their financial details. Besides that, I had access to both Git repositories, so I can measure how many new lines (or changed lines) were introduced by both teams in, say, a three-month period.</p><p>Now, let’s see the numbers.</p><p>The first project (the one that was co-located) was paying approximately €50,000 annually to a good developer, which was about $5,600 per month or $35 per hour. The second one (the extremely distributed project) was paying $20-35 per hour, for completed tasks only according to one of the principles of <a href="https://www.xdsd.org">XDSD</a>.</p><p>The first one, in three months, produced 59k new lines and removed 29k in changes in the <code>master</code> branch, which totals 88k lines of code. The project resulted in about 10,000 man hours to produce these lines (20 programmers, three months, 170 working hours per month)—which equates to about $350k. Therefore, the project <a href="/2015/06/02/how-to-estimate-software-cost.html">cost</a> a whopping</p><p class="red center em2">$3.98 per line</p><p>The second project, in the same three month period, produced 45k new lines and removed 9k, which comes to 54k in all. To complete this work, we spent only $7k (approximately 350 working hours in 650 tasks). Thus, the project cost merely:</p><p class="green center em2">&cent;13 per line</p><p>This also means that programmers were writing approximately 150 lines per hour or over a thousand per day. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mythical_Man-Month">The Mythical Man-Month</a> talks about 10 lines per day, which is a hundred times less than we saw in our project.</p><p>$350k vs $7k, $3.98 vs ¢13? What do you think?</p><h2 id="how-to-validate-the-numbers">How to Validate the Numbers?</h2><p>If you’re curious, I’m using <a href="https://github.com/yegor256/hoc">hoc</a> to get the numbers from Git (it is explained in <a href="/2014/11/14/hits-of-code.html">Hits-of-Code Instead of SLoC</a>). You can validate the numbers for the second project here on GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/jcabi/jcabi-github">jcabi/jcabi-github</a>.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>What I’m trying to express with these numbers is that distributed programming is <a href="/2016/08/05/distributed-teams-are-higher-quality.html">much more effective</a>, money-wise, than a co-located team. Again, I can hear you saying that “line of code” is not a proper metric. But, come on, $0.13 vs. $3.98? Thirty times more expensive?</p><figure class="picture"><img src="https://www.yegor256.com/images/2014/04/lebowski-they-did-not-receive-the-money.png" style="width:600px;max-width:100%;" alt="The Big Lebowski (1998) by Joel Coen" /><figcaption>The Big Lebowski (1998) by Joel Coen</figcaption></figure><p>It’s not about metrics any more. It’s about preventing wasteful man hours and the huge waste of money that comes with them?</p><h2 id="can-we-do-the-same">Can We Do the Same?</h2><p>Of course, the same results can’t be achieved by just telling your programmers to work from home and never come to the <a href="/2015/10/06/how-to-be-good-office-slave.html">office</a>. XDSD is not about that. <a href="https://www.xdsd.org">XDSD</a> is about strict quality principles, which should be followed by the entire team.</p><p>And when these principles are in place—you pay thirty times less.</p><p>By the way, this is what people say about their projects:</p><ul> <li>$12–103: <a href="http://www.crazyontap.com/topic.php?TopicId=242135">crazyontap.com</a></li> <li>$15–40: <a href="http://betterembsw.blogspot.nl/2010/10/embedded-software-costs-15-40-per-line.html">betterembsw.blogspot.nl</a></li> <li>over $5: <a href="http://discuss.joelonsoftware.com/default.asp?biz.5.467536.25">joelonsoftware.com</a></li></ul><p>What are your numbers?
