clients yesterday. He texted me today: “[At Zerocracy] there is no commitment and anybody is free to leave any time, so the risk of entrusting a highly important project to such a platform and failing to deliver it on time is very high. We will develop it on our own with hired developers who will have salaries, and I’ll be architect and project manager, that way it will be under our entire control.” I think this word “control” he used deserves a comment.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;!--more--&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;jb_picture&quot;&gt;&lt;img itemprop=&quot;image&quot; alt=&quot;The Drop (2014) by Michaël R. Roskam&quot; src=&quot;/images/2018/10/the-drop.jpg&quot; longdesc=&quot;#c9f2bfd5&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption id=&quot;c9f2bfd5&quot;&gt;The Drop (2014) by Michaël R. Roskam&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;First, I know how much we hate the word “control” when it’s being applied to us sensitive and fragile individuals, also known as computer geeks. We don’t want to be under anyone’s control. We also don’t want to control others. We prefer to think that things just move forward on their own, not because someone stays on top of them and controls them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, this is an illusion.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We and our projects have to be under control in order for the projects to be completed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;OK, replace it with managed, organized, or (I love this word) orchestrated.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The bottom line is: you control it or you lose it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What does control technically mean? According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_%28management%29&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;, it means “setting standards, measuring actual performance and taking &lt;em&gt;corrective action&lt;/em&gt;.” What are the corrective actions in the context of people management? There are two: rewards and punishments. In order to keep even the &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/08/13/strict-code-quality-control.html&quot;&gt;most talented people&lt;/a&gt; under control, we have to reward them for their successes and punish or &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/09/16/how-to-fire-someone-right.html&quot;&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt; them for their failures.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The question is how you do that. How do you reward and how do you punish?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Even if you don’t want to admit that you do it, you still do. You reward and you punish. How does it happen in a traditional management model with the “hired developers” my prospective client was talking about? I’ve explained it already in a few blog posts. &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/12/06/how-to-pay-programmers-less.html&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;How to Pay Programmers Less&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/01/05/how-to-punish-employees.html&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;How Do You Punish Your Employees?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; are probably the best two of them. Managers invent &lt;a href=&quot;/2018/08/29/soft-skills.html&quot;&gt;nice words&lt;/a&gt; for these things, but in reality it’s still the same carrot-and-stick, only with no predictability and no explicit &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/10/13/competition-without-rules.html&quot;&gt;rules&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, if you think that you can control &lt;em&gt;professional&lt;/em&gt; programmers using the methods explained in my blog posts above, you are mistaken. We are way smarter than you. We know how to pretend to be working, while doing something else. We know how to create an illusion that we are loyal to the project, while searching the market for a new job. We know how to organize our time such that you only get ten percent of it, if you are lucky. We know &lt;a href=&quot;/2017/08/01/how-to-manage-a-manager.html&quot;&gt;how to manage&lt;/a&gt; you, our &lt;del&gt;stupid&lt;/del&gt; managers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As our manager, expecting us to be under control and loyal just because you hired us with &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/07/21/hourly-pay-modern-slavery.html&quot;&gt;monthly salaries&lt;/a&gt;, you are demonstrating only one thing to us: you have no idea how to manage senior developers. Instead, we will manage you. You will be under our control, not the other way around. If you are lucky, the project will &lt;em&gt;maybe&lt;/em&gt; see its end. But in most cases this doesn’t happen.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Do you want to know what real control is? Read this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zerocracy.com/policy.html&quot;&gt;Policy&lt;/a&gt;, which is how we &lt;em&gt;control&lt;/em&gt; programming in Zerocracy. That is the level of control true professionals enjoy. That document, fully supported by our &lt;a href=&quot;/2018/03/21/zerocracy-announcement.html&quot;&gt;automated chatbot&lt;/a&gt;, guides every small piece of reward and punishment a programmer may have on a project.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is what true commitment means for our guys: personal and &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/04/13/no-obligations-principle.html&quot;&gt;explicit responsibility&lt;/a&gt; for every single step they make. This level of commitment is incomparably better than what you will likely find when hiring full-time 9-to-5 &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/10/06/how-to-be-good-office-slave.html&quot;&gt;office&lt;/a&gt; &lt;del&gt;slaves&lt;/del&gt; employees.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What are they really committed to? To giving you a month’s notice when they finally find a better place to scroll through Facebook eight hours a day?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Seriously?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Who really is in charge, you or your boss? &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/codeahead?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#codeahead&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Yegor Bugayenko (@yegor256) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/yegor256/status/1048824708068777984?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;October 7, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt; " /> <meta name="keywords" content="next, path, output, content, previous, url, relative_path, id, collection, excerpt, draft, categories, layout, title, date, place, tags, description, keywords, image, jb_picture, slug, ext" /> <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1"/> <meta name="google-site-verification" content="JEj_gQr2CPe2QKGw8XdMz0R7VboQIUbX3FlM-lwTq-8" /> <meta name="author" content="Yegor Bugayenko"> <meta name="article:published_time" content="2018-10-09 00:00:00 +0000"> <meta name="og:site_name" content="Yegor Bugayenko"/> <meta name="og:type" content="article" /> <meta name="og:locale" content="en_US" /> <meta name="twitter:account_id" content="4503599630178231" /> <meta name="twitter:creator" content="@yegor256"/> <meta name="twitter:site" content="@yegor256"/> <meta name="twitter:title" property="og:title" content="You Think You Can Control Us?"/> <meta name="twitter:description" property="og:description" content="&lt;p&gt;I was explaining how &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zerocracy.com&quot;&gt;Zerocracy&lt;/a&gt; works to one of our prospective clients yesterday.

I will try not to repeat them. They mostly say reasonable things, like “be specific,” “choose a strong title,” “avoid duplicates,” and many others. My recommendations here are more of a psychological nature.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stay cool&lt;/strong&gt;. Don’t expect all of your bugs to be accepted and paid for. Some of them won’t be. This must not stop you from reporting them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Present it as if the entire world will collapse tomorrow if they don't fix it.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exaggerate&lt;/strong&gt;. No matter how minor the bug is, present it as if the entire world will collapse tomorrow if they don’t fix it. Of course, they will make their own decision about the priority and severity of the bug, but don’t help them to make it against you.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Victimize yourself&lt;/strong&gt;. Don’t just say “the class is broken”—there is no victim in this statement. So, no need to save anyone’s life. The bug is minor—no need to pay. Instead, say “I can’t use the class.” Present yourself as a victim. Or even better, represent a group of victims: “Nobody can really use this class.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Push them&lt;/strong&gt;. If a bug report is not paid for, don’t hesitate to ask why. Insist that it was a very important problem and you deserve to be paid. If they still don’t pay, forget it and move on. You must not look like it offends you somehow.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Show efforts&lt;/strong&gt;. The bug description must look “rich,” clearly demonstrating that you invested a lot of effort in its creation. If there is just a single line, it’s easier for them to not pay you—they won’t feel any guilt. However, if it’s long, detailed, properly formatted, and contains multiple supporting links, they will feel bad if they don’t pay.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Look engaged&lt;/strong&gt;. Say something like “I’m ready to investigate more and provide additional details, if you need me too.” Of course you won’t do that (in most cases), but you have to say it. This will look like you care and this bug comes right from your heart. How can they not pay for it?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Look altruistic&lt;/strong&gt;. Don’t show them that you are reporting these bugs just to get money. They know that anyway, but still. Look like you care about the project and honestly want to help. Say that you worry about the users, about the market, about the mission, about the bigger scope, etc.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aggregate&lt;/strong&gt;. This may sound against the &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/11/24/principles-of-bug-tracking.html&quot;&gt;principles&lt;/a&gt; of bug tracking I suggested earlier, but when your bugs are small and cosmetic—aggregate them. In such a case you have a chance to win. They will reject three minor bugs, but they won’t reject a bigger one with three minor parts.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I believe that if you follow these simple recommendations, you will be a more successful bug reporter.

However, in &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.me/joinchat/CLxAaQ0xp-g_3WWI3MBr2g&quot;&gt;our Telegram group&lt;/a&gt;, where we talk about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zerocracy.com&quot;&gt;Zerocracy&lt;/a&gt;, some programmers keep asking me the same question over and over again: What should I do when the project is absolutely new to me, I have just &lt;a href=&quot;/2018/01/09/micro-budgeting.html&quot;&gt;30 minutes&lt;/a&gt;, and the bug is very complex?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;This literally means that you should always and only think about yourself and your personal profit.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;One of the core &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zerocracy.com/toc.html&quot;&gt;principles&lt;/a&gt; of Zerocracy is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXUwE3FGfpg&quot;&gt;#NoAltruism&lt;/a&gt;. This literally means that you should always and only think about yourself and your personal profit. You should not try to improve the project, to increase its quality, to fix the code, or to refactor anything… unless you are &lt;em&gt;paid&lt;/em&gt; for it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;First of all, when the task, which you are going to be paid for, is in front of you and you can’t understand how to solve it, &lt;em&gt;don’t&lt;/em&gt; blame yourself. You are not supposed to be an expert in the legacy code you just opened up. Strictly speaking, you are not supposed to be an expert in anything. A project, &lt;del&gt;unlike your mom&lt;/del&gt;, doesn’t expect you to be intelligent or tech-savvy. It needs you to &lt;a href=&quot;/2017/11/28/microtasking.html&quot;&gt;close tickets&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;youtube&quot;&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXUwE3FGfpg&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;box&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vXUwE3FGfpg/mqdefault.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;YouTube video #vXUwE3FGfpg&quot; /&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;play&quot;&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;icon icon-play&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;div&gt;#NoAltruism; 20 April 2018.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;Who do you blame, if not yourself, when the bug is serious, the code is messy, and you have no idea how much time it will take just to understand it, let alone fix it? Well, you can blame everybody around you, but first of all you should blame the code base itself. How do you blame it? You report its low quality by creating new tickets, which may sound like this:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;“The class X is not sufficiently documented, I don’t understand how it works.”&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;“The method X is too complex, I don’t know what it does.”&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;“The algorithm X is messy, I can’t figure out what it does.”&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;“The library X is used here, but I don’t understand why you don’t use library Y.”&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;“The rules of class naming are not clear, document them please.”&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;“The principle of data organization is not obvious, document it.”&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, don’t make the mistake many programmers are making when we tell them that tickets are the only &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/10/07/stop-chatting-start-coding.html&quot;&gt;right way&lt;/a&gt; to solve problems. They start asking questions and seeking help in the tickets, just like this:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;“How can I unit test class X, please explain.”&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;“Please help me create class X.”&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;“Where should I put class X, in which package?”&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;“Which library should I use for doing X?”&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;The project is &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/02/16/it-is-not-a-school.html&quot;&gt;not a school&lt;/a&gt;, it’s not interested in making you smarter or more of an expert in its code. Nobody will explain anything to &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt;, because it’s a waste of money and time. What the project will do instead is fix its code base so that it becomes cleaner and more obvious for you &lt;em&gt;and everybody else&lt;/em&gt;. Thus, never ask for explanation or help, ask for documentation and source code fixes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;You can blame everybody around you, but first of all you should blame the code base itself.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;What do you do next? You sit and wait, until those tickets are resolved. Who will resolve them? You don’t care. That’s a problem for the project manager. Maybe he/she will even assign those tickets back to you and it will be your problem to resolve them. But if that happens, the scope of work will be different for you. You won’t need to fix the bug anymore, you will have to document some functionality or refactor some module.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You will have other problems in this new and smaller scope. You will create new tickets, blaming everybody around you, and they also may come back to you. And so on and so forth. Ultimately, the scope of a ticket will be as small as it’s possible to fix in 30 minutes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;See the algorithm? I’m sure you do, but it’s very difficult to apply it to real life and real software projects, for a few obvious psychological reasons:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You are ashamed&lt;/strong&gt;. You are trained to feel guilty when you are not smart enough. What can I say? Just &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow0lr63y4Mw&quot;&gt;stop it&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You are a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfectionism_%28psychology%29&quot;&gt;perfectionist&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. You want to complete the entire ticket, solve the entire problem, and understand the entire scope. What can I say? This won’t be solved while the project continues to pay you &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/07/21/hourly-pay-modern-slavery.html&quot;&gt;by the hour/month&lt;/a&gt;. Once they start paying for results, this disease will be cured.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You have no passion&lt;/strong&gt;. You just don’t care about the quality of code at all. You don’t want it to look clean, you can’t even tell what clean is or what messy is. You just want them to pay you by the end of the month. In this case you won’t even know what tickets to report. What can I say? I guess you have to try and find another job. Maybe a &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/01/05/how-to-punish-employees.html&quot;&gt;manager&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You are afraid&lt;/strong&gt;. Blaming the project and reporting tickets may look like you have a negative attitude towards the code base, and people who created it, which is not true. Instead, your attitude is &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/04/13/bugs-are-welcome.html&quot;&gt;positive&lt;/a&gt;, since you care about it and want it to get better. What can I say? Make your tickets sound extremely polite and gentle. But keep reporting them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You have no time&lt;/strong&gt;. You have to solve the problem now and you have no time to wait for the resolution of those complaints you reported. What can I say? Blame the management and require more time. Much more time. But never blame yourself.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Software development is perfect territory for &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/01/15/how-to-cut-corners.html&quot;&gt;cutting corners&lt;/a&gt;, being lazy and remaining calm, because our work is often discrete and can be very incremental. Very occasionally it might not be possible to blame the project and put the ticket on pause until all your complaints are addressed. I can’t imagine such a situation though.

Here is how.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;!--more--&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;jb_picture&quot;&gt;&lt;img itemprop=&quot;image&quot; alt=&quot;Sin City (2005) by Frank Miller&quot; src=&quot;/images/2018/04/sin-city.jpg&quot; longdesc=&quot;#fcd454d6&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption id=&quot;fcd454d6&quot;&gt;Sin City (2005) by Frank Miller&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;I wrote about this a few years ago in this blog post: &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/01/15/how-to-cut-corners.html&quot;&gt;How to Cut Corners and Stay Cool&lt;/a&gt;. However, in &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.me/joinchat/CLxAaQ0xp-g_3WWI3MBr2g&quot;&gt;our Telegram group&lt;/a&gt;, where we talk about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zerocracy.com&quot;&gt;Zerocracy&lt;/a&gt;, some programmers keep asking me the same question over and over again: What should I do when the project is absolutely new to me, I have just &lt;a href=&quot;/2018/01/09/micro-budgeting.html&quot;&gt;30 minutes&lt;/a&gt;, and the bug is very complex?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;This literally means that you should always and only think about yourself and your personal profit.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;One of the core &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zerocracy.com/toc.html&quot;&gt;principles&lt;/a&gt; of Zerocracy is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXUwE3FGfpg&quot;&gt;#NoAltruism&lt;/a&gt;. This literally means that you should always and only think about yourself and your personal profit. You should not try to improve the project, to increase its quality, to fix the code, or to refactor anything… unless you are &lt;em&gt;paid&lt;/em&gt; for it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;First of all, when the task, which you are going to be paid for, is in front of you and you can’t understand how to solve it, &lt;em&gt;don’t&lt;/em&gt; blame yourself. You are not supposed to be an expert in the legacy code you just opened up. Strictly speaking, you are not supposed to be an expert in anything. A project, &lt;del&gt;unlike your mom&lt;/del&gt;, doesn’t expect you to be intelligent or tech-savvy. It needs you to &lt;a href=&quot;/2017/11/28/microtasking.html&quot;&gt;close tickets&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;youtube&quot;&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXUwE3FGfpg&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;box&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vXUwE3FGfpg/mqdefault.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;YouTube video #vXUwE3FGfpg&quot; /&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;play&quot;&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;icon icon-play&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;div&gt;#NoAltruism; 20 April 2018.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;Who do you blame, if not yourself, when the bug is serious, the code is messy, and you have no idea how much time it will take just to understand it, let alone fix it? Well, you can blame everybody around you, but first of all you should blame the code base itself. How do you blame it? You report its low quality by creating new tickets, which may sound like this:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;“The class X is not sufficiently documented, I don’t understand how it works.”&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;“The method X is too complex, I don’t know what it does.”&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;“The algorithm X is messy, I can’t figure out what it does.”&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;“The library X is used here, but I don’t understand why you don’t use library Y.”&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;“The rules of class naming are not clear, document them please.”&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;“The principle of data organization is not obvious, document it.”&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, don’t make the mistake many programmers are making when we tell them that tickets are the only &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/10/07/stop-chatting-start-coding.html&quot;&gt;right way&lt;/a&gt; to solve problems. They start asking questions and seeking help in the tickets, just like this:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;“How can I unit test class X, please explain.”&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;“Please help me create class X.”&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;“Where should I put class X, in which package?”&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;“Which library should I use for doing X?”&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;The project is &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/02/16/it-is-not-a-school.html&quot;&gt;not a school&lt;/a&gt;, it’s not interested in making you smarter or more of an expert in its code. Nobody will explain anything to &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt;, because it’s a waste of money and time. What the project will do instead is fix its code base so that it becomes cleaner and more obvious for you &lt;em&gt;and everybody else&lt;/em&gt;. Thus, never ask for explanation or help, ask for documentation and source code fixes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;You can blame everybody around you, but first of all you should blame the code base itself.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;What do you do next? You sit and wait, until those tickets are resolved. Who will resolve them? You don’t care. That’s a problem for the project manager. Maybe he/she will even assign those tickets back to you and it will be your problem to resolve them. But if that happens, the scope of work will be different for you. You won’t need to fix the bug anymore, you will have to document some functionality or refactor some module.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You will have other problems in this new and smaller scope. You will create new tickets, blaming everybody around you, and they also may come back to you. And so on and so forth. Ultimately, the scope of a ticket will be as small as it’s possible to fix in 30 minutes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;See the algorithm? I’m sure you do, but it’s very difficult to apply it to real life and real software projects, for a few obvious psychological reasons:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You are ashamed&lt;/strong&gt;. You are trained to feel guilty when you are not smart enough. What can I say? Just &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow0lr63y4Mw&quot;&gt;stop it&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You are a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfectionism_%28psychology%29&quot;&gt;perfectionist&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. You want to complete the entire ticket, solve the entire problem, and understand the entire scope. What can I say? This won’t be solved while the project continues to pay you &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/07/21/hourly-pay-modern-slavery.html&quot;&gt;by the hour/month&lt;/a&gt;. Once they start paying for results, this disease will be cured.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You have no passion&lt;/strong&gt;. You just don’t care about the quality of code at all. You don’t want it to look clean, you can’t even tell what clean is or what messy is. You just want them to pay you by the end of the month. In this case you won’t even know what tickets to report. What can I say? I guess you have to try and find another job. Maybe a &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/01/05/how-to-punish-employees.html&quot;&gt;manager&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You are afraid&lt;/strong&gt;. Blaming the project and reporting tickets may look like you have a negative attitude towards the code base, and people who created it, which is not true. Instead, your attitude is &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/04/13/bugs-are-welcome.html&quot;&gt;positive&lt;/a&gt;, since you care about it and want it to get better. What can I say? Make your tickets sound extremely polite and gentle. But keep reporting them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You have no time&lt;/strong&gt;. You have to solve the problem now and you have no time to wait for the resolution of those complaints you reported. What can I say? Blame the management and require more time. Much more time. But never blame yourself.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Software development is perfect territory for &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/01/15/how-to-cut-corners.html&quot;&gt;cutting corners&lt;/a&gt;, being lazy and remaining calm, because our work is often discrete and can be very incremental. Very occasionally it might not be possible to blame the project and put the ticket on pause until all your complaints are addressed. I can’t imagine such a situation though. If you can, please let me know.&lt;/p&gt; "/> <meta name="twitter:url" property="og:url" content="https://www.yegor256.com/2018/04/17/how-to-be-lazy.html"/> <meta name="telegram:channel"

The “deep thinking,” as <a href="https://twitter.com/yegor256/status/984759494918987776">they call it</a>, which is always required before even a small issue can be resolved, seriously turns me away from programming.

This literally means that you should always and only think about yourself and your personal profit. You should not try to improve the project, to increase its quality, to fix the code, or to refactor anything… unless you are <em>paid</em> for it.</p><p>First of all, when the task, which you are going to be paid for, is in front of you and you can’t understand how to solve it, <em>don’t</em> blame yourself. You are not supposed to be an expert in the legacy code you just opened up. Strictly speaking, you are not supposed to be an expert in anything. A project, <del>unlike your mom</del>, doesn’t expect you to be intelligent or tech-savvy. It needs you to <a href="/2017/11/28/microtasking.html">close tickets</a>.</p><aside class="youtube"> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXUwE3FGfpg"><div class="box"> <img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vXUwE3FGfpg/mqdefault.jpg" alt="YouTube video #vXUwE3FGfpg" /><div class="play"><i class="icon icon-play"></i></div></div></a><div>#NoAltruism; 20 April 2018.</div></aside><p>Who do you blame, if not yourself, when the bug is serious, the code is messy, and you have no idea how much time it will take just to understand it, let alone fix it? Well, you can blame everybody around you, but first of all you should blame the code base itself. How do you blame it? You report its low quality by creating new tickets, which may sound like this:</p><ul> <li>“The class X is not sufficiently documented, I don’t understand how it works.”</li> <li>“The method X is too complex, I don’t know what it does.”</li> <li>“The algorithm X is messy, I can’t figure out what it does.”</li> <li>“The library X is used here, but I don’t understand why you don’t use library Y.”</li> <li>“The rules of class naming are not clear, document them please.”</li> <li>“The principle of data organization is not obvious, document it.”</li></ul><p>However, don’t make the mistake many programmers are making when we tell them that tickets are the only <a href="/2014/10/07/stop-chatting-start-coding.html">right way</a> to solve problems. They start asking questions and seeking help in the tickets, just like this:</p><ul> <li>“How can I unit test class X, please explain.”</li> <li>“Please help me create class X.”</li> <li>“Where should I put class X, in which package?”</li> <li>“Which library should I use for doing X?”</li></ul><p>The project is <a href="/2015/02/16/it-is-not-a-school.html">not a school</a>, it’s not interested in making you smarter or more of an expert in its code. Nobody will explain anything to <em>you</em>, because it’s a waste of money and time. What the project will do instead is fix its code base so that it becomes cleaner and more obvious for you <em>and everybody else</em>. Thus, never ask for explanation or help, ask for documentation and source code fixes.</p><aside class="quote">You can blame everybody around you, but first of all you should blame the code base itself.</aside><p>What do you do next? You sit and wait, until those tickets are resolved. Who will resolve them? You don’t care. That’s a problem for the project manager. Maybe he/she will even assign those tickets back to you and it will be your problem to resolve them. But if that happens, the scope of work will be different for you. You won’t need to fix the bug anymore, you will have to document some functionality or refactor some module.</p><p>You will have other problems in this new and smaller scope. You will create new tickets, blaming everybody around you, and they also may come back to you. And so on and so forth. Ultimately, the scope of a ticket will be as small as it’s possible to fix in 30 minutes.</p><p>See the algorithm? I’m sure you do, but it’s very difficult to apply it to real life and real software projects, for a few obvious psychological reasons:</p><ul> <li><p><strong>You are ashamed</strong>. You are trained to feel guilty when you are not smart enough. What can I say? Just <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow0lr63y4Mw">stop it</a>!</p></li> <li><p><strong>You are a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfectionism_%28psychology%29">perfectionist</a></strong>. You want to complete the entire ticket, solve the entire problem, and understand the entire scope. What can I say? This won’t be solved while the project continues to pay you <a href="/2015/07/21/hourly-pay-modern-slavery.html">by the hour/month</a>. Once they start paying for results, this disease will be cured.</p></li> <li><p><strong>You have no passion</strong>. You just don’t care about the quality of code at all. You don’t want it to look clean, you can’t even tell what clean is or what messy is. You just want them to pay you by the end of the month. In this case you won’t even know what tickets to report. What can I say? I guess you have to try and find another job. Maybe a <a href="/2016/01/05/how-to-punish-employees.html">manager</a>?</p></li> <li><p><strong>You are afraid</strong>. Blaming the project and reporting tickets may look like you have a negative attitude towards the code base, and people who created it, which is not true. Instead, your attitude is <a href="/2014/04/13/bugs-are-welcome.html">positive</a>, since you care about it and want it to get better. What can I say? Make your tickets sound extremely polite and gentle. But keep reporting them.</p></li> <li><p><strong>You have no time</strong>. You have to solve the problem now and you have no time to wait for the resolution of those complaints you reported. What can I say? Blame the management and require more time. Much more time. But never blame yourself.</p></li></ul><p>Software development is perfect territory for <a href="/2015/01/15/how-to-cut-corners.html">cutting corners</a>, being lazy and remaining calm, because our work is often discrete and can be very incremental.

I wrote my first piece of code when I was 12. Since then I have been programming and managing other programmers, hiring and firing them, planning projects and their budgets, finding and losing customers, investing into software teams and losing my investments, even teaching others how to manage software projects. What is my overall impression? It’s a pain. I think I’ve found a solution though.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;!--more--&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;jb_picture&quot;&gt;&lt;img itemprop=&quot;image&quot; alt=&quot;Casino (1995) by Martin Scorsese&quot; src=&quot;/images/2018/03/casino.jpg&quot; longdesc=&quot;#23194099&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption id=&quot;23194099&quot;&gt;Casino (1995) by Martin Scorsese&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Software projects &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/05/21/avoid-software-outsourcing-disaster.html&quot;&gt;fail&lt;/a&gt;. Most of them, anyway. Miserably. They run out of money, they produce software that doesn’t work, they miss deadlines, they lose key people and fall apart, and so on. Why does it happen? Not because programmers are stupid, nor technologies immature, and not because hardware is unstable.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They fail &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.infoq.com/articles/software-failure-reasons&quot;&gt;because&lt;/a&gt; we don’t manage them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We miss important data, we lose track of events, we don’t pay attention to risks and threats, we don’t plan time and money, and we don’t do many other things that &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Management_Body_of_Knowledge&quot;&gt;PMBOK&lt;/a&gt; says we have to do in order to keep a project under control.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;youtube&quot;&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwrMKTFyohg&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;box&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AwrMKTFyohg/mqdefault.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;YouTube video #AwrMKTFyohg&quot; /&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;play&quot;&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;icon icon-play&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;div&gt;#NoMagic; 13 April 2018.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;What do we do instead?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We rely on our innate hierarchical instincts and hope for the best.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Here is what I mean by that. First, we put a group of people together, also known as programmers. Then, we tell them how &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/03/02/team-morale-myths-and-reality.html&quot;&gt;important&lt;/a&gt; the goal is that they are going to achieve—develop a software product.

If we are lucky.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is exactly how it has worked in the Animal Kingdom, for millions of years. In order to survive, mammals create hierarchies: the strongest males are on top, others do what they say. If they don’t obey, violence helps.

We, unlike the animals, don’t use physical violence anymore, at least not in the software business, but we have a huge arsenal of more sophisticated &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/01/05/how-to-punish-employees.html&quot;&gt;punishment methods&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They do work.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, due to the complexity of our profession, the quality and efficacy of the results we observe are very low. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.projectsmart.co.uk/white-papers/chaos-report.pdf&quot;&gt;CHAOS Report&lt;/a&gt; (2015) by the Standish Group says that “software development projects are in chaos, and we can no longer imitate the three monkeys—hear no failures, see no failures, speak no failures.” The report also demonstrates that as a result of this chaos we have restarts (94% projects!), cost overruns, and time overruns. The report also says that technology incompetence is the root cause of project failures only in 7% cases. In almost all other cases the management is the source of the trouble.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;badge&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zerocracy.com&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;//www.0crat.com/svg/logo.svg&quot; style=&quot;width:100px;max-width:100%;&quot; alt=&quot;badge&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;We, at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zerocracy.com&quot;&gt;Zerocracy&lt;/a&gt;, believe that in the 21st century programmers (and not only them) deserve a better and a more effective replacement for this “monkey management.” We believe that the software development world needs a management model which is based on people’s professional merits, instead of on their ability to play the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_%28ethology%29&quot;&gt;alpha/beta&lt;/a&gt; games.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;badge&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.0crat.com&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.0crat.com/svg/zerocrat.svg&quot; style=&quot;width:100px;max-width:100%;&quot; alt=&quot;badge&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Zerocracy offers exactly that: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.0crat.com&quot;&gt;Zerocrat&lt;/a&gt;, an automated project manager, which communicates as a chat bot and tells programmers what to do.

It does all the routine jobs a professional &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/05/24/who-is-project-manager.html&quot;&gt;project manager&lt;/a&gt; should do on any project, but rarely does do because it’s so boring.

It also doesn’t know anything about hierarchies. It manages programmers only by their merits, which are visible via &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.0crat.com/team&quot;&gt;objective metrics&lt;/a&gt;.

Also, they boost the motivation of &lt;a href=&quot;/2018/01/09/micro-budgeting.html&quot;&gt;the type of programmers&lt;/a&gt;, who like the idea of being their own bosses.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;How many of those people are out there on the market—the future will soon show us.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Speaking philosophically, while it’s a common &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/quora/2017/12/18/artificial-intelligence-will-change-the-job-landscape-forever-heres-how-to-prepare/&quot;&gt;belief&lt;/a&gt; that in the future AI-powered robots will do what we want, we believe in the opposite: Robots will tell us what to do. Management is what computers do better, while writing code, drawing diagrams, growing flowers, or cooking a soup is what we, humans, do better and actually enjoy doing. We believe that in the future computers will help us organize ourselves by taking the routine part of the management on themselves.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Zerocracy makes the first step in this direction.&lt;/p&gt; " /> <meta name="keywords" content="next, path, output, content, previous, url, relative_path, id, collection, excerpt, draft, categories, layout, title, date, place, tags, description, keywords, image, jb_picture, slug, ext" /> <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1"/> <meta name="google-site-verification" content="JEj_gQr2CPe2QKGw8XdMz0R7VboQIUbX3FlM-lwTq-8" /> <meta name="author" content="Yegor Bugayenko"> <meta name="article:published_time" content="2018-03-21 00:00:00 +0000"> <meta name="og:site_name" content="Yegor Bugayenko"/> <meta name="og:type" content="article" /> <meta name="og:locale" content="en_US" /> <meta name="twitter:account_id" content="4503599630178231" /> <meta name="twitter:creator" content="@yegor256"/> <meta name="twitter:site" content="@yegor256"/> <meta name="twitter:title" property="og:title" content="Zerocracy: A Project Manager That Never Sleeps"/> <meta name="twitter:description" property="og:description" content="&lt;p&gt;I’ve been in the software business for almost 30 years.

Instead of cash, startups give their early employees &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock#Shares&quot;&gt;shares of stock&lt;/a&gt;, which they will be able to either 1) sell in a few years and become &lt;del&gt;millionaires&lt;/del&gt; billionaires, or 2) throw away and remain nobodies. It’s a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.quora.com/Do-founders-vest/answer/Charlie-Cheever&quot;&gt;common practice&lt;/a&gt;. The question, however, is what is the right procedure, and the optimal algorithm, to transfer those shares to programmers. When exactly do they become shareholders? What is the formula?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;!--more--&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;jb_picture&quot;&gt;&lt;img itemprop=&quot;image&quot; alt=&quot;La comunidad (2000) by Álex de la Iglesia&quot; src=&quot;/images/2018/02/la-comunidad.jpg&quot; longdesc=&quot;#c6f3e007&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption id=&quot;c6f3e007&quot;&gt;La comunidad (2000) by Álex de la Iglesia&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are a few typical approaches.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One of the most &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.feld.com/archives/2005/05/term-sheet-vesting.html&quot;&gt;popular&lt;/a&gt; is “&lt;a href=&quot;https://thenextweb.com/entrepreneur/2013/07/21/startup-founders-heres-why-vesting-is-your-best-friend/&quot;&gt;four years with a one-year cliff&lt;/a&gt;,” which means that if they had 50% equity and leave after two years they will only retain 25%. The longer they stay, the larger the percentage of their equity that will be vested until they become fully vested in the 48th month. However, because they have a one year cliff, if they leave before the 12th month, they get nothing. There could be &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@ipaullee/let-s-revise-the-vesting-schedule-for-startup-founders-and-employees-7817fcb301ea&quot;&gt;slight modifications&lt;/a&gt; to the numbers, of course.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Most vesting formulas are perfectly aligned with the popular &quot;be nice&quot; paradigm and is not beneficial, either to the company or to its slaves.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;The disadvantage of this approach is that their primary motivation is to stay in the company, instead of achieving results. This vesting formula is perfectly aligned with the popular &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/10/06/how-to-be-good-office-slave.html&quot;&gt;be nice&lt;/a&gt; paradigm and is not beneficial, either to the company or to its &lt;del&gt;slaves&lt;/del&gt; employees.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Another option is &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2015/12/09/milestone-based-vesting-for-startup-founders/&quot;&gt;milestone-based&lt;/a&gt; vesting, which defines a set of value milestones, each of which unlocks an additional part of the programmer’s equity.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On top of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/swlh/why-milestone-based-agreements-are-bad-for-early-stage-startups-15c759995121&quot;&gt;inability&lt;/a&gt; to predict milestones accurately, this vesting formula promotes group responsibility, which, in my opinion, is &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/11/21/ringelmann-effect-vs-agile.html&quot;&gt;the least&lt;/a&gt; effective way to motivate. Programmers writing Java classes can’t be responsible for the “next round of VC funding,” simply because they don’t have any idea how to make that round happen. It’s not their job, not their responsibility.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You may say that writing those Java classes is exactly how we make the next round happen, but it’s far from being true, in most cases. We all know that investments come to those who can &lt;del&gt;fool&lt;/del&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/03/28/unspoken-secrets-of-elevator-pitch.html&quot;&gt;pitch&lt;/a&gt; an investor, not to those who write the best Java code. Thus, the work programmers do and the “value events” the startup is aiming to reach are pretty much disconnected.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Using microvesting with valuation and hourly rate the company can influence programmers' motivation.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;A more logical formula is &lt;em&gt;microvesting&lt;/em&gt;, which we practice in projects managed by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zerocracy.com&quot;&gt;Zerocracy&lt;/a&gt;. It is as simple as that: A company has a valuation, which is set by its founders; let’s say, it’s $1,000,000. A programmer has an hourly rate, say, $40. Thus, when a &lt;a href=&quot;/2017/11/28/microtasking.html&quot;&gt;one-hour&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;/2018/01/09/micro-budgeting.html&quot;&gt;fixed-budget&lt;/a&gt; task is completed, the programmer earns 0.004% of equity ($40 / $1,000,000).

The longer they stay, the larger the percentage of their equity that will be vested until they become fully vested in the 48th month. However, because they have a one year cliff, if they leave before the 12th month, they get nothing. There could be &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@ipaullee/let-s-revise-the-vesting-schedule-for-startup-founders-and-employees-7817fcb301ea&quot;&gt;slight modifications&lt;/a&gt; to the numbers, of course.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Most vesting formulas are perfectly aligned with the popular &quot;be nice&quot; paradigm and is not beneficial, either to the company or to its slaves.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;The disadvantage of this approach is that their primary motivation is to stay in the company, instead of achieving results. This vesting formula is perfectly aligned with the popular &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/10/06/how-to-be-good-office-slave.html&quot;&gt;be nice&lt;/a&gt; paradigm and is not beneficial, either to the company or to its &lt;del&gt;slaves&lt;/del&gt; employees.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Another option is &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2015/12/09/milestone-based-vesting-for-startup-founders/&quot;&gt;milestone-based&lt;/a&gt; vesting, which defines a set of value milestones, each of which unlocks an additional part of the programmer’s equity.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On top of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/swlh/why-milestone-based-agreements-are-bad-for-early-stage-startups-15c759995121&quot;&gt;inability&lt;/a&gt; to predict milestones accurately, this vesting formula promotes group responsibility, which, in my opinion, is &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/11/21/ringelmann-effect-vs-agile.html&quot;&gt;the least&lt;/a&gt; effective way to motivate. Programmers writing Java classes can’t be responsible for the “next round of VC funding,” simply because they don’t have any idea how to make that round happen. It’s not their job, not their responsibility.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You may say that writing those Java classes is exactly how we make the next round happen, but it’s far from being true, in most cases. We all know that investments come to those who can &lt;del&gt;fool&lt;/del&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/03/28/unspoken-secrets-of-elevator-pitch.html&quot;&gt;pitch&lt;/a&gt; an investor, not to those who write the best Java code. Thus, the work programmers do and the “value events” the startup is aiming to reach are pretty much disconnected.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Using microvesting with valuation and hourly rate the company can influence programmers' motivation.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;A more logical formula is &lt;em&gt;microvesting&lt;/em&gt;, which we practice in projects managed by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zerocracy.com&quot;&gt;Zerocracy&lt;/a&gt;. It is as simple as that: A company has a valuation, which is set by its founders; let’s say, it’s $1,000,000. A programmer has an hourly rate, say, $40. Thus, when a &lt;a href=&quot;/2017/11/28/microtasking.html&quot;&gt;one-hour&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;/2018/01/09/micro-budgeting.html&quot;&gt;fixed-budget&lt;/a&gt; task is completed, the programmer earns 0.004% of equity ($40 / $1,000,000).

It is as simple as that: A company has a valuation, which is set by its founders; let’s say, it’s $1,000,000. A programmer has an hourly rate, say, $40. Thus, when a <a href="/2017/11/28/microtasking.html">one-hour</a> <a href="/2018/01/09/micro-budgeting.html">fixed-budget</a> task is completed, the programmer earns 0.004% of equity ($40 / $1,000,000). Our software calculates it all automatically, increasing their shares after each completed task.</p><p>Using these two variables—valuation and hourly rate—the company can influence programmers’ motivation.</p><p>No need to <a href="/2015/03/02/team-morale-myths-and-reality.html">lie</a> to them about big-money milestones or keep them in the office for four years.

I &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/09/24/why-monetary-awards-dont-work.html&quot;&gt;believe&lt;/a&gt; that the best reward and punishment instrument is money. The budget is fixed, the programmer gets it only when the task is completed (reward), no matter how much time it cost; if it is not completed, there is no money at all (punishment). Pure and simple. However, a logical question arises: how can we know upfront what is the right budget? Who sets it?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;!--more--&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;jb_picture&quot;&gt;&lt;img itemprop=&quot;image&quot; alt=&quot;Taxi Driver (1976) by Martin Scorsese&quot; src=&quot;/images/2018/01/taxi-driver.jpg&quot; longdesc=&quot;#1d81308e&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption id=&quot;1d81308e&quot;&gt;Taxi Driver (1976) by Martin Scorsese&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;When we started to play with microtasking in our projects, in 2009, we were asking programmers to estimate each task. It did work, but only with very simple and obvious tasks. More complex ones almost always suffered from either under-estimating or padding—numbers were either very small and task performers were complaining in the end, or they were too big and customers were asking for refunds. It was not a manageable situation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Then, we realized that it would be better if all tasks were rather small, with exactly the same budget. We tried to use two hours as a universal and fixed estimate. Everything else that didn’t fit—programmers were allowed to reject. This model didn’t really work either, because our managers had to deal with a very large amount of rejected tasks and didn’t know how to make them smaller, since they were not programmers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;The beauty of this approach is that the task of scope decomposition is moved to the shoulders of programmers.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;Finally, in March 2010 we found a solution, which was labeled &lt;a href=&quot;/2010/03/04/pdd.html&quot;&gt;Puzzle Driven Development&lt;/a&gt; (PDD). According to this concept: 1) Any task has a very small fixed budget (we use 30 minutes); 2) The task performer is allowed to complete only part of the task; 3) The code that is being returned to &lt;code&gt;master&lt;/code&gt; must include &lt;code&gt;@todo&lt;/code&gt; markers, called “puzzles”; 4) Puzzles are automatically converted to new tasks.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The beauty of this approach is that the most complicated part of the software project management—scope decomposition—is moved to the shoulders of those who are the best at it: programmers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We are using PDD in all our projects now and have even created a public instrument for GitHub repositories, which allows anyone to play with PDD at no cost: &lt;a href=&quot;/2017/04/05/pdd-in-action.html&quot;&gt;0pdd.com&lt;/a&gt;. This is exactly the same tool we are using in our commercial projects.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, if and when you decide to apply microbudgeting to your project, together with PDD, there will be problems. Psychological ones mostly. In my experience, people go through five stages when they face microbudgeting for the first time:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Denial&lt;/strong&gt;. They ask “How is it possible?” and then refuse to hear any explanations. There are many reasons why microbudgeting and microtasking may not work—you will hear them all. Very often they demand a traditional model of payment, especially if they were invited. They just say that our model is insane, and if we want to see them work on our projects we have to pay for as much time as they spend. Most of them quit.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anger&lt;/strong&gt;. Some of them decide to try. Thanks to their previous multi-year experience, they expect to be paid by the end of the day/week/month, no matter what they were doing. Very soon they realize that the total income for the first day of work was $0.00, even though they were doing something. They get very angry. They call us crooks, fraudsters, and many other names. Asking them to read the &lt;a href=&quot;http://datum.zerocracy.com/pages/policy.html&quot;&gt;policy&lt;/a&gt; again doesn’t help. They simply can’t believe that we are not going to pay them anything, even though they were doing something. Most of them quit.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bargaining&lt;/strong&gt;. Almost everybody at this stage recommends we change the model. They explain why it’s not really effective and how great it would be if we would pay them the traditional way. They give us examples of their previous projects, send references from previous employees, and criticize my blog posts. With some of them I try to argue, when their criticism is constructive. Most of them quit.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Depression&lt;/strong&gt;. Most programmers are used to doing work because they feel guilty if the task is not done or the bug is not fixed. Microbudgeting requires a completely opposite attitude: we all are supposed to work because we are greedy. Money has to motivate us, not guilt. If there is no money, we don’t work. Most people, when they see this new motivational paradigm and don’t see the usual guilt, lose coordination and don’t know what to do. They can’t really achieve anything, because there is no traditional manager standing behind them and pushing them forward. They are supposed to go for the money. They don’t, and so they don’t make any money. Most of them quit.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Acceptance&lt;/strong&gt;. Finally, the best of them realize that the model can work if they follow the rules, which are very simple: be greedy, selfish, egoistic, money-driven, result-oriented, lazy, misanthropic, heartless, and arrogant. They accept the fact that they lose, compete, work, and make money only when they produce results. They start enjoying meritocracy at its best.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;You understand already that the vast majority of those who try to work with us can’t really get to the final point—they quit somewhere in the middle. Most probably something very similar will happen on your projects too.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What is the solution? I don’t really know.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Statistically speaking, three to five people out of a hundred manage to survive and become effective and productive. Thus, to build a team of twenty people you will have to screen and try at least 400.&lt;/p&gt; " /> <meta name="keywords" content="next, path, output, content, previous, url, relative_path, id, collection, excerpt, draft, categories, layout, title, date, place, tags, description, keywords, image, jb_picture, buffer, slug, ext" /> <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1"/> <meta name="google-site-verification" content="JEj_gQr2CPe2QKGw8XdMz0R7VboQIUbX3FlM-lwTq-8" /> <meta name="author" content="Yegor Bugayenko"> <meta name="article:published_time" content="2018-01-09 00:00:00 +0000"> <meta name="og:site_name" content="Yegor Bugayenko"/> <meta name="og:type" content="article" /> <meta name="og:locale" content="en_US" /> <meta name="twitter:account_id" content="4503599630178231" /> <meta name="twitter:creator" content="@yegor256"/> <meta name="twitter:site" content="@yegor256"/> <meta name="twitter:title" property="og:title" content="Five Stages of Microbudgeting"/> <meta name="twitter:description" property="og:description" content="&lt;p&gt;Microtasking, which &lt;a href=&quot;/2017/11/28/microtasking.html&quot;&gt;I explained&lt;/a&gt; in an earlier post, works only when each task has a very specific reward for success and a punishment for failure.

Keeping us busy is the key objective of these creatures and this is what makes them so annoying.

You hire a group of people and give them all your money up front. They ask you to come back in two months, when everything will be ready. You say “OK” and wait for two months. I’m sure you already know what I’m getting at—this project most probably will be a failure, to some extent. In the worst case you won’t see these guys ever, they will just steal your money. In the best case, they will do something that will look “nice,” but not as nice as you expected.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;why-do-we-micromanage&quot;&gt;Why do we micromanage?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;What do you do in order to increase your chances of getting the best case scenario? That’s right, you micromanage them: you visit them every day, you ask them the famous “What are you doing now?” question, you push them when they are getting lazy, you control, you dominate, you annoy, you “stay on top,” you play the guilt card when they miss or forget, you &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/01/05/how-to-punish-employees.html&quot;&gt;punish&lt;/a&gt; them every way you can.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;The more aggressive you are, the higher the chances you win.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;You don’t do that because you’re evil. You just know that otherwise they will trash your apartment, will forget things, will miss something, will make mistakes, will spend more time and money than they are supposed to, will choose wrong fabrics, will purchase the furniture you don’t like, and will do many other things you’re well aware of if you’ve ever dealt with interior designers and house builders.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The more aggressive you are, the higher the chances you win.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And it’s not because you are evil. You’re not evil, you’re stupid (not you personally, my dear and respected reader, but you get the point).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;youtube&quot;&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhDmHkMAYnM&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;box&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uhDmHkMAYnM/mqdefault.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;YouTube video #uhDmHkMAYnM&quot; /&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;play&quot;&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;icon icon-play&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;div&gt;Micro-management vs. micro-tasking (webinar #25); 7 June 2017.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;The problem is that the project is not manageable. That’s why you have to resort to the last possible measure—micromanagement. Why is the project not manageable? Because its scope is not broken down into pieces. It contains a large single job called “Redesign The Apartment.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One of the key success factors for manageability is the famous 0/100 rule, which requires any task to be either “in progress” or “complete.” There can be nothing in the middle. When such a rule is in place, the task can be delegated to its performer and they can become responsible for its completion, they can be trusted.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We can’t “trust” our single large task to the performer, simply because it’s too big to be trusted. If they fail, the cost of failure will be too high. We have to take a &lt;em&gt;micro&lt;/em&gt;-scope and get into the task to manage it from the inside, annoying its performers, whom we are supposed to trust. The micromanagement we do is &lt;em&gt;inevitable&lt;/em&gt;, because the scope is not broken down.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scope decomposition was invented mostly in order to solve this very problem: to make the project more manageable. We need small tasks in the scope in order to be able to delegate them and never go inside in order to check what’s going on there, who is doing what, why, and where.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The smaller the tasks we can break the scope into, the better.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;how-small-can-tasks-be&quot;&gt;How small can tasks be?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;In our projects we break project scope into tasks of 30 minutes each. This may sound too extreme for you, but it works for us. We call them micro-tasks. We started to practice micro-tasking about seven years ago. We experimented with different task sizes, from 10 hours to 15 minutes, but eventually came down to 30 minutes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When tasks are bigger, we lose the manageability and simply get back to macro-tasking. When tasks are smaller, the context switching overhead becomes too annoying.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In our experience, a senior programmer, if fully dedicated to a project, completes 6-10 tasks a day. This means that they spend 3-5 hours working, while the rest of the time is spent on doing something else. This is a much more effective use of work time than we can achieve with traditional macro-tasking management, where programmers barely work for two hours a day, spending the rest of their time on something else (my personal observation).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;what-obstacles-did-we-have&quot;&gt;What obstacles did we have?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you decide to go for micro-tasking, you will most likely have the same or similar obstacles that we’ve had. Here is a short list of them and my advice, which may help if one day you decide to break a “Develop a Mobile App” task into, say, 2,500+ micro tasks:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vagueness&lt;/strong&gt;. Definition of done, exit criteria, requirements, expectations—there are many names, which are all about our inability to define what exactly we expect programmers to do. Software development by definition includes a lot of unknowns, creativity, experiments, and risks. Programmers will tell you that they can’t guarantee anything in most cases, and can’t really give any valid promises. We solve that by &lt;a href=&quot;/2010/03/04/pdd.html&quot;&gt;PDD&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Distraction&lt;/strong&gt;. Programmers are used to doing many different things at the same time: they write code, help others, watch YouTube, scroll Facebook, swear at Reddit, and read my blog. Initially most of them won’t like the idea of having explicit tasks in front of them, simply because they put a structure on their work time, making it much more visible to the management. They will tell you that they have many other things to do aside from your bloody tasks. We solve that by &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/04/17/how-xdsd-is-different.html&quot;&gt;paying by result&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/10/07/stop-chatting-start-coding.html&quot;&gt;prohibition of chitchats&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;They are simply spoiled by the traditional macro-tasking where they are paid by the month and nobody really controls their results.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Laziness&lt;/strong&gt;. Just like that apartment designers, programmers also love to get paid and do nothing. Who doesn’t, right? They will tell you that their work is more complicated than you think, that they need much more time, that they need to investigate the problem first, that reading documentation also takes a lot of time, etc. They are simply spoiled by the &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/10/06/how-to-be-good-office-slave.html&quot;&gt;traditional macro-tasking&lt;/a&gt; where they are paid by the month and nobody really controls their results. They are used to being &lt;del&gt;office slaves&lt;/del&gt; lazy. We solve that by &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/04/17/how-xdsd-is-different.html&quot;&gt;paying by result&lt;/a&gt; and the lazy ones simply quit.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Responsibility&lt;/strong&gt;. Micro-tasking will make individual results visible. When tasks are large people tend to work with them in groups and it’s unclear exactly who is responsible for failures and successes. Smaller tasks emphasize mistakes and make people “pay” for them. Not necessarily with cash, but definitely some way or other. Most programmers will find this concept very new and disturbing—they’ve almost never paid for their own mistakes before and never had their own tasks. The responsibility was always spread across the group. We solve that by &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/09/24/why-monetary-awards-dont-work.html&quot;&gt;monetary rewards and punishments&lt;/a&gt;, which make them very motivated and failure-ready.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Resentment&lt;/strong&gt;. This is one of the most popular and the most annoying of problems: they will tell you that they are “not monkeys.” They will actually combine all problems listed above and say that the right way to solve them is to give programmers freedom and let them do their job, since they are smart enough and don’t need any management from the top. And they will mostly be saying it quite honestly, with no intent to manipulate. The thing is that they are used to macro-tasking and believe that this is the only and the right way. I’m trying to solve this by writing this very blog post.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;There could be something else, but this is a more or less an exhaustive list of the problems we were faced with.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;where-micro-tasking-didnt-work&quot;&gt;Where micro-tasking didn’t work&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Obviously, any approach has its pros and cons. Micro-tasking seems to be the most effective management paradigm for us. However, it’s not applicable everywhere, according to our experience. There are territories where we failed to apply it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prototyping&lt;/strong&gt;. Every project or a new big feature starts with a prototype, which requires one or two people sitting next to each other, thinking, and experimenting. We tried to break this piece of work into smaller parts, but failed. It &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/10/06/software-project-lifecycle.html&quot;&gt;seems&lt;/a&gt; that this process has to be done as a single solid work package.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UI/UX&lt;/strong&gt;. We were mostly working with server-side Java/Ruby/C++ projects for the last few years and didn’t have many opportunities to apply micro-tasking to the UI/UX jobs. However, whatever we did try never really worked: graphic designers weren’t able to decompose their tasks into smaller parts.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Customers&lt;/strong&gt;. We &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/04/26/incremental-requirements-with-requs.html&quot;&gt;tried&lt;/a&gt; to decompose the task of eliciting requirements from our clients and failed a few times. Maybe our clients were stupid (I doubt that), maybe requirements were too complex, or maybe our system analysts were not professional enough. The bottom line is that we realized that such a task must be done as a solid piece of work, without any decomposition.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fire-fighting&lt;/strong&gt;. When the speed of delivery is the most important concern, micro-tasking doesn’t work for us. The overhead for dispatching and specifying tasks was taking too much time. When something is really urgent, we have to do the traditional macro-tasking and just “make it work.” Then we get back to micro-tasking.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Everything else, including programming, unit testing, manual testing, performance/load testing, integration testing, deployment, code review, documentation, and even training, can and must be managed via micro tasks.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;what-benefits-do-we-get&quot;&gt;What benefits do we get?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The most important benefit of micro-tasking is that the project becomes more manageable, as was mentioned above. Here is a more detailed break down:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Money works&lt;/strong&gt;. When tasks are very small, we can use &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/09/24/why-monetary-awards-dont-work.html&quot;&gt;good old dollar bills&lt;/a&gt; to motivate programmers. We can throw away literally &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/03/02/team-morale-myths-and-reality.html&quot;&gt;all other&lt;/a&gt; instruments.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We pay less&lt;/strong&gt;. We seriously lower our expenses, even though hourly rates of our programmers are &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/10/29/how-much-do-you-cost.html&quot;&gt;higher&lt;/a&gt; than many other projects can afford. I did a more or less &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/04/11/cost-of-loc.html&quot;&gt;detailed analysis&lt;/a&gt; a few years ago, which demonstrated that our projects were 30 (!) times more cost efficient than traditional ones.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Motivation is high&lt;/strong&gt;. Despite a very common stereotype that small and isolated tasks demotivate their performers, we see quite the opposite reaction: programmers are excited when it finally becomes possible to work within well-defined and explicit boundaries, independently, and in isolation. Not all of them, &lt;a href=&quot;/2018/01/09/micro-budgeting.html&quot;&gt;though&lt;/a&gt;. My personal observation is: only 25% of them can understand and enjoy micro-tasking. Others are either not professional enough or spoiled by &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/10/06/how-to-be-good-office-slave.html&quot;&gt;office slavery&lt;/a&gt;, where it’s possible to do almost nothing and stay very respected and well rewarded.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Turnover is not painful&lt;/strong&gt;. To make micro-tasking possible the management has to learn how to specify them: explicitly, unambiguously, and fast. When such a high level of transparency, formality, and agility (at the same time) is achieved, the project becomes less dependent on &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/12/29/turnover-is-good-for-maintainability.html&quot;&gt;experts&lt;/a&gt;. We lose the fear of losing people, because almost everything we need to know about the project is inside our task tracking system and project documentation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Easier to parallel&lt;/strong&gt;. Smaller tasks are easier to delegate to a larger amount of programmers. In some projects we sometimes have over 40 programmers at the same time, while the amount of tasks is relatively small (up to 200).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Metrics work&lt;/strong&gt;. When one programmer closes 40-50 tasks per week and another one closes 5-10, it does mean something, keeping in mind that all tasks are almost equal in size. We use this metric (and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.0crat.com/gang&quot;&gt;a few others&lt;/a&gt;) to make organizational and discipline decisions. In a macro-tasking environment almost no HR metrics really work.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quality is enforceable&lt;/strong&gt;. Large amounts of small tasks implies that we constantly and frequently close them. Each closure is an important point for quality control. That’s exactly where we have the ability to say “No” and reject the deliverables that violate our quality standards. With big tasks this “No” is much more painful for programmers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Risks are acceptable&lt;/strong&gt;. It’s impossible to accept the risk of the entire apartment redesign failure, since its cost is too high—a few thousand dollars. However, it is absolutely affordable to accept a risk of a kitchen lamp installation. Even if it falls and breaks, we will spend a few dollars and buy a new one. We don’t need to control the “lamp person”—we have a luxury to delegate and trust.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;The benefits programmers get overlap with our benefits. If they are professional and motivated enough they find it effective and productive to work with micro tasks, which are always well defined and properly paid.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;are-we-monkeys-or-not&quot;&gt;Are we monkeys or not?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now the most typical complaint we hear about micro-tasking is: “It is for junior programmers who are OK with being code monkeys.” To be honest, I also thought so a few years ago, when we started to experiment with &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/04/17/how-xdsd-is-different.html&quot;&gt;XDSD&lt;/a&gt;. What I quickly found out is that the most professional and self-motivated developers were enjoying micro-tasking, while their less mature and less skilled colleagues were finding it difficult to keep up.&lt;/p&gt; " /> <meta name="keywords" content="next, path, output, content, previous, url, relative_path, id, collection, excerpt, draft, categories, layout, title, date, place, tags, description, keywords, image, jb_picture, buffer, slug, ext" /> <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1"/> <meta name="google-site-verification" content="JEj_gQr2CPe2QKGw8XdMz0R7VboQIUbX3FlM-lwTq-8" /> <meta name="author" content="Yegor Bugayenko"> <meta name="article:published_time" content="2017-11-28 00:00:00 +0000"> <meta name="og:site_name" content="Yegor Bugayenko"/> <meta name="og:type" content="article" /> <meta name="og:locale" content="en_US" /> <meta name="twitter:account_id" content="4503599630178231" /> <meta name="twitter:creator" content="@yegor256"/> <meta name="twitter:site" content="@yegor256"/> <meta name="twitter:title" property="og:title" content="How Micro Is Your Tasking?"/> <meta name="twitter:description" property="og:description" content="&lt;p&gt;“What are you doing now?”—when you hear this question from your boss, be aware: you’re dealing with a &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/09/22/micromanagement.html&quot;&gt;micromanager&lt;/a&gt;. Keeping us busy is the key objective of these creatures and this is what makes them so annoying. To the contrary, &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/05/24/who-is-project-manager.html&quot;&gt;effective managers&lt;/a&gt; make sure we are &lt;em&gt;productive&lt;/em&gt;, meaning that our results satisfy their expectations. They are not interested in knowing what we are doing to deliver them—they manage the project, instead of managing us. And the first step to making the project manageable is to decompose its scope into smaller pieces.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;!--more--&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;jb_picture&quot;&gt;&lt;img itemprop=&quot;image&quot; alt=&quot;Carlito&amp;#39;s Way (1993) by Brian De Palma&quot; src=&quot;/images/2017/11/carlitos-way.jpg&quot; longdesc=&quot;#fa318a0d&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption id=&quot;fa318a0d&quot;&gt;Carlito&amp;#39;s Way (1993) by Brian De Palma&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Imagine you want to re-design your apartment, having a few thousand dollars for this job. You hire a group of people and give them all your money up front. They ask you to come back in two months, when everything will be ready. You say “OK” and wait for two months. I’m sure you already know what I’m getting at—this project most probably will be a failure, to some extent. In the worst case you won’t see these guys ever, they will just steal your money. In the best case, they will do something that will look “nice,” but not as nice as you expected.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;why-do-we-micromanage&quot;&gt;Why do we micromanage?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;What do you do in order to increase your chances of getting the best case scenario? That’s right, you micromanage them: you visit them every day, you ask them the famous “What are you doing now?” question, you push them when they are getting lazy, you control, you dominate, you annoy, you “stay on top,” you play the guilt card when they miss or forget, you &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/01/05/how-to-punish-employees.html&quot;&gt;punish&lt;/a&gt; them every way you can.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;The more aggressive you are, the higher the chances you win.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;You don’t do that because you’re evil. You just know that otherwise they will trash your apartment, will forget things, will miss something, will make mistakes, will spend more time and money than they are supposed to, will choose wrong fabrics, will purchase the furniture you don’t like, and will do many other things you’re well aware of if you’ve ever dealt with interior designers and house builders.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The more aggressive you are, the higher the chances you win.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And it’s not because you are evil. You’re not evil, you’re stupid (not you personally, my dear and respected reader, but you get the point).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;youtube&quot;&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhDmHkMAYnM&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;box&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uhDmHkMAYnM/mqdefault.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;YouTube video #uhDmHkMAYnM&quot; /&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;play&quot;&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;icon icon-play&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;div&gt;Micro-management vs. micro-tasking (webinar #25); 7 June 2017.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;The problem is that the project is not manageable. That’s why you have to resort to the last possible measure—micromanagement. Why is the project not manageable? Because its scope is not broken down into pieces. It contains a large single job called “Redesign The Apartment.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One of the key success factors for manageability is the famous 0/100 rule, which requires any task to be either “in progress” or “complete.” There can be nothing in the middle. When such a rule is in place, the task can be delegated to its performer and they can become responsible for its completion, they can be trusted.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We can’t “trust” our single large task to the performer, simply because it’s too big to be trusted. If they fail, the cost of failure will be too high. We have to take a &lt;em&gt;micro&lt;/em&gt;-scope and get into the task to manage it from the inside, annoying its performers, whom we are supposed to trust. The micromanagement we do is &lt;em&gt;inevitable&lt;/em&gt;, because the scope is not broken down.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scope decomposition was invented mostly in order to solve this very problem: to make the project more manageable. We need small tasks in the scope in order to be able to delegate them and never go inside in order to check what’s going on there, who is doing what, why, and where.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The smaller the tasks we can break the scope into, the better.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;how-small-can-tasks-be&quot;&gt;How small can tasks be?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;In our projects we break project scope into tasks of 30 minutes each. This may sound too extreme for you, but it works for us. We call them micro-tasks. We started to practice micro-tasking about seven years ago. We experimented with different task sizes, from 10 hours to 15 minutes, but eventually came down to 30 minutes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When tasks are bigger, we lose the manageability and simply get back to macro-tasking. When tasks are smaller, the context switching overhead becomes too annoying.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In our experience, a senior programmer, if fully dedicated to a project, completes 6-10 tasks a day. This means that they spend 3-5 hours working, while the rest of the time is spent on doing something else. This is a much more effective use of work time than we can achieve with traditional macro-tasking management, where programmers barely work for two hours a day, spending the rest of their time on something else (my personal observation).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;what-obstacles-did-we-have&quot;&gt;What obstacles did we have?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you decide to go for micro-tasking, you will most likely have the same or similar obstacles that we’ve had. Here is a short list of them and my advice, which may help if one day you decide to break a “Develop a Mobile App” task into, say, 2,500+ micro tasks:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vagueness&lt;/strong&gt;. Definition of done, exit criteria, requirements, expectations—there are many names, which are all about our inability to define what exactly we expect programmers to do. Software development by definition includes a lot of unknowns, creativity, experiments, and risks. Programmers will tell you that they can’t guarantee anything in most cases, and can’t really give any valid promises. We solve that by &lt;a href=&quot;/2010/03/04/pdd.html&quot;&gt;PDD&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Distraction&lt;/strong&gt;. Programmers are used to doing many different things at the same time: they write code, help others, watch YouTube, scroll Facebook, swear at Reddit, and read my blog. Initially most of them won’t like the idea of having explicit tasks in front of them, simply because they put a structure on their work time, making it much more visible to the management. They will tell you that they have many other things to do aside from your bloody tasks. We solve that by &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/04/17/how-xdsd-is-different.html&quot;&gt;paying by result&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/10/07/stop-chatting-start-coding.html&quot;&gt;prohibition of chitchats&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;aside class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;They are simply spoiled by the traditional macro-tasking where they are paid by the month and nobody really controls their results.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Laziness&lt;/strong&gt;. Just like that apartment designers, programmers also love to get paid and do nothing. Who doesn’t, right? They will tell you that their work is more complicated than you think, that they need much more time, that they need to investigate the problem first, that reading documentation also takes a lot of time, etc. They are simply spoiled by the &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/10/06/how-to-be-good-office-slave.html&quot;&gt;traditional macro-tasking&lt;/a&gt; where they are paid by the month and nobody really controls their results. They are used to being &lt;del&gt;office slaves&lt;/del&gt; lazy. We solve that by &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/04/17/how-xdsd-is-different.html&quot;&gt;paying by result&lt;/a&gt; and the lazy ones simply quit.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Responsibility&lt;/strong&gt;.

We solve that by &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/09/24/why-monetary-awards-dont-work.html&quot;&gt;monetary rewards and punishments&lt;/a&gt;, which make them very motivated and failure-ready.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Resentment&lt;/strong&gt;. This is one of the most popular and the most annoying of problems: they will tell you that they are “not monkeys.” They will actually combine all problems listed above and say that the right way to solve them is to give programmers freedom and let them do their job, since they are smart enough and don’t need any management from the top.

However, it is absolutely affordable to accept a risk of a kitchen lamp installation. Even if it falls and breaks, we will spend a few dollars and buy a new one. We don’t need to control the “lamp person”—we have a luxury to delegate and trust.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;The benefits programmers get overlap with our benefits. If they are professional and motivated enough they find it effective and productive to work with micro tasks, which are always well defined and properly paid.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;are-we-monkeys-or-not&quot;&gt;Are we monkeys or not?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now the most typical complaint we hear about micro-tasking is: “It is for junior programmers who are OK with being code monkeys.” To be honest, I also thought so a few years ago, when we started to experiment with &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/04/17/how-xdsd-is-different.html&quot;&gt;XDSD&lt;/a&gt;. What I quickly found out is that the most professional and self-motivated developers were enjoying micro-tasking, while their less mature and less skilled colleagues were finding it difficult to keep up.&lt;/p&gt; "/> <meta name="twitter:url" property="og:url" content="https://www.yegor256.com/2017/11/28/microtasking.html"/> <meta name="telegram:channel" content="AAAAAEJFMRzsRTRxM3ec6A"/> <link

You hire a group of people and give them all your money up front. They ask you to come back in two months, when everything will be ready. You say “OK” and wait for two months. I’m sure you already know what I’m getting at—this project most probably will be a failure, to some extent. In the worst case you won’t see these guys ever, they will just steal your money. In the best case, they will do something that will look “nice,” but not as nice as you expected.</p><h2 id="why-do-we-micromanage">Why do we micromanage?</h2><p>What do you do in order to increase your chances of getting the best case scenario? That’s right, you micromanage them: you visit them every day, you ask them the famous “What are you doing now?” question, you push them when they are getting lazy, you control, you dominate, you annoy, you “stay on top,” you play the guilt card when they miss or forget, you <a href="/2016/01/05/how-to-punish-employees.html">punish</a> them every way you can.</p><aside class="quote">The more aggressive you are, the higher the chances you win.</aside><p>You don’t do that because you’re evil.

That’s why you have to resort to the last possible measure—micromanagement. Why is the project not manageable? Because its scope is not broken down into pieces. It contains a large single job called “Redesign The Apartment.”</p><p>One of the key success factors for manageability is the famous 0/100 rule, which requires any task to be either “in progress” or “complete.” There can be nothing in the middle. When such a rule is in place, the task can be delegated to its performer and they can become responsible for its completion, they can be trusted.</p><p>We can’t “trust” our single large task to the performer, simply because it’s too big to be trusted. If they fail, the cost of failure will be too high. We have to take a <em>micro</em>-scope and get into the task to manage it from the inside, annoying its performers, whom we are supposed to trust. The micromanagement we do is <em>inevitable</em>, because the scope is not broken down.</p><p>Scope decomposition was invented mostly in order to solve this very problem: to make the project more manageable. We need small tasks in the scope in order to be able to delegate them and never go inside in order to check what’s going on there, who is doing what, why, and where.</p><p>The smaller the tasks we can break the scope into, the better.</p><h2 id="how-small-can-tasks-be">How small can tasks be?</h2><p>In our projects we break project scope into tasks of 30 minutes each. This may sound too extreme for you, but it works for us. We call them micro-tasks. We started to practice micro-tasking about seven years ago. We experimented with different task sizes, from 10 hours to 15 minutes, but eventually came down to 30 minutes.</p><p>When tasks are bigger, we lose the manageability and simply get back to macro-tasking. When tasks are smaller, the context switching overhead becomes too annoying.</p><p>In our experience, a senior programmer, if fully dedicated to a project, completes 6-10 tasks a day. This means that they spend 3-5 hours working, while the rest of the time is spent on doing something else. This is a much more effective use of work time than we can achieve with traditional macro-tasking management, where programmers barely work for two hours a day, spending the rest of their time on something else (my personal observation).</p><h2 id="what-obstacles-did-we-have">What obstacles did we have?</h2><p>If you decide to go for micro-tasking, you will most likely have the same or similar obstacles that we’ve had. Here is a short list of them and my advice, which may help if one day you decide to break a “Develop a Mobile App” task into, say, 2,500+ micro tasks:</p><ul> <li><p><strong>Vagueness</strong>. Definition of done, exit criteria, requirements, expectations—there are many names, which are all about our inability to define what exactly we expect programmers to do. Software development by definition includes a lot of unknowns, creativity, experiments, and risks. Programmers will tell you that they can’t guarantee anything in most cases, and can’t really give any valid promises. We solve that by <a href="/2010/03/04/pdd.html">PDD</a>.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Distraction</strong>. Programmers are used to doing many different things at the same time: they write code, help others, watch YouTube, scroll Facebook, swear at Reddit, and read my blog. Initially most of them won’t like the idea of having explicit tasks in front of them, simply because they put a structure on their work time, making it much more visible to the management. They will tell you that they have many other things to do aside from your bloody tasks. We solve that by <a href="/2014/04/17/how-xdsd-is-different.html">paying by result</a> and <a href="/2014/10/07/stop-chatting-start-coding.html">prohibition of chitchats</a>.</p></li></ul><aside class="quote">They are simply spoiled by the traditional macro-tasking where they are paid by the month and nobody really controls their results.</aside><ul> <li><p><strong>Laziness</strong>. Just like that apartment designers, programmers also love to get paid and do nothing. Who doesn’t, right? They will tell you that their work is more complicated than you think, that they need much more time, that they need to investigate the problem first, that reading documentation also takes a lot of time, etc. They are simply spoiled by the <a href="/2015/10/06/how-to-be-good-office-slave.html">traditional macro-tasking</a> where they are paid by the month and nobody really controls their results. They are used to being <del>office slaves</del> lazy. We solve that by <a href="/2014/04/17/how-xdsd-is-different.html">paying by result</a> and the lazy ones simply quit.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Responsibility</strong>. Micro-tasking will make individual results visible. When tasks are large people tend to work with them in groups and it’s unclear exactly who is responsible for failures and successes. Smaller tasks emphasize mistakes and make people “pay” for them. Not necessarily with cash, but definitely some way or other. Most programmers will find this concept very new and disturbing—they’ve almost never paid for their own mistakes before and never had their own tasks. The responsibility was always spread across the group. We solve that by <a href="/2014/09/24/why-monetary-awards-dont-work.html">monetary rewards and punishments</a>, which make them very motivated and failure-ready.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Resentment</strong>. This is one of the most popular and the most annoying of problems: they will tell you that they are “not monkeys.” They will actually combine all problems listed above and say that the right way to solve them is to give programmers freedom and let them do their job, since they are smart enough and don’t need any management from the top. And they will mostly be saying it quite honestly, with no intent to manipulate. The thing is that they are used to macro-tasking and believe that this is the only and the right way. I’m trying to solve this by writing this very blog post.</p></li></ul><p>There could be something else, but this is a more or less an exhaustive list of the problems we were faced with.</p><h2 id="where-micro-tasking-didnt-work">Where micro-tasking didn’t work</h2><p>Obviously, any approach has its pros and cons. Micro-tasking seems to be the most effective management paradigm for us. However, it’s not applicable everywhere, according to our experience. There are territories where we failed to apply it.</p><ul> <li><p><strong>Prototyping</strong>. Every project or a new big feature starts with a prototype, which requires one or two people sitting next to each other, thinking, and experimenting. We tried to break this piece of work into smaller parts, but failed. It <a href="/2014/10/06/software-project-lifecycle.html">seems</a> that this process has to be done as a single solid work package.</p></li> <li><p><strong>UI/UX</strong>. We were mostly working with server-side Java/Ruby/C++ projects for the last few years and didn’t have many opportunities to apply micro-tasking to the UI/UX jobs. However, whatever we did try never really worked: graphic designers weren’t able to decompose their tasks into smaller parts.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Customers</strong>. We <a href="/2014/04/26/incremental-requirements-with-requs.html">tried</a> to decompose the task of eliciting requirements from our clients and failed a few times. Maybe our clients were stupid (I doubt that), maybe requirements were too complex, or maybe our system analysts were not professional enough. The bottom line is that we realized that such a task must be done as a solid piece of work, without any decomposition.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Fire-fighting</strong>. When the speed of delivery is the most important concern, micro-tasking doesn’t work for us. The overhead for dispatching and specifying tasks was taking too much time. When something is really urgent, we have to do the traditional macro-tasking and just “make it work.” Then we get back to micro-tasking.</p></li></ul><p>Everything else, including programming, unit testing, manual testing, performance/load testing, integration testing, deployment, code review, documentation, and even training, can and must be managed via micro tasks.</p><h2 id="what-benefits-do-we-get">What benefits do we get?</h2><p>The most important benefit of micro-tasking is that the project becomes more manageable, as was mentioned above. Here is a more detailed break down:</p><ul> <li><p><strong>Money works</strong>. When tasks are very small, we can use <a href="/2014/09/24/why-monetary-awards-dont-work.html">good old dollar bills</a> to motivate programmers. We can throw away literally <a href="/2015/03/02/team-morale-myths-and-reality.html">all other</a> instruments.</p></li> <li><p><strong>We pay less</strong>. We seriously lower our expenses, even though hourly rates of our programmers are <a href="/2014/10/29/how-much-do-you-cost.html">higher</a> than many other projects can afford. I did a more or less <a href="/2014/04/11/cost-of-loc.html">detailed analysis</a> a few years ago, which demonstrated that our projects were 30 (!) times more cost efficient than traditional ones.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Motivation is high</strong>. Despite a very common stereotype that small and isolated tasks demotivate their performers, we see quite the opposite reaction: programmers are excited when it finally becomes possible to work within well-defined and explicit boundaries, independently, and in isolation. Not all of them, <a href="/2018/01/09/micro-budgeting.html">though</a>. My personal observation is: only 25% of them can understand and enjoy micro-tasking. Others are either not professional enough or spoiled by <a href="/2015/10/06/how-to-be-good-office-slave.html">office slavery</a>, where it’s possible to do almost nothing and stay very respected and well rewarded.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Turnover is not painful</strong>. To make micro-tasking possible the management has to learn how to specify them: explicitly, unambiguously, and fast. When such a high level of transparency, formality, and agility (at the same time) is achieved, the project becomes less dependent on <a href="/2015/12/29/turnover-is-good-for-maintainability.html">experts</a>. We lose the fear of losing people, because almost everything we need to know about the project is inside our task tracking system and project documentation.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Easier to parallel</strong>. Smaller tasks are easier to delegate to a larger amount of programmers. In some projects we sometimes have over 40 programmers at the same time, while the amount of tasks is relatively small (up to 200).</p></li> <li><p><strong>Metrics work</strong>. When one programmer closes 40-50 tasks per week and another one closes 5-10, it does mean something, keeping in mind that all tasks are almost equal in size. We use this metric (and <a href="https://www.0crat.com/gang">a few others</a>) to make organizational and discipline decisions. In a macro-tasking environment almost no HR metrics really work.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Quality is enforceable</strong>. Large amounts of small tasks implies that we constantly and frequently close them. Each closure is an important point for quality control. That’s exactly where we have the ability to say “No” and reject the deliverables that violate our quality standards. With big tasks this “No” is much more painful for programmers.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Risks are acceptable</strong>. It’s impossible to accept the risk of the entire apartment redesign failure, since its cost is too high—a few thousand dollars. However, it is absolutely affordable to accept a risk of a kitchen lamp installation. Even if it falls and breaks, we will spend a few dollars and buy a new one. We don’t need to control the “lamp person”—we have a luxury to delegate and trust.</p></li></ul><p>The benefits programmers get overlap with our benefits. If they are professional and motivated enough they find it effective and productive to work with micro tasks, which are always well defined and properly paid.</p><h2 id="are-we-monkeys-or-not">Are we monkeys or not?</h2><p>Now the most typical complaint we hear about micro-tasking is: “It is for junior programmers who are OK with being code monkeys.” To be honest, I also thought so a few years ago, when we started to experiment with <a href="/2014/04/17/how-xdsd-is-different.html">XDSD</a>. What I quickly found out is that the most professional and self-motivated developers were enjoying micro-tasking, while their less mature and less skilled colleagues were finding it difficult to keep up.</p></p><nav class="buttons notranslate desktop-only"> <a href="http://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://www.yegor256.com/2017/11/28/microtasking.html" title="Share on Facebook" class="button" rel="nofollow"> <span class="count count-facebook">0</span> <i class="icon icon-facebook notranslate" aria-hidden="true"></i> </a> <a href="https://twitter.com/share?url=https://www.yegor256.com/2017/11/28/microtasking.html&amp;text=How+Micro+Is+Your+Tasking%3F" title="Share on Twitter" class="button" rel="nofollow"> <span class="count count-twitter">0</span> <i class="icon icon-twitter notranslate" aria-hidden="true"></i> </a> <a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=https://www.yegor256.com/2017/11/28/microtasking.html" title="Share on Google+" class="button" rel="nofollow"> <span class="count count-googleplus">0</span> <i class="icon icon-googleplus notranslate" aria-hidden="true"></i> </a> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/cws/share?url=https://www.yegor256.com/2017/11/28/microtasking.html" title="Share on LinkedIn" class="button" rel="nofollow"> <span class="count count-linkedin">0</span> <i class="icon icon-linkedin notranslate" aria-hidden="true"></i> </a> <a href="http://reddit.com/submit?url=https://www.yegor256.com/2017/11/28/microtasking.html%3F2017-48&amp;title=How+Micro+Is+Your+Tasking%3F" title="Share on Reddit" class="button" rel="nofollow"> <span class="count count-reddit">0</span> <i class="icon icon-reddit notranslate" aria-hidden="true"></i> </a> <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/submitlink?u=https://www.yegor256.com/2017/11/28/microtasking.html%3F2017-48&amp;t=How+Micro+Is+Your+Tasking%3F" title="Share on Hacker News" class="button" rel="nofollow"> <span class="count count-hackernews">0</span> <i class="icon icon-hackernews notranslate" aria-hidden="true"></i> </a> </nav> </header> <article class="main" itemprop="articleBody"><div ><p>“What are you doing now?”—when you hear this question from your boss, be aware: you’re dealing with a <a href="/2015/09/22/micromanagement.html">micromanager</a>.

And the first step to making the project manageable is to decompose its scope into smaller pieces.</p><figure class="jb_picture"><img itemprop="image" alt="Carlito&#39;s Way (1993) by Brian De Palma" src="/images/2017/11/carlitos-way.jpg" longdesc="#fa318a0d" /><figcaption id="fa318a0d">Carlito&#39;s Way (1993) by Brian De Palma</figcaption></figure><p>Imagine you want to re-design your apartment, having a few thousand dollars for this job.

I’m sure you already know what I’m getting at—this project most probably will be a failure, to some extent. In the worst case you won’t see these guys ever, they will just steal your money.

That’s why you have to resort to the last possible measure—micromanagement. Why is the project not manageable? Because its scope is not broken down into pieces. It contains a large single job called “Redesign The Apartment.”</p><p>One of the key success factors for manageability is the famous 0/100 rule, which requires any task to be either “in progress” or “complete.” There can be nothing in the middle. When such a rule is in place, the task can be delegated to its performer and they can become responsible for its completion, they can be trusted.</p><p>We can’t “trust” our single large task to the performer, simply because it’s too big to be trusted. If they fail, the cost of failure will be too high. We have to take a <em>micro</em>-scope and get into the task to manage it from the inside, annoying its performers, whom we are supposed to trust. The micromanagement we do is <em>inevitable</em>, because the scope is not broken down.</p><p>Scope decomposition was invented mostly in order to solve this very problem: to make the project more manageable. We need small tasks in the scope in order to be able to delegate them and never go inside in order to check what’s going on there, who is doing what, why, and where.</p><p>The smaller the tasks we can break the scope into, the better.</p><h2 id="how-small-can-tasks-be">How small can tasks be?</h2><p>In our projects we break project scope into tasks of 30 minutes each. This may sound too extreme for you, but it works for us. We call them micro-tasks. We started to practice micro-tasking about seven years ago. We experimented with different task sizes, from 10 hours to 15 minutes, but eventually came down to 30 minutes.</p><p>When tasks are bigger, we lose the manageability and simply get back to macro-tasking. When tasks are smaller, the context switching overhead becomes too annoying.</p><p>In our experience, a senior programmer, if fully dedicated to a project, completes 6-10 tasks a day. This means that they spend 3-5 hours working, while the rest of the time is spent on doing something else. This is a much more effective use of work time than we can achieve with traditional macro-tasking management, where programmers barely work for two hours a day, spending the rest of their time on something else (my personal observation).</p><h2 id="what-obstacles-did-we-have">What obstacles did we have?</h2><p>If you decide to go for micro-tasking, you will most likely have the same or similar obstacles that we’ve had. Here is a short list of them and my advice, which may help if one day you decide to break a “Develop a Mobile App” task into, say, 2,500+ micro tasks:</p><ul> <li><p><strong>Vagueness</strong>. Definition of done, exit criteria, requirements, expectations—there are many names, which are all about our inability to define what exactly we expect programmers to do. Software development by definition includes a lot of unknowns, creativity, experiments, and risks. Programmers will tell you that they can’t guarantee anything in most cases, and can’t really give any valid promises. We solve that by <a href="/2010/03/04/pdd.html">PDD</a>.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Distraction</strong>. Programmers are used to doing many different things at the same time: they write code, help others, watch YouTube, scroll Facebook, swear at Reddit, and read my blog. Initially most of them won’t like the idea of having explicit tasks in front of them, simply because they put a structure on their work time, making it much more visible to the management. They will tell you that they have many other things to do aside from your bloody tasks. We solve that by <a href="/2014/04/17/how-xdsd-is-different.html">paying by result</a> and <a href="/2014/10/07/stop-chatting-start-coding.html">prohibition of chitchats</a>.</p></li></ul><aside class="quote">They are simply spoiled by the traditional macro-tasking where they are paid by the month and nobody really controls their results.</aside><ul> <li><p><strong>Laziness</strong>. Just like that apartment designers, programmers also love to get paid and do nothing. Who doesn’t, right? They will tell you that their work is more complicated than you think, that they need much more time, that they need to investigate the problem first, that reading documentation also takes a lot of time, etc. They are simply spoiled by the <a href="/2015/10/06/how-to-be-good-office-slave.html">traditional macro-tasking</a> where they are paid by the month and nobody really controls their results. They are used to being <del>office slaves</del> lazy. We solve that by <a href="/2014/04/17/how-xdsd-is-different.html">paying by result</a> and the lazy ones simply quit.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Responsibility</strong>. Micro-tasking will make individual results visible. When tasks are large people tend to work with them in groups and it’s unclear exactly who is responsible for failures and successes. Smaller tasks emphasize mistakes and make people “pay” for them. Not necessarily with cash, but definitely some way or other. Most programmers will find this concept very new and disturbing—they’ve almost never paid for their own mistakes before and never had their own tasks. The responsibility was always spread across the group. We solve that by <a href="/2014/09/24/why-monetary-awards-dont-work.html">monetary rewards and punishments</a>, which make them very motivated and failure-ready.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Resentment</strong>. This is one of the most popular and the most annoying of problems: they will tell you that they are “not monkeys.” They will actually combine all problems listed above and say that the right way to solve them is to give programmers freedom and let them do their job, since they are smart enough and don’t need any management from the top. And they will mostly be saying it quite honestly, with no intent to manipulate. The thing is that they are used to macro-tasking and believe that this is the only and the right way. I’m trying to solve this by writing this very blog post.</p></li></ul><p>There could be something else, but this is a more or less an exhaustive list of the problems we were faced with.</p><h2 id="where-micro-tasking-didnt-work">Where micro-tasking didn’t work</h2><p>Obviously, any approach has its pros and cons. Micro-tasking seems to be the most effective management paradigm for us. However, it’s not applicable everywhere, according to our experience. There are territories where we failed to apply it.</p><ul> <li><p><strong>Prototyping</strong>. Every project or a new big feature starts with a prototype, which requires one or two people sitting next to each other, thinking, and experimenting. We tried to break this piece of work into smaller parts, but failed. It <a href="/2014/10/06/software-project-lifecycle.html">seems</a> that this process has to be done as a single solid work package.</p></li> <li><p><strong>UI/UX</strong>. We were mostly working with server-side Java/Ruby/C++ projects for the last few years and didn’t have many opportunities to apply micro-tasking to the UI/UX jobs. However, whatever we did try never really worked: graphic designers weren’t able to decompose their tasks into smaller parts.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Customers</strong>. We <a href="/2014/04/26/incremental-requirements-with-requs.html">tried</a> to decompose the task of eliciting requirements from our clients and failed a few times. Maybe our clients were stupid (I doubt that), maybe requirements were too complex, or maybe our system analysts were not professional enough. The bottom line is that we realized that such a task must be done as a solid piece of work, without any decomposition.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Fire-fighting</strong>. When the speed of delivery is the most important concern, micro-tasking doesn’t work for us. The overhead for dispatching and specifying tasks was taking too much time. When something is really urgent, we have to do the traditional macro-tasking and just “make it work.” Then we get back to micro-tasking.</p></li></ul><p>Everything else, including programming, unit testing, manual testing, performance/load testing, integration testing, deployment, code review, documentation, and even training, can and must be managed via micro tasks.</p><h2 id="what-benefits-do-we-get">What benefits do we get?</h2><p>The most important benefit of micro-tasking is that the project becomes more manageable, as was mentioned above. Here is a more detailed break down:</p><ul> <li><p><strong>Money works</strong>. When tasks are very small, we can use <a href="/2014/09/24/why-monetary-awards-dont-work.html">good old dollar bills</a> to motivate programmers. We can throw away literally <a href="/2015/03/02/team-morale-myths-and-reality.html">all other</a> instruments.</p></li> <li><p><strong>We pay less</strong>. We seriously lower our expenses, even though hourly rates of our programmers are <a href="/2014/10/29/how-much-do-you-cost.html">higher</a> than many other projects can afford. I did a more or less <a href="/2014/04/11/cost-of-loc.html">detailed analysis</a> a few years ago, which demonstrated that our projects were 30 (!) times more cost efficient than traditional ones.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Motivation is high</strong>. Despite a very common stereotype that small and isolated tasks demotivate their performers, we see quite the opposite reaction: programmers are excited when it finally becomes possible to work within well-defined and explicit boundaries, independently, and in isolation. Not all of them, <a href="/2018/01/09/micro-budgeting.html">though</a>. My personal observation is: only 25% of them can understand and enjoy micro-tasking. Others are either not professional enough or spoiled by <a href="/2015/10/06/how-to-be-good-office-slave.html">office slavery</a>, where it’s possible to do almost nothing and stay very respected and well rewarded.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Turnover is not painful</strong>. To make micro-tasking possible the management has to learn how to specify them: explicitly, unambiguously, and fast. When such a high level of transparency, formality, and agility (at the same time) is achieved, the project becomes less dependent on <a href="/2015/12/29/turnover-is-good-for-maintainability.html">experts</a>. We lose the fear of losing people, because almost everything we need to know about the project is inside our task tracking system and project documentation.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Easier to parallel</strong>. Smaller tasks are easier to delegate to a larger amount of programmers. In some projects we sometimes have over 40 programmers at the same time, while the amount of tasks is relatively small (up to 200).</p></li> <li><p><strong>Metrics work</strong>. When one programmer closes 40-50 tasks per week and another one closes 5-10, it does mean something, keeping in mind that all tasks are almost equal in size. We use this metric (and <a href="https://www.0crat.com/gang">a few others</a>) to make organizational and discipline decisions. In a macro-tasking environment almost no HR metrics really work.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Quality is enforceable</strong>. Large amounts of small tasks implies that we constantly and frequently close them. Each closure is an important point for quality control. That’s exactly where we have the ability to say “No” and reject the deliverables that violate our quality standards. With big tasks this “No” is much more painful for programmers.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Risks are acceptable</strong>. It’s impossible to accept the risk of the entire apartment redesign failure, since its cost is too high—a few thousand dollars. However, it is absolutely affordable to accept a risk of a kitchen lamp installation. Even if it falls and breaks, we will spend a few dollars and buy a new one. We don’t need to control the “lamp person”—we have a luxury to delegate and trust.</p></li></ul><p>The benefits programmers get overlap with our benefits. If they are professional and motivated enough they find it effective and productive to work with micro tasks, which are always well defined and properly paid.</p><h2 id="are-we-monkeys-or-not">Are we monkeys or not?</h2><p>Now the most typical complaint we hear about micro-tasking is: “It is for junior programmers who are OK with being code monkeys.” To be honest, I also thought so a few years ago, when we started to experiment with <a href="/2014/04/17/how-xdsd-is-different.html">XDSD</a>. What I quickly found out is that the most professional and self-motivated developers were enjoying micro-tasking, while their less mature and less skilled colleagues were finding it difficult to keep up.</p></div></article></div><div class="wrapper"> <related-posts /></div><div class="disqus" role="complementary"><p class="disqus_hint"> Please, use <a href="https://help.disqus.com/commenting/what-html-tags-are-allowed-within-comments">syntax highlighting</a> in your comments, to make them more readable.</p><div id="disqus_thread" class="disqus-thread"> <a>&nbsp;</a></div><script> var disqus_config = function () { this.page.url = document.location.href.split('?')[0].split('#')[0].replace('https://', 'http://');
