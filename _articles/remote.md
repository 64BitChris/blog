Imagination Is an Enemy of Quality

Letting programmers use each and every possible technique and format leads to code mess;
instead it's desirable to keep imagination under strict control.

Expressiveness is considered a virtue of programming languages.

For example:

First, syntax sugar is what many modern programming languages are proud of.

Second, DSL-ish libraries like Nokogirin in Ruby introduce new custom ways of doing things inside an existing programming language.

Third, weak and dynamic typing (Ruby) replace strong and static (Java).

However, static analysis tools are going in the opposite direction, making many expressive practices illegal, for example:

  * Ternary boolean operators

  *

Quality of code is a very important component of the overall product quality.

Readability of code is the key contributor to its quality.

It seems that the more expressive programmers are, the lower the readability.

Mostly because all programmers have their unique understanding of what is right and how the code should look like.

Uniformity of code makes it more readable to a bigger amount of people.
