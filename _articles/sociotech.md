An ability to hack algorithms and make data structures optimal
was a virtue of programmers a few decades ago; now the reality is
different and their ability to work remotely, communicate, and share
is more important.

In the 70s of the last century, when Microsoft and Apple were founded,
programming was an art, which only a limited group of dedicated
enthusiasts really knew how to do right. CPUs were rather slow,
personal computers had very limited amount of memory, and monitors
were lo-res. To create something decent a programmer literally had to
fight with the hardware limitations.

In order to win in this war programmers had to be both trained and talented in
computer science, which at that time was mostly about algorithms and data structures.
The first three volumes of the famous book _The Art of Computer Programming_ of
[Donald Knuth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Knuth),
a Stanford University professor and a
[Turing Award winner](https://amturing.acm.org/award_winners/knuth_1013846.cfm),
were published in 1968-1973.
This Bible of programming earned a [famous comment](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/400456/rewriting-the-bible-in-0s-and-1s/)
from Bill Gates: "It took incredible discipline, and several months, for me to read it."

Just creating a simple piece of software was a complex engineering task,
even though software engineering "emerged as a discipline in its own right"
only later in 1980s, as [Ian Sommerville](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Sommerville_%28academic%29)
said in [_Software Engineering_](https://amzn.to/2HlrI5P) book.

Most of programmers were calling themselves "[hackers](https://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/a-short-history-of-hack)."
Even though in the early 80s this word,
according to Steven Levy's book [_Hackers_](https://amzn.to/2Es93C4),
"had acquired a specific and negative connotation,"
since the 90s has become
"a shibboleth that identifies one as a member of the tribe,"
as linguist Geoff Nunberg
[pointed out](http://www.npr.org/blogs/alltechconsidered/2014/01/16/263088398/hackers-techies-what-to-call-san-franciscos-newcomers).

Being able to hack the software and the hardware was a virtue for a long time.
However, things have been changing dramatically in the last decade.

First of all, the _cost_ of computing power [gets cheaper every year](https://www.fool.com/investing/general/2013/04/19/the-simple-reason-why-computers-keep-getting-bette.aspx).
For example, one gigabyte of computer memory [costed](http://www.jcmit.com/memoryprice.htm)
about $1,000 in 2000.
Now in 2018 its price is less than $5. The price dropped two hundred times in just
eighteen years. The same is true for
[hard drives](http://ns1758.ca/winch/winchest.html), monitors, CPUs, and all
other hardware resources. As James Somers noticed in his analysis of industry problems in
[_The Coming Software Apocalypse_](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/09/saving-the-world-from-code/540393/):
"Computers had doubled in power every 18 months for the last 40 years."

Second, the growth of _open source_ is huge. The majority of software is available
now for free together with their source code, including operating systems,
graphic processors, compilers, editors, frameworks, cryptography
tools, and whatever we can only imagine. Programmers don't need to
write that much code anymore, all they need in most cases is to wire together the
components already available.

Third, the _population_ of programmers in the world keeps growing and they are
still in a deficit. In some European countries the demand for high-skilled
IT personnel is twice as high as the supply their markets can provide.
According to [Iamexpat.nl](https://www.iamexpat.nl/career/employment-news/gaps-dutch-labour-market-ict-tech-and-sales-skills-demand),
in The Netherlands there is "a whopping 76% of HR employees reported having difficulty
finding enough candidates with this qualification."

Fourth, programmers work _remotely_, not in offices and cubicles anymore.
Thanks to the growth of high-speed Internet,
conferencing software like [Zoom](http://www.zoom.us) and [Skype](http://www.skype.com),
messaging tools like [Slack](http://www.slack.com)
and
[Telegram](https://telegram.org/),
distributed repository managers like
[GitHub](https://github.com) and [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/),
and many other innovations, remote work became more comfortable that
its traditional in-the-office alternative.

Finally, the fifth change is the _salaries_ of programmers, which are sky
rocketing for the last few decades. In the same 2000, when one
gigabyte of memory costed $1,000, senior programmers
[were earning](http://markcunningham91.blogspot.com/2013/05/a-history-of-offers-to-software.html)
$80,000 in Silicon Valley. Now, in 2018, they are making
[three times more](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/22/technology/artificial-intelligence-experts-salaries.html),
while RAM is two hundred times cheaper.

Taking these five factors into account, it seems that the skills,
professional and successful programmers are now required to have, seriously
differ from the ones they needed in the 90s. They need less mathematics
and algorithms and more skills under an umbrella term "sociotech."
According to Susan Long and her book [_Socioanalytic Methods_](https://amzn.to/2uTJ1rS),
the term "[sociotechnical systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sociotechnical_system)"
was coined by Eric Trist et al., in the World War II era, based on their work with workers
in English coal mines at the Tavistock Institute in London. It seems to be
suitable to the new skills and techniques modern programmers need.

They need to khow how to _communicate_ with the open source community, in order
to find the needed components and request features and bug fixes from
their developers. Moreover, they have to be ready to contribute to open
source software by submitting pull requests or even creating their own
programs. Those who used to work only with commercial and private software
will soon be way behind.

They have to know how to _get help_ outside of an office or even outside of
a project team, when working remotely and alone. Aside from
[StackOverlow](http://www.stackoverflow.com), which is the dominating
Q&A platform at the market of programming, there are documentation and
code repositories, which a professional programmer must know how to navigate.
Those who used to rely on colleagues and friends will lose to those
who know how to learn from the entire Internet.

They have to know how to write understandable and maintainable code, which
other programmers will be able to understand easily. Since personnel is
getting more expensive every year, businesses care a lot about the maintainability
of their code bases. They simply can't afford to lose what previous
programmers created when a new team or a replacement shows up and fails
to understand and modify. Those "hackers" who used to write complex and cryptic
software will soon be out of the market. "Simplicity is a great virtue"
as [Edsger W. Dijkstra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edsger_W._Dijkstra) once said.

It seems that the future of programming is less about math and more about
sociotech relationships between people.
